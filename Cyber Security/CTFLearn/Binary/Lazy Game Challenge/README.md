# Lazy Game Challenge
 
## Abridged Problem Statement
Pwn the program here to get the flag `nc thekidofarcrania.com 10001`

# Solution
Bet a negative value, and keep guessing 11 (a number greater than 10, so that you don't end up guessing it correctly for some reason)

```
Sorry you didn't made it !
Play Again !...
Better Luck next Time !.
Sorry you lost some money !..
Your balance has been updated !.
Current balance :  : 
10000000000000000000000000000500$

What the... how did you get that money (even when I tried to stop you)!? I guess you beat me!

The flag is CTFlearn{d9029a08c55b936cbc9a30_i_wish_real_betting_games_were_like_this!}
