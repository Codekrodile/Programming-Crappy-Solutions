Fine. I made it a bit more secure by not just leaving it directly in the code.

# Solution

The functions in the code basically check each substring of the input at a time. 

Parsing together the input flags in the functions (Both functions `checkpass()` and `catcheckpass()` check for the same flag, you get `rtcp{y34H_tHiS_a1nT_sEcuR3}`

# Flag
`rtcp{y34H_tHiS_a1nT_sEcuR3}`
