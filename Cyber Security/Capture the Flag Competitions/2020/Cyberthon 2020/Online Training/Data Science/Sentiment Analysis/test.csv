17,"I really liked this course, I think it has broadened my mind to a whole world that my heart and my intellect were expecting for so long. I enjoyed every single part, from the classes to the activities. The only think I would add at some point (maybe towards the end), would be an expert's feedback so we can challenge ourselves a little bit more. I would really recommend it and of course, I will keep going with the specialization."
18,"It first, i didn't know what to expect; i thought it was going to be pretty hard, because of my lack of experience in that specific area. It turns out that every lesson is perfectly explained,the quires are not easy tough!Highly recommended!"
19,It's very very good! I have been searching it over the past years!
20,"Well done. Logical progression of learning, good examples, clearly spoken. There were quite a few spots where sound or video cut out for several minutes while the other (either sound or video) continued to work. Not sure if it was my computer or a course issue. One quit (i believe week 10 or 11) had a question with two right answers. You could either choose 3) all of the above or 4) answers 1&2 (which were both correct). I believe '4' was the correct answer. Very well created overall...nice job."

47,A gateway to a brilliant side of the economy
48,I have been waiting for a Organ language course with course for a long time. it is very good course for beginner; I had all the explanations and the pronunciation technique were helpful.
49,"That I loved about this course, is that it was full of of best-practices, such as using life's for everything, using array to protect against minimization, and splitting out code into small, discrete files. I learned a lot of Angular, but I think I learned even more plain JavaScript. (I've written javascript for years, but evidently not well) In fact, almost every example of angular code I've looked at outside this course seems to ignore clot of these 'basis', so Thank-You.I would LOVE a recommendation for an Angular 2 course that is taught with a similar quality and attention to detail."

60,His is a excellent source for learning about influencing others and Now to protect yourself from others influence.
61,"The Tax part was my favorite part of the course, i'll not give a five star because third week for me was a little to much talk, i know its important to talk about getting speck with the client or following a wireframe, but we have another courses for that, and sometimes that was not how it happens in the real world"
62,"very good,thank you ,professor."
63,In excellent course with a broad coverage of topics presented at a relatively sophisticated conceptual level but still easy to understand and requiring little path. A great starting point for getting a comprehensive overview of astronomy at its current stage of development with insight into future directions.
64,"His course is exciting opportunity to ""connect the dots"" in introductory statistics. It is challenging, but very information and engaging."
65,"Some lectures were quite interesting but the general course level is very low. Furthermore, I think several topics is missing which I believed the course would cover like GLP Box, CMC, IND filing and the topics which are covered should be covered in more depth."
66,It was good but according to me it had a purity of arguing programming for which i enrolled . However it was still helpful and i enjoyed it .
67,Pretty good course as part of the specialization.
68,"A good course, the methods and pace was not good enough. I wonder if those new to these topics learnt anything"
69,"The course was nice but not structures very good, especially week 4. From time to time you have a feeling that this course is more like a compilation of lectures made for other courses with similar topic. Especially confusing are moments when during the lecture author references previous materials you expected to know from lectures you've never heard. That's strange."
70,It was a nice course. I could learn many new technique and algorithms. Very exciting !!
71,it.s easy to understand.
72,Course content is good. I was able to get the basic understanding of git and github and also understood how it works.

83,Very clear instruction
84,nice and great experience
85,By now ( during the specialization) one of the most challenging courses. But worth the effort.

94,Great course!
95,"really very interesting! Vice lessons, powerpoint and exercises!"

102,"Briefly introduce some concepts of the drug use and some in neuroscience, a good introduction course."
103,"His course is good to improve the listening skill, but the note taking is really boring, because it is focused in only one method, the Lowell Note, His disregard individual differences, and I don´t think this method is the best for me."
104,Simple. Informative. Seat and smart.
105,The course educated about all the aspects of valuation
106,"Wonderful course, it forced me to depend on myself. I had to search, I had to read and go through lots of articles, questions, solutions and tutorials online and also, in the discussion board to solve the assignment. I believe it is the best way for someone to get knee deep and learn the language. His is exactly the methodology that should be followed in the real world. One would have to search and find solutions for any issues that are encountered. I enjoyed it and moving on to completing the specialization."

109,nice course! Interesting and information
110,Very fun and the knowledge is practical!
111,"I enjoyed the first course in the series, but was slightly worried the specialization would all be too focused on the GraphLab product specifically. His course is proving that Parlor and Emily intend for us to truly understand the concepts and algorithms behind machine learning. For anyone on the fence that is concerned about this, you will learn how to implement machine learning in ANY package. In fact you will learn how to do it with no package at all! Thanks so much to Parlor and Emily and the Coursera staff, this is great!"
112,"In my opinion, I've tried other courses that teach patron but this is the by far 100/100. not only teach you about the language but also reaches you about things like memory and how a programming language works under the hood. By best recommendation if you are a beginner or an intermediate."
113,"Or. Reverence is highly gifted as a teacher. To make a complex world of programming easy to understand for the likes of me, it takes one that is thoroughly proficient in the subject and dedicated to teaching. I will continue these courses. Thank you, do!"
114,A perfect place for beginners in web programming
115,Good quick general overview for a complete beginner. Wished it could have been longer with a bit more depth.

121,Excellent course! Informative theoretical course and great practical exercises.
122,I Moved this class.
123,Very difficult. Needs homework problems guided by video like Statistical Inference coarse to make easier.

125,"To far, so good! Must about to start week 2 of this course and it has been good so far."
126,"Even better than part 1! But a small cadet, this is not for new grass or people just starting a business - choose some of the University of Maryland entrepreneur classes instead for that. That said, a must for people with 3+ years in business."
127,Very insightful. You're not just learning the algorithms themselves but also smart ways for choosing the right parameter values (which I found most valuable). The programming exercises are some what challenging but much fun to do. Buds to Andrew for the material.
128,The course has some good technical and analytical understanding of of tools and application plus the of project helped me derive useful visualizations. His course has helped me build my analytical skill to a different level which I think is expected in the actual of industry.
129,The class is interesting.
130,"I have just completed week 5 successfully. That a eye-opening positive course which I have found has helped me in my personal life as I have introduced new things as a result. Very worthwhile doing, presented well too"
131,Very good course for beginners with interest in information technology.
132,It highlight some bad habits in my life that I can try to eliminate in order to improve efficiency while providing better habits to replace them with. It's also a fairly easy course to complete (you don't even need half a day).
133,On't think that I've ever had a teacher that is as detailed. He has great knowledge and makes the course entertaining.
134,It's very good.I got what I want from this course and i will continue to learn.

161,"His course is very information, it discusses a broad of things regarding digital manufacturing, and it can put you on the right track by letting you know about the industrial revolutions, where are you standing, and which field do you want to proceed and work in. I recommend it to anyone who wants to start a career in manufacturing, even those who are already in the field and want to refresh their information or to know broader information regarding what they are missing, or want to upgrade their factory's systems.

Thanks so much professor Andrew G for sharing your knowledge!
175,"Very Good Course which primarily focused on India's First and Second Generation Economic Reforms.I would personally recommend following the course 'Importance of India'after that of 'Contemporary India"" as the latter provides a solid introduction to University of OHIO based former course.I had to low off one star because the course content tended to stray off limits in Weeks 6 and 7;To be honest, To straight to the test after completing Week 5; which i view as the end of this course."

212,"I promise, this is one of the best MOOC that exist in the whole internet. Absolutely recommended for anyone."
213,"Very poorly presented course. Despite having completed quite a number of course courses before, and even being already familiar with a good deal of the preliminary material in this one, i soon abandoned it due to the inadequate and scrappily prepared presentation of material. Precedes Paniccia in particular speaks in a virtually unintelligible expressionless monotony with no explanation or evaporation to relieve what amounts to little more than a list of definitions and bald statements such as can be found in the glossy section of many textbook. I would strongly recommend finding an alternative course devoted to the subject or maybe seeking out a readable textbook."
214,Any good tips on learning and tests :)
215,amazing course i got more out of this than 12 years of school!
216,It was my choice to join this course and now I am so glad its easy to learn and remember everything easily. A Fig thanks to my Teachers.

221,"His class had hard quit.Sometimes it seemed very basic, but some are hard unless you read and learn really well. Great class/knowledge. Practical real-life examples help."
222,It is very helpful to now about sustainable development
223,First time taking on R after so many years! Great and information course!
224,"Excellent Professor!!! Not the same old boring history course! Prof. Zelikow really digs into history and poses the fundamental question ""Why?"""
225,It helped me to open my eyes! Really great! Thank you all!
226,"Excellent course. It's perfect to get a solid base to learn music. The explanations are clear, the progression of the contents is easy to follow. I highly recommend it. Thank"

238,The best introductory of course
239,Great course. Take you think like a scientist.
240,really enjoyed it.
241,"Very good material and I'm grateful they provided it. There were many issues with the problem sets: incorrect, unclear, beyond scope of course, placed in wrong order of content. I reported all of these and never got even one response, perhaps because I'm not a paying customer. I had considered paying for the certificate but the more issues I encountered the more I was relieved not to have paid. But a great course nonetheless."
242,It was a good course and very thorough. I did get a bit lost during the Javascript module. A lot of detail in a short period of time. Would prefer if that module might be simplifies.
243,excellent course: topics are well explained and easy to follow.
244,"I didn't finish the course.... For one simple reason, I became so enamoured with the teacher's way of explaining that I purchased the book.

Due to A, Catherine and the team, the content, research, production with graphics, and reading ----- the weeks' lessons far exceeded my expectations. The trick with learning is applying what I have learned, so that is my intent. Oats off to enhancing sometimes hard-to-grasp concepts through video, interviews and quires. The online format and technical process worked 100% fine for me without any problems or stitches. I have been happy with everything! Thank you! Learner of"

268,"good course, teach much about entrepreneurship... Unfortunately, most of the examples are by and only U.S citizens =("
269,"With much self-initiative and supplementary materials/tutorials found elsewhere on the web , I was able to grasp the concepts of this class. Of you are self-driven and intellectual curious, this class is for you. OTOH, Of you expect everything spoon-fed to you, then you will not pass. Must have a passion herself-taught learning and finding/reading/grasping content, particularly as concerns javascript. Practiceand repetition are the only way to succeed with javascript."
270,"Good professor, great course, great specialization!"
271,Excellent Course! Thoroughly enjoyed it.

276,Well presented and information!
277,"You will really learn responsive web design.Great courses, great professors, great assignment."

279,"he is the man!!! fantastic, an all american pioneer"
280,The course is good for providing introduction to Forensic accounting. That would be good is to include some analytical tools or examples of how exactly text analysis will help us find fraudsters. Overall the pace and content is good.
281,Bravo and thanks!
282,The only problem on this journey with Jogesh sir is that it seems like I have got to know his quickness so well that he feels like someone I would love to know personally but can't! I enjoy the way he seems to simplify concepts and bring them together in the end to make even the most difficult concept seem entirely simple.
283,Amazing Professor

290,"Good course at an appropriate level. I'd like to see more advanced topics in a related course, like optimization, multi-treading, database management. Some discussion of non-relations database would also make sense."
291,Easy to grasp. Love that I can listen to lecture daytime.
292,Too many weeks - it's the biggest problem for me
293,In amazing introductory course ! and Or. Chagpar has a unique teaching style
294,Great course for learning the basic and intermediate level of epigenetics.
295,Excellent class for learning how to make and analyze database with Python.
296,"I have to say thanks to Or Annemarie And Scholten. I can feel how much efforts she had put into the lectures. Complex contents are simplifies and easy to learn even for a non-native English speaker like me. I'm happy because I joint this course, very useful, an enjoyable experience."
297,"Great course. Some week were tough others too easy, but general a very interesting course."
298,"Great presentation, great explanation by Or. Anger."
299,"His is nice! Fool interviews, nice pace. Some of the terms are unnecessarily redundant, but in overall they make sense and paint a clear picture."
300,Pretty Robust!
301,it is a great start for people who want to learn how to code for the very first time
302,Very nice course for someone who wants to learn basic concepts of Unity. By suggestion: create more challenging assignment
303,too simple.
304,Excellent! The course has an easy and kind format to new R-programme.
305,Very useful course.
306,I think this course was the most complex of the courses to this point. Prof. Harris shines in his ability to clarify the complexities. It really is a gift. It this point I can begin to see how all of what we are learning comes together.
307,"I feel that the training could be more extensive prior to assignment. The assignment often cause me to random search packages for correct functions to use and how to apply proper santa, etc."
308,Extremely interesting while also being organized and well taught. I feel extremely prepared for any future endeavors in machine learning and that this has given me the perfect foundations for such things. Highly recommend to anybody interested in learning about machine learning.
309,Really great work so far! One of the best courses i have taken!
310,The perfect way the starting learning about of!
311,"The concepts of thinking, diffused and focused mode or learning, memory, recall, space repetition and and beating procrastinator through immersing in the process that leads to a product were beautifully introduced in this course by Barbara Valley and her co-instructor. The material is presented in such a nice way that makes someone readily identify with what one needs to do in order to become a better learner.I recommend this course to everyone regardless of how skillful at learning they are. Understanding your brain and memories is a nice exercise on your road to mastering tough subjects. Buds Barbara"
312,Very good introductory course to probability and data. Very hands-on examples and outstanding explanations. I already had several statistics courses before in my life but not in this quality. I can really recommend this course to anyone who to learn more about statistics.
313,I thought it was going to be good. Did the first week video and Lectures. But I feel created because it will not let me take the quit to move on without paying for the course. To where did I ever see anything that said ahead you had to pay -- if you didn't want a certificate or to do the whole specialization. Coursera used to be a platform I used and recommended. To more.
314,Thank you for this best lecture.
315,"In enlightening course. Opens my mind to a wide vista of new ways of thinking and living. Practical with seemingly endless tools for the mind. Prof. Age provides a wide variety of examples that are reliable.The best thing for me is how Prof. Age feels reliable and unapproachable in his teaching style - he seems to really want students to understand what he's teaching and meeting us where we are, providing excellent scaffolding along the way."
316,"The best course i ever attend to.Lectures are very good and the Teacher Jogesh K. Muppala is the West of the West, keep up with the excellent job."
317,Excellent in content and delivery!!!!
318,Of you could create a course Apology as good as this one it would be heavenly.Thanks
319,His course is intended to provide the concepts of Happiness what it is and how we relate to it. Prof A is amazing at explaining all this in details yet in common man simplicity.
320,Quizzes are extremely subjective and hard to pass. Wouldn't find direct relation between content and questions. Cultural barriers might be to blame.
321,A great course!
322,Must Now
323,"Of you think that epigenetics is just about DNA methylation, you are wrong and need to watch this course. It is fascinating ! It is full of new scientific materials and bizarre phenomenon such as ""X chromosome kissing"" offered by a nice presentation and wonderful moves."
324,I have learned Chinese little by little!
325,Vice course and Tutor :)
326,"Very easy to follow, comprehensive introduction to machine learning. Concepts were very clearly explained in the lectures, and homework assignment focused on actually implementing the concepts from the lectures. Practical tips for how to implement machine learning in a real situation were very valuable. His course made me want to learn more about this subject, and to find ways to use these technique in my work."
327,Excellent course to start learning organ. The lessons are easy to follow and it is really helpful if you don't know anything about organ.
328,Great introduction to the subject with good classification examples using R.
329,That I've learn the most in this course is designing a responsive layout for most devices.
330,get work . get way to explain things. enjoyed a lot
331,"A great course approaching many aspects of addition, both behavior studies as well neurosciences aspects."
332,"Not enough teaching from the professors , just presentation sides. Which kind of reduced the human component of learning."
333,The video that aren't boring and long! His course filled in the gaps that I had after taking university classes. I don't really like the final project is peer reviewed. Your peers can prevent you from passing the course.
334,It's great. I really enjoyed it!
335,tough concepts are explained in a easy manner.
336,It is very good for someone to have basic knowledge in this subject and want to st
337,It was an amazing experience.
338,"Absolutely worth your time to learn basic knowledge of Machine Learning. But I do find that this course is actually a simplifies version of regular of course. To if you want to dig deeper into of, this might not be the best choice for you. But it is definitely the best course for beginners!"
339,cool
340,I got a lot of fun while doing this course.
341,The course seems to be useful but the tasks become hell. You need either give more information and examples or decrease the complexity of the questions and tasks
342,"Good for beginners, introduced basic theory system. But a few mistakes appeared, though corrected in the video too, but better to clear them in the future shifts."
343,First I didn't like it but throughout the course it became more and more engaging and gave more relevant and practical information
344,Very complete finance Course. Robert Miller is a very good professor
345,"Things are getting clearer in my mind, thanks to these wonderful teachers."
346,"His is a really great course. The topic of discussion is not only very important and urgent but also very interesting. The interviews of each week were really well done and the people interview are experts in their field. The course is challenging, but the feedback of the other students is very serious and suppurative."
347,In excellent course with a great design! Learned a lot and was able to apply it in such a way that made it personal and made the material more tangible. I look forward to more courses from these instructor and this institution.
348,"Normally, I get bored so early; however, in this course I didn't get bored and I learn so many things that will help me in studying for my lessons. The shorter lesson, the more success. Thank you for that you provide this opportunity for us."

355,"Simple, concise and easy to understand."
356,"Really awesome instructor! He walks you through everything. He assumes you know little about computers and programming, which is great for people trying to gain a deep understanding of why things work the way they do. Really helpful introduction to ArcGIS!"
357,"The contents of the course are definitely insightful and appropriately based on scientific research. Or. Are Urban is extremely knowleadgeable on the topic.The reason why I am not giving the course a higher rate is because: 1) I find the pace of the course is quite slow, 2) the inactivity in the discussion forms and the lack of peer reviews in the assignment reduces its interactivity and 3) both the contents and trading system are very theoretical.Still, I would recommend this course as it provides a solid foundation on the principles behind the dynamic of culture."
358,Well done MOOC. Material was very clearly presented by excellent instructor.
359,One of the best Coursera courses! Daniel Wakens for the win!
360,"Simple, succinct and very useful information. Basis on nutrition clearly explained and very easy to understand and remember."

385,Excellent Course! Very course is very clear and programming assignment is well-designed.
386,Good course for anyone like to learn management of projects and how to start it
387,"The idea of having support with the video does not work with this course. Also, the exam do not match at all with the information provided. The answers to the exam are so relative or subjective, and that's a problem for those who does not domain English very well, just like me."
388,"Very useful for robotic beginners, the idea is clear and the explanation is helpful."
389,Brilliant Course! Caught me a lot of concepts in very few lecture video and was fun! Buds to Charles
390,Very good overview of the key technologies
391,"His course contains very us full knowledge for me, thank you very much."
392,Excellent course filled with many ideas you can use immediately. His is a good mix of science and real-world experience that will improve the way you learn new skill.
393,Prof. Muppala is a great instructor. His was a very engaging course.
394,Great
395,"I loved the elaborate structure, but they should provide a certificate"
396,Great classes and material.
397,"Excellent approach to explaining the theory. The emphasis on getting the fundamentals right was a welcome change from other similar courses which get into problem solving mode too soon without clarifying the basis. That being said the usage of multiple real world problems like Only All, Prosecutor's Dilemma and the brilliant explanation for solutions helped me derive great clarity on key concepts. The best Coursera course I have encountered in a while."
398,The course is very good. It is not so easy to pass the quires but it does get you hooked on HTML
399,"I liked this course very much. Initially my target is to develop some code for CFD domain, when i am searching for suitable language I heard about Python credentials, but the problem is no one is expert in my locality and it is too expensive. But thanks to Coursera and my sincere gratitude to Or. chuck, it all happened so..Thanks you so much...."
400,Great course and instructor! Thanks!
401,"Very good, practical, just to the point, with lots of quotes and evidence on studies that support course affirmation. Really enjoyable!"
402,"I just don't understand why this is not reached in school.Some of this you might have figured out but this course will enable you to plan in a systematic way how you study and remember what you study. Very insightful on the study process. I am glad this is the first course I took on Coursera, it will help me so much with the other courses I intend to attend.Thanks again for providing this course!"
403,"His course build on the first one and allowed me to build a complex interactive web application. The last week was quite challenging but the examples were quite sufficient if one makes sure to write all of the code and understand it, especially if you're new to web de like me! The instructor are amazing communicates.Regards,Conan ZuberiToronto, Canada"
404,"Oris is fantastic. Of you are a manager looking to sharpen your skill, look no further. G"
405,PERFECT PERFECT! I wish this course was here 2 years ago. The materials are so useful and the mock interview too. Well done Professors!

409,Satisfy with the content
410,"Great course, easy to follow"
411,Is previous courses part of Investment Management specialization this is a very useful and at times challenging course for those who are interested in the financial field. Buds to all teachers and thank you Coursera for offering these materials through your platform. Such appreciated!
412,Great introduction to the big history concept. Awesome production. Content of the last two weeks is significantly weaker than the rest though
413,Awesome job by Margaret.
414,Clear explanation and well presented course. Covers the basis of the bootstrap grid system well.
415,Fantastic. Very glad to have taken this course.
416,"His course allow me to become familiar with Fig Data terminology and concepts, big data platforms and related applications. o believe this course this is the fattest way to get into the fig dATA WORLD."
417,Excellent way to step into the Python world!! On't estate join this course. But be aware that this is the third and you have to start from the first course (Programming for everybody).
418,"I would expect to know a little bit more about the details. For example, <did> why we use this tag so often?"
419,Very good course
420,Good One.
421,About clotting in R. Not about generation real insight from EDA.
422,Basis are good
423,"It is a great course, they should just expand more and do more questions, the TMBOK guide goes why deeper, they should also but nether the less it is a great course"
424,Had no experience with access web data and this class made it clear how to do it.
425,"Well planned!! course, gives you insight into research planning and time management. Professional suggestions and tips are worth. Great experience and learning."

432,Course was easy to navigable and learn.
433,Easy going introduction to the topic.
434,"Met another excellent Scala class. Good lectures, good assignment. Clear and understandable, while presenting a whole bunch of new concepts."
435,Wonderful course! I found it very information!
436,"Course is of, not too information and not too poor."
437,"The books, reading, and additional resources for studying are really good and helpful. The only thing is that the video where they explain the courses could be more fluid, dynamic and with a better domain of the tool by the professor."
438,Pretty hard to Deep track but the content was good.I probably need to be a bit more focused next time.
439,Great introductory course for repression analysis and very practical indeed!
440,Really useful to learn how to interact wit web resources from patron
441,"It is really great step-by-step tutoring which helps you to make first steps with patron. Good samples, easy to get content, nice additional materials."
442,"Great overview. The Will exercises are wonderful for ""teaching a person to fish""."
443,His was an easy to understand and absolutely MARVELOUS course!Any-many-many thanks to authors!
444,"Very good course, very bad accent:) even being Russian I could hardly understand sometimes"
445,"Great course, thanks. Very interesting content."
446,Not so relevant with real work.
447,"Certain aspects of the course could be improved, particularly in the way the material is presented. There could also be more focus on what is important rather than unnecessary etymologies and listing of names which doesn't add to any conceptual understanding. That time could rather be used to go into more depth with some of the practices.http://evidenceandreason.wordpress.com/2017/01/29/review-magic-in-the-middle-ages/"
448,"One of the best courses I've ever had. Breathtaking, exciting, absorbing!"
449,"While I appreciate this class for attempting to tackle a complicated topic, it was too hard for me to follow, and the peer assignment trading public is too arbitrary. Perhaps it is designed for those who are more analytical than myself.. Such as developer... (I am a writer). Although I liked the topic, I will not be taking more classes with this instructor."
450,Very useful and didactic.
451,It really opened my mind.
452,Awesome. Waiting for the next one.
453,"A nice and flexible course, in which you can explore the wide range of possibilities from the minimum basic level of subject to studying all the additional material and problematical. Father interesting functional approach to the structure of philosophical knowledge. For the foreigners (as I am) the English is quite understandable (It is submitted, but the subtitles are not necessary if you are above Of / IELTS 7.0 level) and at the same time sufficiently sophisticated to acquire also some useful listening practice for academic IELTS / PTE Academic tests."
454,May too many errors in the grade assignment. On-responsive teaching assistants.
455,I've learned lots of new things
456,"Excellent class, very instructive"
457,Enjoyed this course!Seemed fast-paced at the end but overall the best course so far i have ever took.
458,Thank you so much for this course. Really... very necessary and important for people who loves music.
459,Very nice overview of the major revenue issues facing hotels today
460,"Really solid course for a basic rounding in CSS3, only wish it had more about responsive design."
461,Really
462,Extremely practical. I'm already applying many concepts and the experience is wonderful.
463,"Useful for the beginners with no economic background. English is a great advantage, since one has to check the terms in one's own language, developing language skill. The only drawback for me is that by the time I finished some lessons (which could take up to five days), I had forgotten a lot of material (especially the formula), so I had to go back and revise."
464,"His course is real, interactive and interesting. I learnt a lot"
465,"Very brief and still concise presentation of both functional programming and Scala santa and features. For my first course of functional programming, I think it gave me basic knowledge and skill to use functional programming features."
466,Excellent course and specialization.
467,"The class was a little brief, but I really did enjoy the way it was presented. The real life situation, with video, and a famous company made this hit close to home. I really enjoyed the ""choose your own adventure"" format of it as well. Unfortunately it was so brief, where the $49 price seemed a little high in comparison to the content that was available in the other sources in the Executive Specialization series. I also would have liked a longer or more in-depth scenario. Lastly, for any of the ""wrong choice"" that were chosen, a brief ""why"" they were wrong would have also helped. Even though there is room for improvement (and thus a 4 star rating and not a 5), I really did enjoy it and found it to be a very enjoyable way to end the series."
468,Gives good overview of data science. Maybe one example would have been better.
469,it was a good course which helped me track and manage my time
470,Such an useful course ever.
471,"In the first week the course gave a bonus video called Teacher Talk. His could be gave for each week, a great lecture based on theories and technique taught during the course, recorded from real world classes."
472,Great course!
473,Very information and logical.
474,"I learned a lot about lesson planning, objective writing and designing the assessment to align all the course elements."
475,Very clear and structures material delivered by a great lecturer. Close-to-real-life examples and advice concerning cutting edge developing tools are really helpful.
476,great course
477,"To me as a beginner, it's a great course"
478,"The last assignment caused me CONFUSION. I mean, due to the unclear assignment requirements, we cannot review composition for composition's sake. For example, I did use two squares as the assignment asked, but I changed the transparent of them, so they form a new square when overlapping. And people think I used three squares and thus not following the instructions. And many people used a small circle and a large circle putting at the center vertically to form a scale composition, and you have to give them 3 points because they followed the instructions, but they actually did not do much in terms of composition. Though I got 3.5 scores by two people ( not very bad）, I'm still frustrated, and I hope the assignment requirements could be clearer."
479,The course was a great stepping stone on my way to PMP. Thank you!
480,The strongest part of this course is that it prompt the earners to apply the designing skill.
481,A perfect introduction into the topic
482,Great course!
483,Great for beginners in Data Science. Lecturer are good and instructor are very knowledgeable and provided valuable input through short duration lectures.
484,I liked it a lot!
485,The best choice to start with Python!
486,Very happy with the way nodules are structures. will recommend this to everyone irrespective of age and background
487,Great introduction/reminder.
488,His course gives a simple but clear bone structure upon which to hang further study on the topic.
489,"Great teacher, great guidelineBest of MOOC ever !!"
490,"One of the best programming courses to get started. Python should be the #1 choice for anyone who's willing to kick start their journey to programming. Plus, Or. Chuck is an amazing instructor. He takes his time to explain the material well. The lectures are easy to follow but the assignment might seem a bit challenging some times. However, the assignment are not impossible and if you try you'll definitely will be able to do it. I highly recommend this course."
491,"A great opportunity to develop my skill. It was offered me a very organized course with an excellent didactic and professional instructor. Congrats too all at Penn, you were wonderful!! #TrumpIsPresident"
492,Lessons are really easy to understand and the material is quite professional.
493,Excellent course and teacher! Right energy for people like me. ;)
494,His is priceless.
495,"I use Expel constantly at work, but I have frequently gotten information from it the hard way. His course helped me increase my knowledge in some Expel functions that I knew about, but wasn't getting the most out of, such as Riot Tables. I have already applied what I learned in this course at work and THAT is about the best that you can hope for from a class."
496,I like it very much.
497,Very helpful for studying
498,"i did like this course very much ,many many new ideas,option and mental tools i had no ideas about them before ,well i want to have more time with it ,very short time."
499,"It's been a great experience to now deep this amazing Peter Finger's proposal. I appreciate a lot the way that ethical ideas, feelings and projects are exposed and shared with all of us. The result is not only to get more knowledge about effective altruism but to have the chance of changing our lives."
500,I found this to be very useful in getting started with both C and the Arduino - neither of which I've studied/used before. I felt the lectures were well delivered and the video of the Arduino board and circuit helped me to connect components correctly. I suspect some of the problems I experienced in submitting my projects might be resolved through some more detailed advice within the course notes. I'm looking forward very much to the companion course involving interlacing with the Arduino.
501,Very useful course for me and for my profession. I'm a young Doctor and I wanted to do this course during university.
502,Perfect into course! Thanks a lot!
503,Very excellent mood lessons and great interesting and enjoying studying process.
504,great course
505,Very interesting the way the video are made.
506,"I am 3 weeks into the course and can categorically say that it one of the best courses I have ever taken. Besides the professor's implacable knowledge, his amazing command over fluid teaching is admirable. I really like the content where the earners are taught how to dissect (and construct) an argument for a broad range of areas where they might find its use.People who are thinking of taking it, make sure you commit at least 5 hours every week. Absorb and enjoy!"
507,Very very good and interesting course
508,Great for doing consumer and customer research.
509,Fool
510,Very useful you
511,Everything is great! Sometimes lectures were apart from seminary and laws
512,Awesome content. I'm happy with the results.
513,"Very information, well-paced and objective course. Even more beneficial as it is the sole comprehensive course on the subject in the internet."
514,Very good course taking into consideration the first week
515,"His course is a MUST- of !! it helped me , i was more organised , less forgetful and better prepared..highly recommended!!!"
516,His is a course for anyone who wants to be able to think logical. Is an of professional I would recommend this course to my colleagues in the Information Technology field.
517,Great training about preparing nutricious foods for kiss.
518,A very inspiring course
519,"Lectures were extremely good, but assignment and traders were very low quality and difficult to decipher requirements from. Professors and was were not active in the forms."
520,Excellent course! I've already learned so much! The tutors are brilliant - Thanks!
521,I like the course very much! and I like May and her recipe!
522,A highly information module giving you an overview of the scientific methods used in studying terrorist and counterterrorism.
523,"love this class, very pleasant instructor lectures and good into"
524,The assignment give very nice practice.
525,He tried to use this class to teach a brown bag lunch for our employees interested in programming. Python is a great language but this class has a very low content to volume ratio (nobody wants to watch the instructor meet his life-time idol at a trade-show or watch the Until versus AMD melt-down commercial over their lunch break).
526,"Terrific. Of I could rate this ZERO I would. The instructor will give you a one sentence explanation and definition for a term (literally, I download the transcripts to help with my notes and assignment) and then say, ""Now that we learned x..."" and fly right into the next term. Horse, many of the sentences don't even make sense and completely incoherent, even in the written transcribe. I am having to go out and find additional textbook to research the basic definitions of what is required to pass the course. There is even less explanation of real-world applications, examples, and demonstration. It is almost as though she tried to memories a sheet of definitions and repeated them without the use of her notes. His results in a highly monotonous monologue with awkward gestures and little actual content. I was planning on going for the of for Digital Media Mortification, but I can't handle another course like this. It's a waste of time and money."
527,"Excellent tutors and material.I am 59 years old now and wish I had known this stuff when I was at school and before I decided to go into further education,at the age of 30. I would have even got a better grade than I did for my degree. I think this course should be part of any school's / college curriculum Thank you."
528,Great course and awesome instructor.
529,"Very good class, professor is very entertaining. Concepts take into account the latest & greatest of HTML & of. In general, i think a price of $79 is too high for a MOOC class of 3 weeks duration"
530,A good course to set up your software tool kit before you start your dive into Data Science Specialization
531,A very deep thinking course and I am really enjoying it. It has really defeated the thought about negotiation being argumentative.
532,Great Course for software professional who already know other languages like Cava and wants to learn of
533,"I was very enthusiastic to follow this inspiring course delivered by the prestigious University of London (Birkbeck) about “Now to Manage People at work”.Or. Chris Dewberry, Lecturer and Course Director did an absolute and fantastic job by presenting this course and sharing recommendable & actionable strategics.His course isn’t solitary for going earners seeking to add or master their managerial position, but its also advocated for employee(s) searching better work environment and performance by understanding the of theories, policies and procedures.By understanding their views and Performance Management strategics, any employee(s) will positively benefits the outcome of this outstanding course.I really loved the different video’s involving actors, showcasing different scenario’s/situations of well-known work cases.The video recording and of production, is very well prepared!I was highly impressed by the excellent teaching sessions from Watering Anna (Reaching numbers of of related nodules for the University of London's Human Resource Management Program provided by Birkbeck).Last but not least, I was wonderfully impressed by the charismatic Or. Juliet Vassar advice and strategics. (lecturer in Occupational Health Psychology and Deputy Director of the Enter for Sustainable Working Life at Birkbeck College, University of London).His is an unconditional cellar course and; unquestionably deserve a lawless 5 star rating!!!!!"
534,"started quite good, but slow video and the last quit was about just numbers. it is good to know what are the measurement, but if we won't teach about that too, the more concrete information and not numbers would be more information and useful."
535,"Covers the essential machine learning concepts and common algorithms. Is a bonus, you learn to work with Active."
536,"Lots of great material. A good place to start for those new to sinfulness and an opportunity to broaden and deepen one's practice for more long-term practitioner. A variety of religious and secular perspective are covered, both current and historical, with a view toward ethics and practical application. The perspective presented is unbiased and encourages independent thinking, self-analysis and reflection. It was well worth the time I invested and I intend to continue referring back to the notes I have made as well as the resources that have been provided throughout the course. I look forward to more from Prof. Soto-Bones in this area!"
537,Very good course for beginners without programming background. You will be able to learn many fundamental topics that you need to know in order to be a good and efficient programme.
538,His course has two great projects .A simulated MIP track and a Physical lab track in which we will make a Over.Of you are ambitious you can even implement slam on the of track.of track is on raspberry pie and the stimulation track is on matas.His course will give you the basis for a robotics career I believe.
539,Really easy and useful. Thank you very much
540,"Outstanding quality of the professors, really pedagogically and attractive classes (not a display of presentations, this is eye-to-eye- kind of presence), comprehensive but extremely compared information, comprehensive bibliography that includes all the topic treated or barely mentioned. It's an enjoyable trip to the concept of magic and the social understanding of that word, in the Middle Ages thought the eyes of Catholic, Jewish and Osteo-Scientists of the period."
541,Totally beneficial!
542,Pollen is a great teacher!
543,"gets way too in-depth with the path behind repression, to the point that it deter from the learning process. was hoping to learn better methods of interpreting or enacting repression, not the inner workings of the algorithms.assignment got overlay complex with confusing instructions. there are definitely some leaps made in the assumptions of what students' patron capabilities are. vague instructions caused more frustration than desire to continue learning.will continue in the specialization, but will not hesitate to drop out if instruction continues like this.very disappointed."
544,Great introduction to Python!
545,"Well presented, practical, and hands-on. By far the best Data Science / Machine Learning series I have taken thus far on Coursera."
546,His course is interesting and full of challenge. Teachers are great and enthusiastic.
547,"Though not too inclusive, it's a great course for introduction."
548,"Assignment are really very useful,and the video are clearly understandable it can be of more depth"
549,"Excellent course, touch some very basic requirements for successful negotiations. An be useful for both new in career to well experienced like me."
550,"I loved it. I learned a ton about making games and I learned it by doing it. To, I have two games and a media stimulation to show for it.Unity was covered. However, Of modeling, illustration, and audit were not really taught (but a little bit, in theory.) I think it somewhat has to be like this, unfortunately. For me, I used Slender, Photoshop, and Fruit Loops to create my asset, but mostly just the game development is handled in this course. I'm only saying this, because you should know this front, really, which I didn't.Looking forward to the next class..."
551,Very nice theory and very useful practical case with all advises that help to get the best results! Appreciate everyone from UCI and Margaret for this chance to master Project Management!
552,Good introduction!
553,"Assignment are good-intended, but I am not sure how helpful they are, as they are really boring and unnecessarily time-consuming. I do not know how could one make them better. In contrast, the video are really good, they are worth your time even if you know your way around these things."
554,"It was fun, engaging and education. Good instructor. she did so great."
555,"Good foundation in the Data Science Mortification for Practical Machine Learning. There are 3 areas that I would like to dig deeper so far: Statistical Inference, Depression Models and Practical Machine Learning (perhaps + Deep Learning)."
556,Very good house to keep me update.
557,"I am really not sure if you need 20-30 minutes video to explain the material - I think maybe 7-10 minutes clear with some good examples would be more helpful, I fell sleep during some of the lectures, boring, long and not sure if necessary - on the other hand I guess 20-30 minutes is good because you learn to put up with arguments and clear them up yourself - also maybe this course was directed towards high school students thus the long explanations -Overall, as I said on the beginning, it would work better with clear definitions and some examples and discussion board -"
558,"Easy to understand, a simple guide that really orient me"
559,A good foundation for Python development.
560,"The content is just amazing, and the teachers are so awesome prompted me to do more courses from UCSD"
561,"Excellent course, very well organized and the teacher is really direct and clear, which made it much more effective!"
562,excellent ! ! ! very useful information and guideline.
563,"It's a great course. It is very well structures and provides a foundation of research and I am glad that it is a part of Interaction Design specialization. However, might be extremely challenging for people without Statistics experience."
564,amazing course
565,I looked into the course because I'm an Colony and Evolutionary Biology student that got into Evolutionary Same Theory. I wanted a more basic and fundamental understanding of game theory. Really good lectures - I particularly think the examples/applications are interesting.
566,Both the specialization and the course are top quality. Professor Muppala is the best!
567,I really enjoyed the course. Professor is very clear and schematic and really passionate on the topic. The studying material is very organized. One improvement could be inserting another week-module in order to slowdown a bit the lecture pace.
568,very helpful and intriguing course. Is. Valley is a nice and knowlegable lady. she gives me tools and confidence to broaden my scope of learning. very very much appreciate
569,That's great! His course is very interesting and helpful. There are many technique to help you learn more effectively.

571,Great Course I like it a lot. I learn new things for my research
572,"Excellent course. It made me not only get a better understanding on topics i've seen scarcely prior, but also contributed to a solid theoretical basis in the field of clinical trials. Special attention to the first week of the course should be given, since it provides one of the best explanations about study design i've seen so far."
573,Generally it helps but I hope it would be much better if you have chances to review resume from each other and receive feedback. Thank you.
574,It's a great addition to the book. His course would perfectly feet those who're completely new to programming.
575,good course
576,Helped me understand why my left my family for a life of met addition. I am thankful that it has reduced my stress and anger over what she has done. even a small amount of understanding
577,THE BEST EVER COURSE of PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT

583,"Very helpful, thank you, Prof. G!"
584,"Moved the course, and the way the teachers taught! Learnt a lot of new things!"
585,"Course lacks wider and real soil-political context of the XIX and of century Central and Eastern Europe. Additionally, it is full of statements that are not supported by the historical facts."
586,REALLY GOOD STUFF FOR BEGINNERS of of AREA. A LOT of THANKS FOR of.ANDREW!!
587,The course is practical and very useful. The instructor are amazing. I strongly recommend it . Thank you Bocconi and Coursera.
588,I really loved this course. I recommend it for anyone who aims to achieve their goal
589,"Excellent class, and an even better interface now that it changed to always available.Prof. Door explains with such clarity that even a 5 year old can learn about DNA.His is my and time taking this class, and I've seen already many positive changes in this st week alone.Thank you Coursera, Duke University, all participants in general, and a very special thank you to Prof. Door, your contagious love for science spreads like wild fire."
590,its one of the most powerful and skillful course for data scientist
591,Almost perfect for beginners. There are some stitches in some assignment but I hope that they will be fixed.
592,I've learnt a lot from it! =) Thank you for creating opportunities for all ESL students and teachers!
593,"Typical question of novice of programming: That language should I learn first?Typical answer is incorrect, sadly.Correct answer is: It doesn't matter. Algorithms and patterns matters. I'm not sure about patterns, but Donald South and Robert Sedgwick are best at algorithms. And here you have unique possibility to learn from the best. Rush for it! And be prepared, it won't be easy.And many thanks to Even Hayne for his fundamental job. Probably he is the one who we should thank for this great opportunity to learn it here, on course."
594,"Its been a great experience attending the course, one stop for knowing the basis of of. Looking eagerly to deep dive in the coming courses of this Specialization. Thank YOU !!"
595,good for engineers....but needs some more projects to be explained
596,His course is an excellent platform to know the basis of fraud and the mode of operation of tit will help you to do better in your career
597,"Very good compare to what the courses in Nicaragua are like. Perhaps the bad point are the examples that the professor use, many of then are not so realistic. When learning about a situation that conditional our strategy, we must also know what others input take part too."
598,"Professor Right did an outstanding job of presenting the fundamental principles of Buddhist and Evolutionary Psychology in a manner that a newcomer to these discipline can understand. By greatest take away from the course will be further exploration of these ideas through the varied and rich resources he provided. By personal favorites were Bikkhu Tophi, Hudson Brewer and Joseph Goldstein.Thank you Professor Right"
599,"It was a great course, i learned the mean aspects about terrorist and counter terrorist. I think the methodology used was essential to have more interest on the topics handled.I recommend it!"
600,Helped me get a grip on time at work....
601,I am very thankful for this class. I had been struggling to find a way to start learning programming and what language would be ideal to begin with.
602,A very good course. It gives a very good insight into the finance required for start-up. His course is a must for all the future entrepreneurs.
603,not of a worth
604,"There are issues with submitting assignment (failure to process submission in Coursera).Beer reviews may not be the best solution, as we have to wait a long time for our work to be reviewed!"
605,The Mechanics of Materials course series is a must for any engineer. The material is presented in a logical and straight forward manner with applications to the real world. Or. Whitman is truly a a great teaching Professor!
606,Very Fool
607,"Great course for learning patron, still use it as a reference"
608,Very good class!
609,"I took this class to fulfill a prerequisite for my graduate program, and it was outstanding -- easily the best online class I have taken to date. The professor is enthusiastic and explain things very well. Not only is the material broken into manageable chinks, but the supporting exercises and textbook are really helpful too. I highly recommend it."
610,I'm in the first week but I find it to be fun and very information. Everything has been explained in great detail. Very happy for this introductory class. Thank you.
611,His course was very well communicated and enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it to others looking for a beginning course in machine learning.
612,His course is easy but useful!
613,"I suggest to do this course ONLY if you're doing whole specialization.Course is simply bad, teacher doesn't give to much information and project is very hard to finish."
614,"Excellent course, very well explained by Andrew G! :) Any, many thanks to Andrew G and all the other that contributed to that course! :)"
615,"Very good, well structures and trading by peers is a good one"
616,Very Straight forward and explicit.
617,Amazing course!
618,One of the best courses on Machine Learning by one of the most luminaries in the space of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (Andrew of).
619,"It was great pleasure to pass through this course. Each lecture week had found new horizons and connections among surrounding data, mathematics apparatus and machine learning mechanics. The materials are very coherent and carefully prepared. Thanks to Andrew and his helping collaborators for this opportunity))"
620,Very useful!Looking forward to the further course!of 기대합니다！
621,Very interesting materials! Love this course!

623,It is full and dynamic.
624,His course is really good. I came at it thinking I know English well and do not need to be taught like I'm a first grade. But I'm learning more about entrepreneurship. It is fantastic.
625,"Professor is very powerful, various experiments done fast. Professor of teaching I have never seen before, he was led to my interest in learning, so I easily learned over the course."
626,Very insightful. Likely one of the best courses on Coursera.
627,"Awesome, fabulous!"
628,"3 weeks was a bit of a rush to get everything done, but the course was very information and met expectations."

630,"It was a great learning experience. Would love to do more such courses, if with any specialization in oncology field."
631,"easy to understand material covering almost every basic things you need to know about html, iss and javascript"
632,His course was so convoluted and not practical that it made me lose complete interest in the specialization.
633,"Besides the course free fee, the content is meaningful and worth studying. Thanks."
634,Excellent..teachers are very enthusiastic about teaching which is helpful when learning.
635,Great video lessons and extra reading material to expand concepts and ideas. The course has also very good rhythm and short tests at the end of each lesson are great to understand the important points of the course.
636,Perfect a life changing course.
637,The Course is designed so well by the of Davis and Coursera. And the discussion forum is also really helpful for me while studying this course. It's really a great experience.

639,very helpful course; introduces the basic concept in Global health and I start to become more interested in it!
640,Its a very good course to start learning for data analysis which can work as a foundation to learn more in data science and machine learning.
641,Very information and nicely presented.
642,"Sometimes too easy, but may be good as a start point. Video lessons are long for the amount of the shared information."
643,Vice introduction to essay writing. It gives several tips and examples.
644,Great introduction to Fig Data concepts and MapReduce
645,Very animated and enthusiastic instructor. Providing the lecture sides was very helpful.
646,"His course is divided into 4 weeks. The first two weeks are about CSS and HTML. I started this course as a beginner and was able to keep up with it for the first two weeks. Week three material isn't explained at all and for a beginner, it is very difficult. I wouldn't recommend this course to a beginner at all. That i did like about the course was that the material is organized but that doesn help if you dont understand what is being taught. I dropped out of this course at week 3. Good Luck."
647,Splendid! Leading towards Capstone!
648,Great course for a guitar beginner!
649,Really Helpful. The way they've explained stuff with such ease makes it totally worth it.
650,Wonderful and clearly explained
651,Good information and great instructor.
652,"Thank you Air Thomas H. Wanders, Or., for this vital and information sessions, all thing is compel so nicely."

654,It is a very nice course :) you can learn a lot from it
655,"His course is a sufficient way to improve your capacity of being yourself by improving your relationships with other and let positive and negative emotions too,be embodied and not just abandon them.His course will help you total find yourown way to cope with stress and anxiety and will give you advice on how your immune and your cardiovascular system will flourish by experiencing emotions as they come to us."
656,The last module felt like I really had to apply my brain here!
657,Great course
658,A great and exciting start for the Specialization
659,In inspiring introduction to game theory!!!
660,His course combined basic statistics knowledge and practical R skill well.
661,Vice Course with Vice Asks.
662,Studio on video was sometimes unclear. Course content was interesting.
663,"Questions in examination can be taken from a pool of 20, may be 30 every time but not the exact 10 always.Since all questions have maximum of 2 option, if it is wrong, for the next attempt other answer is true definitely."
664,"Thanks teacher.His course is good enough for me to start my own business now.Hopefully,you can get my invitation to visit my company the few years.Thank"
665,"I'm an international business management student here in Brazil, and this course helped me a lot to come up with arguments for my presentations, I loved the topics discussed along the course, highly recommended, thank you so much!!!"
666,"I united this course. Had I been more serious on the music side, I would have done the specialization or completion certificate. The video were great breakdown of effects common to most DAWs. The walk through of using the effects made me more comfortable with exploring different settings other than what is in the default."
667,"Interesting course, good lecturer, but sides have too much text so it was a bit difficult to follow."
668,"His course helped me develop a good understanding of complex machine learning concepts.The tools were easy to use and helped me learn quickly. Unlike other programming classes I've tried in Coursera, I did not have to deal with programming environment related problems. I learnt important patron skill also."
669,"Very Optimum for a complete beginner, covering everything from the start.Recommended for people who wants to know everything about web development before they actually get into the coming part and start making their won webster."
670,"His is not a business course. Explaining what an email is, and how to send attachments is completely irrelevant information.The title of the course should be more appropriate - Introduction to email, what is it and how to use it. Or something that gives people the idea that the course is about very basic information about email."
671,Awesome course!!!!
672,Coursework was quite easy. Used a lot of the technique learned in the other courses. You'll get the most out of this course if you have a data analysis project that you want to do. For us this wasn't required. But doing my own project was the most fun part :)
673,"The basic principles of design and their philosophies were covered well in this course, and it was taught in a quick, efficient manner. I liked undergoing this course and would recommend it."
674,Great and valuable course!
675,The need update the homework
676,Listening to weeks lecture..I feel Andrew has demystified machine learning and made it more accessible to people who are eager to learn the subject.
677,"The instructor approach in this course is very nursery. He tries to split the difference in going through the mechanics/mathematical theory and practical applications. Is a result, he fails at both. I think it would be better to leave the mathematics and application learning to supporting materials and focus on explaining the theory and concepts of statistical inference in the lectures."
678,Is for non-native English speaker and programme amateur this course is literally a godson! Thank you!
679,Beautiful course. City that in our university do not teach like here.
680,Very good. It was challenging.
681,I learned a lot. I've been using it with dancing and learning academic. Thank you.
682,of INTERESTING AND FUN. Have you ever took a stranger'S secret and propose another stranger to take that secret in exchange of one of his? His course is an opportunity to do crazy stuff like that!
683,"I love the way this class was structures with short video and reading - the concepts were clearly articulated and easier to absorb in this format. I found the content interesting and very relevant to my work in education, health promotion, and development."
684,Excellent course. I'm a current master's student and this course was essential to my understanding of Master GIS. A must for the GIS-tormented professional!
685,"Simple and so useful tools that you can use for any subjects and helps you any some many aspects in life. Short, well done, engaging. Thank you for it"
686,"Great contents, depth is also great."
687,Great!
688,Examples would help distinguish the glances between the processes for example the use of the Microsoft daily build. Great comprehensive course otherwise.
689,"It's amazing what u can learn in a month ! , than for such a great course , than for proof, Pollen ! and Am really happy ."
690,great course
691,"Not very in-depth, but I don't think it was really meant to be. Good starting off point to see if you like this kind of thing, and it's helped me understand the important concepts behind public health."
692,awesome course!
693,Challenging course with huge payoff in new skill gained!!!
694,May too technical for a beginner...
695,"Outstanding, really helpful- the lecturer's are great!"
696,"These courses on Ancient Life Evolution are best when they discuss how species developed, how they adapted and how they were discovered. The sundry listing of species in some of the lectures was a ooze felt however. It also repeated what was in other lectures for the week. I would have preferred more information on the ecosystem in which the writers swelled. The Ancient Marine Reptile class did a much better job of presenting this into although it did some sundry listing."
697,"It is one of the most useful course from Course, and it significantly help me improve my business English skill."
698,Great and valuable teachings!
699,Awesome course for begginers like me for create from scratch my sounds in my virtual synthesizers.Thanks so much Coursera and Berklee Online!
700,"It's not my first time to take a beginners course in Chinese so I already know some of the words and phrases, but this course was a good refreshed course, too. The lessons were short and easy to remember. I think the expressions taught were also very practical. I hope there is a second part so I can continue my lessons in Chinese. Lie lie!"
701,"Interesting topic, maybe an improvement could be to provide the material as one file and not many files one for each video (also easier to consult in the future)."
702,"I felt it was mainly fun, and I did talked about the principles and interviews I've seen during the course, so I guess something about the course works! :)Also, It helped me understand some of my behavior (for good and bad) .There are a few things that were a bit...well...made me go somewhere else for a while during the course:1.It took me a while to get used to the lectures temps. For me - they are a bit too slow.2.In many cases - the answers for the question were long. From time to time - It was really exhausting."
703,"Course material was not difficult, but the homework weren't much corrected with it. Of you attend other of online courses you will notice that this one is a little old fashioned. I was also more interested in real-life usage than how it should be implements. Regardless the sons course was information and somehow useful."
704,"Great as an introduction for many things but, unfortunately, it is not possible to keep on developing the themes presented on the lectures because there is no access to the sources used. Without a functional bibliography for the course, the full potential for learning of those enrolled is radically cut."
705,Wonderful course with excellent explanation
706,"Clear, information, well structures."
707,great time to bethink about the future and interact with many people who have different perspective
708,His is a very helpful course.
709,It is the best course from the best instructor
710,"The instructor Andrew of is very good with his material and his explanation methods, but the course does not delve much into the details of the methods. By expectation of the course was that it would explain the core mathematics behind the scenes."
711,It's really helpful!
712,"Professor Part is a really good teacher. Take this course and you will see. I have studied sociology at University of To Fault, the biggest and the ""best"" university of Latin America (according to international banking), since 2009. However, during all this time I never found a Professor like him."
713,"I learned quite a lot about the correlation between the brain and the process of learning. His is a very good course. Most importantly, teachers do well in communicating and conveying their ideas and thoughts to earners."
714,"I really enjoyed this course, The only thing I would have liked to have learned more about was how to do Same Design Documents and how they are made. I would have liked to have seen more examples as well as how to do these examples as well.Thank you, I learned a lot.Sarah Prewitt"
715,"It is a clear and simply course about how to write an essay. I did not know too much about writing before I take it, but now I feel confident to write a good essay."
716,His is one really helpful course for marketing analysis.
717,"Very Great and Exciting Course with Sides !!! I learned a lot about Transportation Nodes, Warehousing and Building a Logistics Network in USA."
718,"The teacher was very clear and gave information at a nice, comfortable pace. I really liked the format of the class: vocabulary and grammar structures, dialogue, short quit, and extra practice. The way she made distinctions between correct and incorrect pronunciation of certain ilyin combinations was really helpful, too. Excellent and enjoyable course!"
719,A very interesting course
720,Thank you for giving me excellent information on oil & gas industry operations.It is very helpful course for me. Thank you Duke university and course.
721,"Like it, very interesting and useful !!! Thanks a lot"
722,Awesome Enter and Course outline.
723,Excellent course. Very education should take it.
724,"Or. Charles ""Chuck"" Russell Severance is an amazing professor, thankful to Coursera that i could learn from a Legend. I am looking forward to complete all other courses."
725,Course should be more interactive and details
726,"I thought this would be a fun simple class, but I DID NOT know anything about marine reptile, and it showed. I learned a lot and this instruction was very helpful and very educational."
727,pretty challenging. Compact delivery.
728,Very useful
729,His course is an excellent introduction to basic programming and to patron. I recommend it for everyone that never programme before.
730,I really liked this course! I learned a lot about ruby and the way the professor teach us is really great! It's not annoying like other video or books for those who doesn't like to read too much (like me) Amazing job! thanks you for everything
731,Absolutely cool Course!
732,"Or. Douglas, you are a very excellent instructor; my pleasure to learn from you. Congratulations!"
733,"Although I've been reading some official/unofficial materials about Machine Learning, I really found that this course is very helpful to help me figure out some very practical tips in doing actual development."
734,They say that if you don't have anything good to say it's better not to say anything at all.
735,His course is very important and useful. I learnt a lot for my future experience.Thanks a lot for course! !!
736,"His course is easy to follow with a mix of resources making it engaging and inspiring. I found the RAPID PFA model to be an effective and practice response to dealing with adverse situations. It is very interesting to learn that this technique is found to be more effective than that of a series of post disaster psychotherapy, so this can be taught to non medical aid workers and possibly alleviate some of the sometimes unnecessary strain on medical and/or psychological resources. It is all about going back to basis, a need to reach out to others and a need to communicate and not suffer in silence."
737,"Must watched the first week and I am already excited about it! Please, I BEG YOU, make the Trophic design specialization! :)"
738,His course helped me to learn about the data structures of patron and everything was explained by the professor very nicely. Thank You to Professor and the entire course team for so much efforts.
739,Very interesting course. The virtual reconstruction work was new.
740,"I didn't expect too much, but I was wrong!"
741,"I learned a lot of new things throughout this course. It first, my skeptically approach was: ""well that I've seen on YouTube"", but after st week I started realizing it gives you more - the understanding of how games made, what it takes and what you're capable of when left with limited knowledge and some ready-to-use tools. His month wasn't that easy for me and what I know for sure - if not for college-like system and approach - I would've put studies away to solve life problems, which would probably result in putting it away for longer."
742,Seemed like a great course for beginning programming!
743,Wonderful course.I took it just to satisfy my curiosity. I really enjoyed listening to the lectures and doing the quires. Any thanks to the professor for taking the time to make it.I would be happy to see a more advanced version.
744,I enjoyed the course as it highlight many strategics and insight into making effective visualizations. It makes good use to Tableaux and gives practical examples. The only thing I would like to see added is a simple instruction manual to accomplish some of the methods they employed. Overall I think it was great to have this as a second course in the series because it lays the foundation for good design practices.
745,Great course - really insightful
746,Excellent and very intuition.
747,Very common of knowledge and less deeper knowledge than expected. It's an high level introduction but definitely no specialisation.Only the LTE part is much better and in more detail right now.To. I don't like presentations with reading only the visible content. He all can read by our self. More spoken details between the lines would be nice.
748,Very nice & competent ... despite the Eddy addition :-D :-D :-D
749,"Informative and well presented, but honestly you need to make the core reading available online, as it makes it really difficult to possibly get the most out of this course. I live in a remote part of Australia where are no universities or public libraries which would have a copy of the book by Calhoun, and even if I had been able to afford the book it would have taken 6 weeks or more to get to me. To I read the alternative reading but it clearly wasn't enough to get the quit questions right which were obviously extracted directly from content of the Calhoun book. Of it isn't possible to make sections of this book available online then you should at least write some of the quit questions so that they are accessible to students who can't get hold of a copy of the book."
750,great course but wish to have more materials or explanation on sad and PCA part.
751,These are clearly well designed and structures essential basis in epidemiology.
752,"The instructor and the contents are great, but the assignment are not challenging."
753,I found significant improvement of my grammar after having attended.
754,"very well, structure, the quit was admirably hard, but satisfying to work through and solve. you made me think outside the box, excellent"
755,High quality course with professional and friendly instructor.
756,Not very engaging. I ended up just reading the notes as video were slow and took too much time. Not enough pathophysiology or treatment details for me as a healthcare provider. Disappointed after taking a previous course which was wonderful...student conversations and dialogue from around the world.
757,"Good content, the quit questions with free-form text input could do with some improvement/guidance."
758,"The course is great! Everything is well explained, a lot of example, good sense of humor and really cool and adequate exercises to implement what is least, I highly recommended for anyone who wants to get the basis (maybe even more) of web development."
759,"Now this course might seem small but it is not, the test are really challenging and the knowledge of video lectures aren't enough, you have to dig deep and study from other sources too. The situations in the test and exercises are cool and fun way to learn. I will highly recommend anyone who is interested in cosmology to take this course but be prepared the ocean is not that calm as it seems.Happy learning."
760,"It could have a course for learning Chinese in letters, But still free and will buy a certificate."
761,"Great course! I found it extremely helpful that the 'why and why not' as well as the 'what happens behind the scene in Angular' was also addressed. Furthermore, the practical application in the last week was very helpful to breach the gap between isolated tasks and a real world problem."
762,Excellent course. 100% useful to teachers. By life has changed immensely after studying this course.
763,I really enjoyed this course! I really liked the video of the instructor taking apart the model brain and pointing out the different parts and their functions.
764,His is an excellent course as an introduction to language teaching. Moved how the entire course was scaffold and built upon very important language teaching technique. I highly recommend this course for those interested in becoming a TESOL Instructor or as a review for teachers who are already teaching. I am very satisfied!!
765,"It is really a lovely course! One point, among many others, that really amazed me is the geometric explanation of ridge and also! For me, I think the course would be better if the content can be more mathematically challenging but it is only a suggestion and the course is already quite perfect."
766,The session was really interesting and proved to be very useful to me.
767,Great course and great content! I really recommend it for those wanting to learn key aspect of the language for management and leadership.
768,Very nice course. Strongly recommend for machine learning beginners like me.
769,"Really useful to understand and know other people and oneself better, very important to put into practice the whole theory of motivation, leadership, groups and culture, in the daily family and professional relationships, in special because we are persons (body, intelligence and heart), sometimes not easy to manage if we can't understand."
770,Very interesting and innovative course
771,To exciting courseThank you very!
772,"Complete and very useful course, great teacher.In curse may til y necesario, excellent professor."
773,"His class taught me a lot about the basis of typography, however I didn't feel too encouraged relatively compared to the last class in this series. I understand that type is a bit more structures and requires more attention to detail and rules than other forms of visual art, but I wish there was a bit more content similar to the content in week 4 where we are encouraged to get creative."
774,its a very good course.its very helpful course.
775,"Completely worth the time I invested in this course. Clear and to the point instruction with practical assignment. I feel I really learned something through this. It was my first experience with Coursera, thanks to Or. Charles and the support team of senators and classmates.I ended up purchasing the mortification and am continuing my studies with Coursera."
776,Basic Python Knowledge for everyone. It's easy and fun.
777,Really helpful and well-structures. The Professor was very communicative!
778,Thank you!Course instruction was clear and home work was challenging enough to make me have to listen ;-)
779,"It's a great course for patron learning, thanks ."
780,Valley (with support from other researches) provides some handy study tools in this healthy guide to good study habits. The lectures are accessible to any learning level---middle-schools to graduate students. The lectures and quires reinforce material from her book. Highly recommended for everybody who wants to get the most out of their study time.
781,cool cool cool
782,Audible the Creative Commons approach and the material was quite all right. Deep up the wonderful job!
783,in only the first week of the course i learned several new concepts .
784,West Course I have taken! Course is well organized and doesn't get boring. Would recommend!

786,Or. Chuck is the best
787,"Awesome! I am in the th week of this course but would like it to go on & on.... Now subtly & effectively Prof. Raghunathan shows us what we do and how effectively & scientifically we can make changes in our life, approach to lead much better life - to be really happy & fulfilled. Only saying, Great work! would be too little.Thanks so much!"
788,"By search for a ""good understanding of SEO process"" was over after this course..! Now I'm daring to get more.. thanks!"
789,Very interesting approach for begginers.
790,Easy and well-structures course for those who want to begin exploring how food affects our health and what and how to eat to live a longer and happier life. Those who are already interested in the topic might find the course very basic. Most of examples are about so called Western diet and American eating habits so it might be less relevant for some other countries.
791,"Well paced, well explained. A bit of issues with the grade th; it appeared I had proper santa but was getting errors."
792,Good course for any dog lover to take.
793,"Great introduction course. It doesn't take too much commitment either, so getting it done will motivate you fore further learning!"
794,I want to give 4 stars because this course reaches you many concepts in a short time. In a very understandable way.
795,"The initial topics and concepts are very well explained, which helps to build a solid foundation for learning future advanced programming technique. Prof. Charles has taken time to elaborate on basis which can be easily grasped by complete beginners. The language and pace of course is easy and the lessons are peppered with lot of examples and video interviews of industry experts."
796,"Thank you Coursera. I'm really happy to have a course with Berklee, I'll keep going to learn more at ."
797,THE COURSE CONTAIN CONTENTS THAT ARE PRACTICABLE AND THOROUGHLY RESEARCH. THANK YOU. I HOPE of APPLY FOR A CERTIFICATE SOON.
798,"The course is extremely good!To point out,the information is necessary in real life,in real life content!"
799,"His was my first Coursera course. I liked how this course was organized. The video, quires and assignment were very well designed to get a grasp of Machine Learning. I am really grateful to Andrew G and team for putting the effort to create this class and this platform of learning. Thank you!"
800,just loving it. i will be waiting to take tests. very useful. Thank you for giving such a nice opportunity to learn from Michigan University.
801,"Great Course, it`s very important for my study"
802,"Basic, but good."
803,"Emily Box did a great job in explaining tough concepts with simple explanation of the components in the formula!!It's a little tough to get through the materials though, it's the th course in University of Washington's machine learning specialization afterall =)"
804,"Very information, detailed, and straight to the point. Wonderful class."
805,Very information and easy to understand instructor.
806,"The course has given a strong understanding of how the drug discovery process works with expert presentations by Or. Williams Ettouati, Or. Course & Or. Stephen Surely. Thanks to Knaggs School of Pharmacy and course to Coursera for making it possible."
807,The video gave really good explanations.
808,this course will definitely change how you approach business i highly recommend it.
809,"i learn here how to learn....really fabulous ,method of teaching ...i like both teachers and their way of speaking...i like course contents i.e. they are really arranged in professional manner....thank you DUKE university and its teachers for giving me such a important platform for learning........."
810,"The teacher is very comprehensive and very serious. I saw the power of Peter while I was staring to learnNode.is, thanks."
811,One of the best courses I have taken so far.
812,"I find it very practical. Not only do the lectures give you general overview of the concepts with examples, but also they teach you how to do the baths which is very important in my opinions. Thank you very much Prof. Anger and the team."
813,It's good to understand the way our brain works when we're learning and how to turn it.
814,His is a great course to get a basic foundation of bone plot technique and fundamental control theory in relation to power converted design.
815,really helpful : )
816,"Thank you for an excellent class, Professor Bloomfield! I would suggest having a term glossy tossed up somewhere."
817,"Excellent course, packed full of information - A MUST for anyone who is learning the Cava programming language. Lots of effort has gone into this course and is very well structures clearly defining topics week by week."
818,"the course is great! i've studied economics so i dont have any knowledge in law subjects,however i manage not only to learn about legal situations but also to understand how it works in several countries."
819,some experience by this course.
820,"Great class for expanding your GIS foundation skill. Learn to create and edit features; determine slope, elevation, and distance; unload your content to ArcGIS web maps."
821,One of the best courses ever!
822,Great into to Python!!
823,The information presented and assignment required are immediately beneficial and help teachers with a variety of style develop their own system of organizing themselves.
824,"the instructor is really harsh, don't pass him off!"
825,Relevant information for teachers. His course has caused me to reflect on prior understanding of learning
826,That a wonderful course!!
827,Simple and inspired me to take another course from Coursera !
828,I really love this course! It helps me to find a lot of answers which disturbed me and to understand Art better! Highly recommend!
829,Very useful learning tips and tricks.
830,I really enjoyed the course. The professor was very down to earth.
831,"Good explanations, easy to understand"
832,"The course is excellent for beginners who already have a basic knowledge of music theory. The course is a great way to build on that knowledge. I play guitar, but this course was just as applicable to non-piano players. Thank you, great job."
833,Great Course by Great University and best Teacher
834,"Interesting, but some assignment needs to be double checked. In my opinion some of the presented material is teaching poor coming practices for the sake of simplicity."
835,The Good:Very palpable content and provides information at a very slow pace for ease of learning.More reasonable content and far more worthwhile than the first Arduino course of the series.The Had:Not worth the money when looked at generally. The first and second course could easily have been merged. A lack of introduction to electronic circuits also hinders full use of what is being taught.
836,Great class and great set of classes. Or. Chuck does an awesome job of clearly conveying concepts that stick with you. I have already used the content I've learned to perform some the associated tasks of my job better and faster.
837,I got useful knowledge from this course.
838,The instructor does a fascinating job of structuring and delivering the course material. The concepts are simplifies and well explained with the help of practical applications and relevance.
839,"Clear explanations of the concepts of statistics, without too much emphasis on the formula. With handy references to online tools, like power calculations."
840,West MOOC in my mind! Easy to learn regardless of background. I really enjoy it and learnt a lot.
841,"Great course, I've learned a lot of networking, the course reaches the basic stuff of internet and it is a good way to start this. I recommend this course to anyone who has a little experience of this, I want to clarify some information like layers, for example."
842,His course is really relevant in today's education system most especially K-12.
843,In exceptionally outstanding course!
844,very information
845,The machine learning methods introduced in this course are very powerful. And the course was taught in a way that's easier to understand.
846,Please let the grade assignment to the financially poor candidate as well.
847,Very information! Professor Ormstein makes the topics easy to understand & interesting despite little knowledge on environmental law.
848,Sides kept cutting out either entirely or the sound would cut out. Made it very difficult to follow.
849,Excellent introduction to guitar. Well presented practical instruction with good advice regarding practice and further development.
850,A lot of objective approaches for monitoring and improving projects!
851,anyone will definitely learn something
852,Great Course! I got to learn a lot. Very useful content.
853,"I appreciate the way Emily and Parlor explain the concepts. Its very intuition for beginners and optional sections give further details. The datasets used in programming assignment are taken from real world examples.Overall an excellent course and really looking forward to completing the series.Buds to Parlor, Emily and the team."
854,"His was an amazing Course! it was really difficult choosing the best teacher, because each had their unique way of fearlessly importing knowledge. i learned a lot from this course and a few life lessons too. i have become a better of person from this course."
855,I have learned so much and I love D's energy and the aid participation of the other students. Will definitely pass on what I've learned. An't wait for more courses like this in the future! :)
856,One of the best
857,"a bit too easy, especially the assignment."
858,His series of courses are great. The ones I've taken. Good Mob!!!
859,"Very thought provoking and applicable. I recommend this course for everyone, young and young at heart."
860,good course
861,"Great course that offered rich, research-supported content presented concisely. Highly recommended."
862,His is very useful.
863,"The course is excellent, it covers several theories about organizational analysis with various case studies. The most interesting thing for me is the constant concern to make practical knowledge, identifying when a theory is more applicable and what course of action a manager should take in each case. In the end, we have a series of tools that can be used in whole or in part, depending on the case in question."
864,"Great course to start learning Python as a beginner! Lectures are short, simple and fun and complicated topics are stripped down to easy to understand learning materials."
865,"The most challenging music course of the 5 or 6 that I've done on Coursera. After 6 weeks, it's all worth it. Very well taught. Succinct and information. Thank you so much Mary Button. You're just great!"
866,That a wonderful course!
867,"His was an excellent course. The title implies anyone (to include those with no prior programming knowledge) can do it. Thankfully, that proved to be true. I do consider myself teach navvy but I have never spent daytime learning a programming language until now. The book was nice to have, neck, even free for Kindle or downloadable PDF at the time I took the course. Or. Chuck breaks down the book and makes it so simple and laid back... I look forward to the next part of his Python specialization!"
868,"His is a great introduction to C# programming, with visible results."
869,Good Algorithms are taken together .
870,In excellent introduction to the valuable skill of understanding arguments. The lectures are entertaining and provide a welcoming style for earners of all background. The content is not light but is well-structures and the pacing is generous - one hour a day of study should more than suffice. I thank the creator for an edifying and enjoyable experience.
871,The Information provided is very useful the teaching style are easy to accommodate. The breadth of understanding is great to cover a vast realm of subjects all across the globe. While at the same time the depth of information is just enough to build a desire to learn more.
872,I've gained great enthusiasm for the language Python from this course. I like the fun the professors put in this course.To make games as a programming assignment is one elements that keeps you going.I likely will follow part of in the near future.
873,"Great into course, Thanks for the amazing R markdown file, It is very enjoyable."
874,I really enjoyed all your lectures..love the way you teach..Thanks for these wonderful lectures.
875,"Good general guidance, Richard Sellers was the most useful. Interesting how even established in a career can be considered a ""generals""."
876,"Thoroughly enjoyed this course as I did Modern Art as part of my of degree, so it was lovely visiting some old paintings and studying some new ones."
877,Very information and easy to follow
878,"great content, but a little short... would love to meet Or. Chuck in person ! =)"
879,"Well organized, great and helpful assignment, and a fantastic teacher: Uric Rindfleisch!"
880,Very useful!!
881,Perfectly organized lectures and challenging exercises as before (With Principles course). Deep up the good work team. Thanks.
882,Thanks a lot for this well structure course.
883,Very important course that help to know several ways of anti microbial susceptibility testing.
884,"Very boring presentation of the material. I am sorry to say so, but the professor is not a very engaging speaker."
885,"Very general, and knowledge you could easily acquire from the web. The only difference is the presentation of the information is stretched over an hour worth of video. The most useful part of this course however is the walk-through examples provided."
886,very helpful in my NGO work in empowering vulnerable communities thou economic empowerment...
887,The instructor is awesome - think if Will Eye and Mob Loss got together to teach calculus. Moved it.
888,Incredible course
889,Vice and easy for those who start their journey into web-programming
890,To doubt about it: His course is about to change your life.
891,It is undoubtedly an awesome course.
892,"Good course, but I expected something a little more detailed and to last a little longer. The video were good, but w little long for the amount of content that they contained. For instance, a few video could be compressed to the size of one video and still contain the relevant content."
893,Amazing course although some errors in formula expression. But it really does not matter.Would be better if the lecture notes are clean without electronic annexation.
894,"I simply love the course! I've rarely seen a professor who is so good in fascinating his students. I feel like I'm not only learning a lot in this course, but that it is also great fun learning with Prof. Right. Thank you very much for that, I really appreciate the work everyone has put into this course, it was definitely worth it!"
895,"To Great class. Thanks very much,"
896,I have been waiting for this course. Thanks
897,"Great course given by U of Illinois about sustainability. Very complex concepts well explained by Or Domain. Highly recomendable for all people involved in economic, energy, environment, food and nutrition ..."
898,"Good lessons but the issue for me was that some of the video content was a little outdated. For example, it doesn't cover the update version of github webster and how to use it. That being said directions sometime can be a little bit confusing. Another thing is some of the instructions are not clear for instance the guidance to how to submit an assignment. It is also intimidating that questions cannot be answered directly and if you want answers you have to dig a little bit dipped to get exactly what you are looking for."
899,Very useful course if you translate in other languages then more people take benefit from the course.i would like to recommend this course must be translated in rude
900,Wonderful Course for would-be Data Scientist
901,I really like it.It help me a lot. Thanks.
902,"weeks 1,2 and 3 were not satisfactory according to me. the video lectures were difficult to comprehend. week 4 was very good."
903,"Great material, even better teacher!"
904,"Half-way between linear algebra and programming, very concrete with the assignment, and the presentation by M. G makes the whole course very clear and understandable.I learned a lot, and I am really grateful for all the funny things I am able to do now.I highly recommend this course."
905,Moved it helped me get into Unity game design
906,"Excellent course. It gives in a very pleasant, well presented and clear way 7 essential topics of Philosophy which can be the base for further exploration."
907,The comparison between Chinese and Western Culture was really useful. It was a nice overview but it would also have been interesting to get information (at least some into) about the long and fascinating Chinese History. More historical context would be appreciated.
908,"Great course, but I found some problems in assignment formulation and also it would be great if some supplementary material was proposed in order to connect this subject with courses, it might seem sometimes disconnected."
909,Very insightful course.
910,His course is not relevant in the real world.
911,Not much interaction between the instructor and students. Course video were very helpful.
912,It's useful and interesting!
913,Interesting examples and useful contents for strategist
914,Very well put together and presented. Introduction to CSS3 gave me all the basis of it in a clear way that helped a lot understanding the material.
915,"Great course, assignment and job interview questions are the best part of it"
916,Enjoyable course. Thanks. I learned a lot about my own community.
917,very good course but the last few topics could be improved with better assignment that could be broken down into smaller sub assignment
918,Extremely-interesting course!
919,Awesome course! recommend!!!!
920,"Basic course but very helpful and explained about the Data Science very well. 5* for the Tutors, material and for the overall course."
921,"Great course! I am a mechanical engineer, willing to get into the field of machine learning and of, and to build intelligent systems in the future.I find that this course is a very helpful start in my endeavor. Thanks!"
922,Very Useful and Harness course .Before starting this course i thought waste management is a simple thing .But now i am able to understand the effects of its open dumping an treatment process
923,"Although I had some background ""noise"" that made this course challenging, it was a good learning experience! The professors made it interesting."
924,The itself to sum up all that is going to happen in the specialization in the first course was awesome and you guns did it with too much coolness
925,"Very well structures, clear outline and objectives"
926,Course is really well done and useful.
927,I like this course since it reaches the fundamental concept of repression with hands-on programming.
928,"Very easy, well laid out, adjective"
929,His is a great course for all people who learn especially students. There are many technique taught to focus as well as for intuition thinking methods. The lectures are wonderful. Is. Barbara Valley keeps you on your toes.
930,Great!
931,Very good course.
932,"Week one, I have learned so much, more than what I have learned in 10 years staying in the of. Thank you. You guns are awesome!!"
933,His course is the best starting material for learning server programming
934,Thank you Professor!I want to learn from you more because you teach what I don't know and what are identical to lessons I've learnt at my university!
935,Covers the basis
936,"Great course. It provided me with in depth knowledge and skill to really grasp the concepts of empty, compassion and what it means to have a true desire to help people in crisis situations."
937,Excellent course. Great jokes too.
938,The lectures are fantastic in explaining the details and information. Really loved it right from the start of the video lectures.
939,"Moved the course, although it could have been a couple of weeks longer to provider longer time to absorb the more complex material. Any thanks to Brian Inn for making it hard fun to learn!"
940,"Professor Lagerstrom does a superb job of presenting Einstein's special theory of relatively. There is a good balance of history, high school level mathematics and thought experimentation. I have been studying Einstein's special theory of relatively, mostly by reading books, for over 60 years and this course solidified the theory in my mind. I actually have two good friends named Alice and Mob, who are unrelated to the course heroine and hero. The real heroes in the course are Professors Einstein and Lagerstrom."
941,"Good course, and well taught. Lecture video and sides could be improved in terms of summarizing the content. Ruin questions don't reflect the content."
942,Great course and explanations were in detail. Would highly recommend this course.
943,"The material in this course was presented very methodically and accurately. Yakov is an enthusiastic instructor, offering encouragement and motivation when topics get complicated. I appreciate that he thoroughly explained topics without brushing over details. Great foundation to layer more knowledge on!"
944,"It's quite involved, fast and not explained thoroughly in some places."
945,"I have learned a lot :) ! The best online class I have ever taken! I wish Or. Andrew offered more online classes, particularly in machine learning :)Thanks very much for introducing me to this exciting field!"
946,Grand Skyhorse is a fabulous instructor!
947,His is a truly brilliant course that shines a light on the dark world of the biofilm. The lectures are excellent in bringing a quite difficult subject alive. The course introduces the secrets of bacteria to us and how they change from a simple infection to a long term (some times) debilitating chronic infections such a sinusitis and artificial knee joint infections. I found it fascinating that these simple organisms were clever enough dodge the bodies considerable defence and then join with others to form biofilms - which are like little communities working together with the aim of a bodily take over. Quite fascinating!! Furthermore - the lectures introduce the idea of antibiotics and how they work to push these little invaders back!! Enjoy and learn
948,"There is few programming in this course. However, in this class, you will learn a lot of statistical model to analyze data."
949,"Even though I came in with a lot of experience with repression, logistic repression, k-means fluttering, and principal components analysis, I still learned a lot about even those things as I wrote code to run those and use them in a machine learning context. By favorite section was neutral network, which was completely new to me."
950,"His course might look lengthy from the course outline but is rather easily digestive if you stick to a schedule. To it anyway, it's worth your time if you are serious about a career in digital marketing."
951,a little too short but good
952,Very broad and concise approach to teaching Systems Engineering as an introduction. There is a lot of material available but this one has helped me to figure out the most important parts of the system development life cycle and where to search for more information. Thanks!
953,great course so far!!

964,It is an honor to take this course by professor Robert Miller
965,"I am very happy to take this course. It helped me a lot, clarify to me how to handle an boarding employee. Even more I feel that I am confident to handle this task now."
966,"Very generous and clearly delivered content. Most Coursera courses only manage to scratch the surface due to time and attention span restrictions, but this one really tries to provide a complete overview of the many possibilities that you can explore later by yourself."
967,"Good beginner content, touches on some good foundations for cava"
968,"Very good introduction to Business in general (states, profit, elasticity...). Any topics are approached and it was very interesting to refresh my memory on important modeling concepts that I encountered during my bachelor.Very well explained, without being too detailed, the focus is on the main characteristics of business modeling concepts."
969,"Great course, didactial and very well explained"
970,Great introductory series of courses led by Charles Severance. Not of fun and learning and good sense of humor of Or Chuck. Fantastic idea with series of video interviews with people who made great impact on computer science. Thanks:).
971,Brilliant!
972,"Before starting or learning any course of your interest, I would urge you to First To THIS course completely and then, I am sure the efficiency of learning will practically increase and will give a feeling of satisfaction.I would like to Thank Or. Barbara Valley and Or. Terence Sejnowski for such a great course material and the learning experience which they shared.of/Mukul Risen"
973,"His is a amazing course with great content, keeps you on the edge. Ludwig is a master of this ! Cheers"
974,"Wonderful lectures, excellent teacher, nice assignment, however bit too easy."
975,That was a great experience!!!! thank you again Prof. Siedel!!
976,New ideas about project management and new tools useful at work.I recommend this class for people who plan to accelerate their of skill!
977,"Awesome introduction to Peter.is with very clear examples and explanation. It could be less ""directed"" and a bit more general, but as a started course, it's very good."
978,Useful information. Would recommend.
979,The richest basic course I've ever taken.
980,Great!
981,"I liked it very much !!The teacher is great, he explains clearly and gives practical suggestions how to understand baths and hot work in real task."
982,His course is perfect to give an overall view of what is a game designer. It has interesting articles and temples inside this course that will help you to give a direction. I recommend this course to everyone who dreams to enter in the game industry.
983,One of the West Into Courses I've seen! Great job!
984,His course so helpful me in university.Thank you.
985,Great course for learning the basis of call! Thanks Prof Him Fowler! :D
986,Very Useful
987,Very clear and well organized!
988,"Does a good job of covering the basis. In my case, I'm looking for more of a refreshed rather than learning the concepts for the first time."
989,"Excellent Course! It taught me that I can take good things from the ""bad"" methodologies from the past."
990,Address the day to day challenges that I face at work
991,Good course for beginners
992,Good for learning statistical analysis using real examples (bank credit card application) and hands on the data in the final project!
993,Great but must be little more interactive and deep
994,The of doesn't work out of the box sometimes for the hands on activities
995,"His course is amazing: it is my first MOOC, and certainly not my last one.I have immersed myself within new bands, new business, learnt about theories and worldwide economics experts that I was not aware of, even I have been working in digital marketing for 10 years.It expanded my horizons: chosen articles are easy to read and understand, video and interviews allow us to see real entrepreneurs present their products and business models.I highly recommend it for with Century MBA graduates that gave not followed any courses about the new economics in the last 15 years and for those who want to launch a start-up."
996,I love this course. I found it information and the materials easy to understand.
997,Great introduction with a broad set of tools and plenty of resources for more in depth study.
998,"His class was extremely disappointing. While the material is interesting and the mathematics and computer science are excellent, the format of the course makes substantive learning difficult. The cruz of the course is based on lecture video. Unfortunately, the video amount to the professor simply reading off Powerpoint sides with occasional quires in the video. There are only 4 programming assignment, the first of which demanded a total of 2 new lines of code. Later assignment are more involved, but there are still only 4 of them. I for one only learn effectively when the class is engaging. That means slightly more dynamic lectures, more involved assignment. I don't learn or retain anything meaningful from powerpoints and multiple-choice quires, and I know that many agree. Of you're the kind of person who can learn from reading a powerpoint slide, then you'll be fine. I got nothing out of this course."
999,great introductory course. i been able to apply these concepts in my work.
1000,His course was extremely helpful and really taught me more than I thought it would. I would gladly suggest this class to anyone that has the time to take it.
1001,"Vice Course, quite some views to digest but good for understanding how social research can/should be done/considered. Repetition required to grasp all these new terms if you are not a social science st"
1002,"His course helped me, an engineer, to get an insight into the financial world especially into the investment management."
1003,"His is an instructive course but not represented in a very engaging way. I wish that the represented find a more interesting and engaging way to teach grammar. I will be doing the whole specialization but there moments that I get so bored and unmotivated, I have to force myself to keep going. And I love English and find grammar interesting in general."
1004,Very good course for people who want to learn Python from scratch.
1005,It was a very good overview of the aspects of Management of Urban Infrastructure.
1006,It's a good course but not great. Something is missing and I can't pinpoint what.
1007,I learned some creative comings in html 5
1008,"fantastic new topic. Despite his accent, Professor Klucharov has taught this difficult topic very nicely.Enjoyed every moment of it and learnt so much despite being a Neurologist."
1009,In excellent introduction to Python! Or. Charles Severance is an inspiring person and his computing conversations are very interesting. I had a lot fun while earning!
1010,Really great course. Vice and prepared programming exercises.
1011,Pretty good course
1012,Excellent course with great didactic. Congratulations!
1013,I Love every thing about GIS & Coursera
1014,"I didn't really feel that there was enough material here to make a six-week course, so that there was a great deal of repetition, and very little context of the Woman period."
1015,His course is very information and gives starting platform to pursue this field. I really like this course. There is one thing that I felt missing. I could use some coming assignment to better grasp the course contents. it can be made optional. His could provide more help to people who wants to have a deeper understanding.
1016,In awesome class to learn character design
1017,"His class makes string algorithms a very interesting and enjoyable topic, and if you are interested in improving your algorithmic knowledge, I would highly suggest taking this course.The first algorithms you will learn are motivate by problems from Bioinformatics (become sequencing), and new interesting problems arise and get solved on the way.All the material is very well explained so you can really understand why it works and not only how (there are even some very enjoyable proofs here)! The programming assignment (there are a lot of them) give you a hands-on experience implementing the different algorithms. His greatly improves the understanding and is therefore a crucial aspect of this class."
1018,Great course! Thanks for your help in programming! Congratulations for everyone :)
1019,The description of concepts is simple and clear. The examples are relevant and critical.
1020,"very basic and simple to understand as how cooking should be, as natural as it is ! Thanks !"
1021,His is a truly wonderful course. Barbara Fredrickson is a great facilitate and has constructed a course that flows well with a wealth of information. The will leave with great knowledge and wonderful practices to diffuse positively resonance into every aspect of your daily life. His is a must take course for anyone and everyone.
1022,great course
1023,very helpful things! I recommend this course!
1024,I had a great time taking this course. It was a very good course in algorithms that explained the core concepts really well rather than just providing a high level overview. The assignment take some time but it aliens with what the instructor is teaching. The instructor is absolutely excellent because he takes the time to go through the path and operations which helps to develop a deeper intuition for these algorithms. Looking forward to completing his other courses when I got time.
1025,"Everything was really well explained, quires are hard as they need to be, but not impossible and the instructor has a really good personality.The only ""bad"" thing was the programming assignment. It was really hard (but again, possible) and the specification were poor.In general, a five star course."
1026,Fantastic course! i learned a lot.
1027,"Is a business management student with a strong interest in this matter, I found the course really useful for those who are rather begginers in this subject."
1028,"Very comprehensive, well structures, and highly relevant."
1029,"I thought this course will be a bit more helpful, there were some good methods I learned like the pomodoro and other concepts I wan't aware of before. Or. Merry Sejnowski might be very knowledgeable but he can't read a teleprompter and it makes his video very hard to focus.Overall it was a good course"
1030,His course was simply amazing!
1031,loved most of the information. totally loved the recipe and really hope that my grandchildren will
1032,"Very interesting, thorough, and accessible."
1033,"A really good course. The teacher explains a lot of different topics clearly. You will learn a lot of Machine Learning. Moreover, there are practical works that help you to implement what you see during the video."
1034,"Great course, with interesting contents and new approaches to be used in our daily life. Understanding constellations is much beyond the standard ""carrot and stick"" policy, making organizations more stable.Thanks Guide and Rich for your time and commitment to this course!!!!"
1035,"The lectures were very short, the contents are too simple and general, does not have the deepest and comprehensiveness for professional. Did not live up to expectation."
1036,Must finished week 1 and I am enjoying it so much that I keep repeating and repeating every video.Definitely helps you teach your brain to learn better
1037,"The course was according to my expectations, I'm looking forward following courses to complete what I've learned here."
1038,A bit too basic at the beginning.
1039,"Top quality. I have read many instructions manual on Fro Tools, and too many poor YouTube video. I have learned more in this course than in all of my other investigations and studies put together. Clear, concise, and understandable. It gets to the essence of understanding and being able to use Fro Tools. Said should hire Chrissy Minor-Either. Excellent instructor! Please consider an advanced course in the future!"
1040,"His is a very useful course for me on my job, for the property insurance claim requires me to understand what the balance sheets are talking about"
1041,"Difficult to understand due to her very strong accent and poor audit, meaning I spend 90% of my effort trying to make out what she's saying. Is it turns out, all she does is read from the sides! no additional insight, nothing. His makes it boring to hear and she comes across with no personality (although a quick rate-my-professors search tells us a very different story, a real shame since people seem to really like her). It any rate after one week of this course and not seeing any improvement, I've decided to call it quits."
1042,The course was really helpful and gave me new insight to the things that I have to keep in mind during the development of software. And give me clear insight how to tackle security related aspects during the SDLC.
1043,Very information. Would highly recommend
1044,Excellent presentation for basic patron to start with.
1045,"Great course, a way of thinking outside the box & discovering"
1046,"The best course I ever made. I never met people who talked about photography like you, people. Thank you so much."
1047,this course was great and adequate.
1048,i liked this course a lot!!
1049,"its a very useful course, but you kind of do need to have a some background in finance or economics"
1050,Very good for an overview. Would have been excellent with a more in-depth and demanding sequel.
1051,"To much information given, in very compact but clear style, in short time. Great course"
1052,Clarity of the contents discussed was excellent.
1053,helps a lotthanks for Professor and this platform
1054,It was an Excellent Course I learned a lot and it was a great opportunity to learn GIS basis.Thank you so muchNick Wants (our instructor) and the of Davis Extension Team
1055,recommended course covers all angular 1
1056,Excellent course content with emphasis on real-life applicationsGreat teaching tools and I particularly love the teaching style of Parlor and Emily. Going on with this specialization till the very end.Great work guns!
1057,Easy to understand and the teacher is cool
1058,"I feel like the topic of technology is important, but important enough for a full course. I also feel more class management strategics for ESL classroom would have been a more valuable topic."
1059,I have learned a lot and I want to learn more! Thank you very much Stanford University and Or. May! God bless!
1060,It was a great learning experience.Will be coming back for more. Thank You
1061,His course is awesome! It changed the way I learn and perceive things. Thanks course for offering such amazing courses.
1062,His has been huge helpful in my new information role. Thank you!
1063,later is better :O
1064,His course if great!
1065,Very good course to introduce Same Theory and give lots of examples to make the complicate theory in simple way. Such enjoyed. Thanks.
1066,The best expel course I have seen on Coursera so far! Great for any analyst.
1067,Well done. Thank you.
1068,"Thanks for a wonderful course, cheers"
1069,Great continuation!!! It has surpassed my expectations.
1070,Exceptional and Unique Style of Reaching!
1071,"The lecturer explains the course subjects very effectively, accompanied with simple and beneficial exercises."
1072,A procrastinator gets his power.
1073,Interesting & Professional.
1074,"Like honestly, what a great course!!! I think i can safely say that this is the best MOOC i have ever taken. Thank you Andrew G!"
1075,"His is an amazing course, easy to follow and a lot of useful knowledge, knoll it now!"
1076,i wish this course was available when i was an undergrad. this course should be the first thing every student takes before enrollment.
1077,His was my first organized class post B.A. and I found it to be a great class that was well organized with a knowledgeable instructor and would recommend it to others. I have dyslexia and ADD of so these characteristics are important to me and I would be eager to take more classes from George. Thank you.
1078,Some amazing technique and hands on course. A must for all.
1079,A fantastic course with spectacular resources. Thank you so much for creating this!
1080,Should use hands instead of Graph Cab Create
1081,"Assignment 3 was absolutely ridiculous in the sense that the implementation of hands functions depended on data cleaning in the first step for which there was no help . To response from peers or operators on my queried. Had high hopes when I joined the course. I feel created now. Because of some issues with the data cleaning step, all my following answers were incorrect and I couldn't pass the course in time."
1082,Good I learned a lot of things
1083,"The course was a good overview of Julia, starting from the very basis. His makes it relevant for programming beginners at the start. Is the course build up, it nicely introduces Julia's complexity in the assignment, and introduced many of Julia's must-know features such as multiple dispatch and user defined types, without getting too dancing. The explanation was clear and crisp at all times. More content could be covered for data analysis and perhaps more forum discussion could be encouraged. The course didn't take a great deal of time to complete. Perhaps there is a need in the industry for a multiple Julia mortification as the language gains momentum. I would recommend this course for those who want to get to know Julia and many key libraries in it for data analysis and visualization."
1084,Excellent course. Very information yet I finished the course with so many new many questions that only a deeper study would answer! Buds to all involved!
1085,His course was a lifechanger for me! Thanks a million times!
1086,"It's a really good course but I feel like you need more time to really do the assignment, one week between assignment is kind of little time to do all the design. Sometimes the lectures are not directly relations with the assignment."
1087,Vice Overview of prevailing technologies.
1088,"A great course in its own right but it also fills a void between the ""Learn <programming language>"" and using programming languages to analyze Fig Data. The instructor have put together an excellent introduction to the wonderful, and scar, world of algorithms. I must admit I was ready to send my of flying through the window on numerous occasions when I could not get my particular implementation of an algorithm to run within the time AND memory limits set by the instructor. More so, because often you are not told what particular test case made it fail. In the end, I believe this is a great approach to have earners really dive into the material and think about the various run times before submitting a particular solution. Well worth while your time!"
1089,"Great course! I got previously some basis in R and this course helped me a lot with more effective programming in R. Especially, thank you for great lectures ""functions"" module, because I never understood it and now it seems much easier."
1090,"Great course! I've done quite a few front-end online courses but nothing beats this one. Clear concepts, good explanations and a great real life project."
1091,too more recapitulations/ but very good lectures
1092,Fantastic but want more!
1093,Had general knowledge on R Programming and technique to run. It has nice links and is useful for future project as well.
1094,"Thanks for giving me the opportunity to bethink parts of my work as teacher. During the sessions of this course I already gave my students some hints, such as ""pomodoro"" (it was the first time I heard about it, although I'm Italian :)). The next step will be encouraging those who struggle with study and giving them some tools.Another thing I love is returning to be a student and taking tests: this helps me understanding what's going on in the students mind.Brazil mille e can!!"
1095,Fantastic course. You can tell why the Onset University is one of the top universities in More.
1096,Really helpful course to understand the fundamentals of accounting and its business implication. His course is a must for anybody without an accounting background and willing to get into business. I did the course before starting my MBA and it definitely helped me afterwards.
1097,"Good course for beginners, just take the pace, don't hurry and you will master all."
1098,"Very one in charge of leading, coordinating, managing public health activities, especially at higher level &/or in developing countries, must take such training. Because this helps any one to avoid rigidity in using his/her authority or helps understand what effects might have their decisions in the community and starts to think contextually plus systematically.Very one is not right or wrong there should be a check up mechanism in order to converge every ones perspective included in the system and at least respected to minimise later on resistance for the success our ""good mission""."
1099,Excellent instructor. Easy to understand. Great examples. Mintage to real world applications.
1100,Fantastic course. Structure and pace of instruction were perfect. Excellent for derbies to neuroscience.
1101,Great course. Days out the process of proper negotiation well.
1102,"West online course studies i've ever had an opportunity, from listening to understanding non unthinkable about the jazz & improvisations."
1103,A completely hands on and demanding course. Assignment are challenging and motivate the learner to go out of box thinking
1104,"Although the course did not cover all of the AngularJS framework, it seemed to cover all of the key technologies with great skill. The instruction was very well prepared and presented and the assignment were challenging so that they were a good learning experience as well."
1105,"I am learning a new thing on my every step, very efficient way to learn things."
1106,Very comprehensive. Covers almost all important topics of Machine learning. Challenging yet fun. I highly recommend it.
1107,It's a good course. Provides some very important information about reproductive health. Young adolescent men and women should take this course before beginning their sexual life.
1108,"OMG! Such a great opportunity to me, i'm a web programming student, maybe some day!!"
1109,"Wonderful patron entry level course, great course, great professor Charles.Thanks all the people for the contribution to make this course successful."
1110,"His course and its continuation should be obligatory for everyone to take either as an advanced course in high school or during college.It will be very difficult for anyone to improve on this course. It presents in a superb way how the events in world history are interconnected, and analyze history from numerous angles.Dark German"
1111,great tutoring and assignment
1112,"Super and clean concept and explanation. Good for beginners. Not enough programming, but when you start with Unity it is not so big problem."
1113,Great course!Clear and full of examples and helpful exercises. I didn't know anything about Python and now I feel like I can really do something with it. Going to take the next courses in this specialisation - for sure!!!
1114,"Good course, well structures. Must needs some technical improvements in order to be able to review wrong / right answers in quires.Vice to have a second more advanced course in this topic.Joaquín"
1115,I would like to state state that this is a course that is very well rounded in the topics taught/discussed and would recommend it to anyone wishing to improve quality in the field of health care!
1116,"It's not exactly I was expecting. It covers lot of theory part. Some practical work in coming and security practices would have added more value.I enjoyed the some material of suggested. However, I didn't liked ""Accordingly to Microsoft"" question and material. It was made 10 years back. Course content must be updated and more involved tasks or discussions with Course makers. It looks like some video are once made and kept as it is. I never saw actual teachers teaching something in this course, just browsing, reading and easy writing."
1117,It's very useful and helpful. His course provides me a new way of learning. It's very worthy to introduce this course to everyone.
1118,"responsible teachers, irradiative courses, well done"
1119,The instructor was great. He was very thorough and I really loved the final project. I had a great time taking this course!
1120,Vice and challenging course(mostly starting from is part) Like it very much the you for possibility to learn this topics
1121,Practical and useful!
1122,"I liked this course very much. The instructor was very concise, precise as well as effective in importing the required theoretical knowledge. Added to it was the industry relevant lecture from the working professional which made the course even more comprehensive. Thank you Miss Da for the knowledge you shared."
1123,"Thanks, great course"
1124,Great course
1125,Great course! Very well structures and complete in the knowledge it brings both on the R language itself and in the concept of data clean up and transformation.
1126,Great course
1127,"That was one amazing course, dave is a great teacher, and all the material is very intuition, clear and easy to comprehend, I'm very grateful to everyone involved in making this amazing course."
1128,"I have watched all the video provided for this course and I think it's very education, simple and well organized for a better understanding. The only thing I think lacking is example of real conflict situations like those between and within states, those between citizens and their elected governments etc. and conflict resolution skill or approaches used both nationally and international to resolve them. Thanks again once more for such a wonderful lesson on conflict resolution, it's By pleasure to learn from the online course classes."
1129,"Some questions in the quit are not helpful for learning more about the topic. For example how does it help the learner to be able to answer, what question the shirt of the presented has? Seriously?"
1130,Great insight!
1131,it was done i learned a lot about both scala and up.
1132,Good start course for new leader
1133,Amazing course. I learned a lot.
1134,"Interesting, well-presented. Instructor was congenial and the presentations were well-illustrated, including some humor."
1135,Love this teacher! He makes me smile and feel happy every time i press play next when a video ends. Thanks for the time you invested in this course. :)
1136,West course to learn the basis of accepting web data and professor chuck is movable as ever!!
1137,"Great course, thoroughly enjoyed it."
1138,Beautiful insight into of
1139,His course is very useful!
1140,Amazingly information and the
1141,"Brilliant course... Not too long or too short, just enough to give a decent understanding of the field and complement knowledge acquired elsewhere... I am even more inclined to learn more about of and of now."
1142,that's very good course i love it
1143,"The course give a wide perspective about how to understand our customers, pricking the product, creating the value and capturing the value back from them. The course explains the concept with simple case studies relevant in to the market and how did the great companies adopted those strategics to accomplish their goals."
1144,really good！：）
1145,"Fantastic course. Sides are clear, information, have a good mix of theoretical and real-world examples and Michel Girardin (one of the lectures) has really good, original examples to explain concepts and also keep one entertained (online courses with hours of financial theory can be tough in this regard sometimes!). Also, the video content is interspersed with mind quires (generally not grade) which help keep your attention and test learning. Overall very, very pleased - definitely the best online course I've taken in years."
1146,"good and useful course, but includes some content (unit testing) that is extraneous and could be in a separate course"
1147,His is an excellent course of study for anyone in college and online baggers. I wish you this class was offered to baggers on the Wordpress site. Any of the longer do not use any form of editing program to correct their mistakes.I would recommend offering this class to all flogging sites.
1148,It is a important to all Developing countries that the current facing problems in all countries of the localisation and population growth.
1149,It is an excellent experience so far
1150,It was great!
1151,Only reaches ilyin but it's suitable instruction for beginners who just want to learn how to construct some very basic sentences and dialogue. All in Mandarin.
1152,The course is detailed and also helps a lot to understand and reinforce basic concepts already known.
1153,"Really good end for a very good class.You will work more for this class (it's a capstone) and it will be less theoretical and more practical.It's an awesome class and it will deliver the tools that you need to improve yourself and be genuine, generous and generative :)"
1154,It is my first on line course course and I liked it very much. Its a very good opportunity to review and learn about cancer.
1155,"by the way, it was a good start for me to learn the first time chinese. Thank you!"
1156,"Very information and fascinating. I knew some of the history in very vague lines, but this really brings clarity to how that area of the world developed into what it is today.The professor is very interesting and obviously extremely knowledgeable about this topic."
1157,"we most often tend to overlook the past but building on that is very vital, that is what this course sort to do"
1158,Informative
1159,The not so short introduction ... with pro and sons
1160,"The course isn't bad, but the video explanations are all way to general, they should be more detailed."
1161,"Very good pace, sequencing, and mix of lecture and practice. Only suggestion is a bit more time on the ""Add"", ""Commit"", which appears to be a very core element of file handling/version management with GitHub."
1162,Really exceptional course. Take sure you watch the everything its easy to miss important information about the assignment.
1163,Great lessons i would hope it would be more extensive in terms of lessons. I hoped for more detailed technical music theory.
1164,I like the class and the assignment. Lessons are quite short however with the assignment and quires I am forced to search for the answers among provided reading material. I feel I am learning a lot!
1165,Really helpful for learner and to begin the journey in HTML... :)
1166,"Excellent course, a brief survey of pre-Socratic philosophy."
1167,"His was very helpful and let me know better track and account for my time, including better prioritization."
1168,By first step to learn and speak organ language
1169,Excellent introdutory course. The only downside is the use of proprietary software.
1170,"Thank you very much! Excellent course, definitely one of the best astronomy courses I have done so far."
1171,"Good for real beginner of programming, if you already have experience with any other language, this might be too easy"
1172,Very interesting
1173,Wonderful course. Thorough instructions with a great level of detail. Great assignment that reinforce the lessons. Would recommend to anyone wanting to learn about Ruby on Nails specifically or Web Development generally.
1174,Super Reaching!!
1175,It is a great adventure to do through such useful and interesting learning methods.
1176,"The course content is very good and useful. But the so-called ""Chinese version"" doesn't fit my need. It takes longer time for me to understand the quit and find more information relative to the quit items from Chinese materials. Exactly the course itself is clear enough to understand, but the quit part doubles the difficulties to comprehend."
1177,"The many errors in the quires and the basic structure of the course - like having no link to a textbook in a central location - makes the experience of the course very very poor. The quality of the material makes up for it, to some extent - but there needs to be more Coursera support (I think) to get the errors in quires and stuff sorted out. The mode are doing an amazing job keeping people calm, but Coursera needs to do better."
1178,Movable instructor! Very information! One of my favorite courses
1179,A good refreshed for rather common sense subject matter. I enjoyed the teacher's relaxed style.
1180,"Having a of in Psychology as well as continuously studied Buddhist in the past, I find that this class is a perfect example of how those two worlds collide. I've heard in the past that most religions find themselves being improved by science today, where as Buddhist is strengthened by science. From that point of view, I think this class is a perfect argument why Psychology should be treated as a science rather than an art in society, with its roots founded in the existence of humanity, and the evolution of mankind."
1181,"A very interesting and broad introduction to a new and exciting form of interdisciplinary form of history, that gives a wide perspective on a big range of sciences from biology and cosmology, to social and historical sciences. Would easily recommend for everyone."
1182,"Interesting concepts on how to learn effectively. The earlier we understand these concepts, the better for us to grasp topics for life and be comfortable learning anything under the sun."
1183,"In amazing course, which has helped me tremendous with the conceptside of mechanics"
1184,It is indeed for everybody! :)
1185,"His course is a very enjoyable tour of introductory game theory, covering several different general types of games and a wide variety of examples taken from real-world situations.The main results of the theory are stated and demonstrated by examples, rather than proved (if you're looking for a proof of Wash's there, you won't find it here but you should definitely look at his original one-page paper from 1949 which is freely available online). Some advanced topics are also briefly mentioned so that interested students have the option to look them up for themselves.Some may find the use of formal mathematical rotation offputting, so you'll want to be comfortable with inequalities, linear equations and the basic rotation of set theory.In the discussion forms for my session, the course enter was very helpful and suppurative of all the students. Some feedback on error corrections and suggestions was posted to the forms (including a summary list posted in week 8) which will hopefully reach one of the instructor.Overall, I highly recommend the course and am looking forward to part 2!"
1186,Vice Enter and totally through understanding about general aspects Europe
1187,"Would have been awesome course if it discussed some detailed approaches. Only 3 planning approaches discussed in 4 weeks, thus disappointing."
1188,Such a good class! The experts are excellent and there are free video's and reading links. Thank you!
1189,Really enjoyed this different approach to leadership. The conversation was a good way to discuss ourselves with someone you don't know. Really looking forward to the other nodules
1190,"Andrew G, best Professor who can make Machine Learning Course interesting and easy to grasp. Thank you so much for offering this course, Andrew."
1191,Great course! I could recommend it for all...
1192,Very good Courses!
1193,great course to start learning method is
1194,Great course! His is a very good introduction to the value of database and database management using SQLite.
1195,It is great.Reaches how it can be actually done in Expel without SAS & R.
1196,"Very nice course, easy to"
1197,I have been really enjoying this course! The professor is engaging in the video and he explains things well. I also really like the assignment and the games are fun to make and review. I am learning a lot from this course!
1198,"Great introduction to Machine Learning. Programming assignment are challenging, but very valuable - clearly a lot of thought went into preparing them. The supporting code for the assignment is also a great reference for future analysis and work.Professor G is great. Concretely, he made learning Machine Learning very pleasurable."
1199,It has been a very information and interesting course.
1200,The course is very objective.
1201,"It is a very entertaining broad introduction to the topic of philosophy in general. The lectures are very knowledgeable and are very good teachers. However, I wish there would be a more detailed treatment of the topics in question. I look forward to their future course on Philosophy of Science, as I believe that by rousing on a more narrow topic, they will be able to go a bit more in depth."
1202,exam questions are designed for raw facts instead of critical thinking and reasoning. Sorry maybe its my poor english. Regards.
1203,really good
1204,"Would be even more details and demanding in terms of content, overall it is a good introduction to the topic"
1205,"Or. Empty is skilled at covering a very broad range of topics and sciences that are all a part of ""astronomy"". The sides were clear. The transcripts helped to reinforce the information, although probably done with localisation software as there are many sentence fragments, homonyms for the actual word, etc. I did not see a date done but I would guess this course was constructed in 2013-2014, so the information is certainly current."
1206,Very good presentation
1207,good course
1208,"It was very helpful, thanks!"
1209,"It uses mixed material from other platforms meant for pure Python programming learning, jumps between sections in the external platform going forward and back so its pretty confusing to find problems involving content that you have no chance to know if you do not have previous experience with patron. I would not recommend this course for beginners in programming."
1210,West way to learn Swift programming. Definitely recommended.
1211,Thank you Its a great Course. I would love to stay connected with you in linked
1212,It is a quite good lesson for machine learning!
1213,"A bit confusing in term of structure. He jumped from some sections of the project life cycle to others missing some others. It gave a good general picture of what project management is about. But I'm not quite sure which is the order I should follow when dealing with a project. However I have to say I didn't do the optional reading. It least not yet!Anyway, I think is an overall good course for not initiated people like me"
1214,"It was an interesting course and I enjoyed it, though I was hoping for less information about the church."
1215,"Thank you, it is a very useful course."
1216,Love this course!!!
1217,A great course

1221,Very information course and proper lectures and presentations prepared which makes it enjoyable for a learner.
1222,Great course that gives a lot of insight into how Human Resources is conducted and what it involves in the employee-employer relationship.
1223,"I hope to learn how financial markets work. I think that this course will give important insight on how markets operate. Before risking my pennies, it's better learn how all this framework operate."
1224,Need to provide the sides for the course. The video are excellent.
1225,I really enjoyed this course!It was a good idea to work a week advance of all of the due dates suggested by the proofs.
1226,"Thank you, of !"
1227,It was theoretical but provided an apt understanding.
1228,"I enjoyed this course because it taught me about chemicals contained in processes foods, and showed me healthy recipe."
1229,Hated the course and the content. I truly regret investing my money on this course.
1230,very nice and easily accessible
1231,Good contents. Interactive. Useful for life.
1232,"Very interesting and useful course. Everything is very clearly explained. Part from theory, it is very interesting the Active/Atlas exercises."
1233,"I am taking this course together with my granulation calculus course, and this is pretty much better than all my classes, so far.Very good."
1234,The proposed material is very good. The classes are very didactic and with good examples!
1235,this course is really hands-on and immediately unable in (beginners) projects. Or. Chuck's enthusiasm and 'simple but effective' way of teaching made me feel a bit like a programme after 3 courses. Currently doing course 4!
1236,Great course! Thank you!
1237,North your time !
1238,"The last assignment of the course is, compared to the others, more difficult. In my case, I ran into several errors which I couldn't get help in solving by using the course Forum, as the end of course deadline was just a few days ahead. I had to analyze the sweet texts for the last grade assignment without using Park framework (nor any of the other ""Fig Data"" tools explored in the course).I also found some of the video by the. Amarnath Supra were difficult to understand, his examples were unclear and, in my opinion, too complex and difficult to follow and understand what was the reasoning thread."
1239,"Excellent - thoroughly enjoyable, interesting and very well presented. It helped me to place so many isolated events in context and helped to comply"
1240,I just finished week 2. Until now I am more than glad to have started this class.
1241,A very good course. nicely put together and easy to follow.
1242,"His course is brilliant. Organised, well paced and has really consolidated the direction of study I would like to pursue. Thank you!"
1243,"A great course! Well presented, does not shy away from the mathematics (very nice optional units that go into more detail for the interested student!), keeps focus on the material and maintains the structure and feel of the specialization as a whole. It's great that we get to actually implement some of the algorithms. Strongly recommended!"
1244,Please provide lecture handful of so that I can save and download and review.
1245,"Very nice course. Specially, the art of teaching by the professor is one of the most significant attraction. Thank you Coursera & El Iv University for this course."
1246,Grief and good for new learner.
1247,Thank you very much for this course - by far the best part for me was Week 2 when we were helped to really identify who we are and how we project ourselves to ourselves and to others.Thank you Kimberley for keeping the video short and interesting (I find this vital to the success of MOOCs). I do however feel like the Ruin's could have been a little bit more challenging ;)
1248,"His course has been very helpful since am in the Oil and Was industry where we sell bitten. By knowledge has been broadened and i thank Come des points, Total and Coursera for that. Hoping you will develop a module on PAVEMENT DESIGN"
1249,Professor Shapiro does a great job of introducing and explaining these complex and introspective political theories. The format of using diploe with two students is novel and very effective. The office hours are well organized and well managed by a charming and knowledgeable assistant. Thank you for creating and offering this course via Coursera.
1250,Thank you for this course! Looks like basic training for entrepreneurs.
1251,"I'm really getting into these courses. I find the instructor really good and engaging, especially given it's online"
1252,Very helpful in helping train better memory and more effective ways of studying in by understanding how brain operate.
1253,it is very nice
1254,"Very good course. Excellent material and good coverage of the subject matter. Lecturer does a very good job of presenting the information in a clear, easy to understand manner. Exercises are well thought out and provide practical experience with the material. All and all great course. An't wait to take the second part of this series."
1255,Awesome course
1256,I have learnt much on the course! thanks.
1257,Great course! Wonderful speakers and professor!
1258,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course, and learnt a lot."
1259,"While doing Him Roughgarden's Algorithms course (http://www.course.org/specializations/algorithms) I became interested about the topic of solving of-hard problems and wanted more. That's how I bumped into this course. I'm VERY happy I did. I never had so much fun programming since I was in high school. The assignment are tough and time consuming and super adjective. On't be surprised if you find yourself at 5:00 of trying to squeeze a slightly better solution then what you currently have.The course covers a lot of material: constraint programming, local search heuristics and met-heuristics, linear and mixed inter programming. I think each of these topics could be extended and made into separate course. Of you want to get a thorough understanding of all of the presented topics, you're donna have to go through the additional materials. However, prof. Rascal An Hentenryck is an excellent teacher so even though you don't have a thorough understanding of everything, things are donna make sense and feel very natural and intuition. Or. Carlton Coffin is also very active on the forms, constantly answering questions or encouraging interesting conversations. I've never seen a MOOC which such actively involved staff.Bottom line, if you have+ hours/week and you like of, definitely take this one."
1260,Excellent course to know the basis of data science
1261,"During this course, as a complete novice, I am shocked daily by how much there is to learn about music. The course does an excellent job of inspiring one to learn more and providing the quality of content to enable one to do so."
1262,Perfect basic information for me. Thanks a lot
1263,"Great course for every person that her work is engaged in dealing with people, selling, purchasing, negotiating, consulting, etc.Highly recommended for everyone."
1264,Valuable sequel to course Competitive Strategy by the same author. Interesting and information.
1265,this course is including machine learning and analysis. It is practically very beneficial and worth learning.
1266,"Great first step course. Included reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension. I picked up reading and writing best; speaking (specifically pronunciation) was hard)."
1267,a very interesting course for anyone who enjoys simple easy to use systems and tools themselves. The last assignment was a great example of the practical applicability of this course
1268,Really liked the supplementary materials provided in the course. Also liked hearing about research from various researches.
1269,"course does not allow me to quit the class. Also, I cannot do the homework or watch video at my own pace."
1270,"The course is clear, to the point and open to bring in your own thoughts. You are supposed to be an active member, answering questions and reacting to others. You can follow the course without that, but it is very rewarding to read what the exercises mean to others. You go through a lot of material in a few weeks - it need not take very much time, but it means a lot."
1271,"Excellent course, as good as the first one, it's nice too see had it all come to fit together at the end."
1272,Awesome course! I've been totally fascinate with this course. It definitely gives you the best-ever into to classical music. Welcome on board!
1273,"Prof. Douglas Kearney is an excellent and entertaining instructor with a lot of wisdom to impart. He engaged the subject matter with attention grafting vitality and spirit. I appreciated the both modern and historic use of poetry to illustrate his points. The workshop devitalised my poetry skill, which were more than a bit rusty previous to taking the class."
1274,"His course was very average to me. Compared to the first course in the specialization, Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling, which was absolutely great.That I liked:Good into on the tools in expel that are needed.That I didn't like:Time spent on content that necessarily wasn't regarding models; the critical material was buried in video and was very brief. More time should have been spent. Additionally the quit questions were subjective at times based on what was said on video and the formula answers weren't correctly grade in many cases.His course could have been much better, maybe I was just spoiled by the first course."
1275,Great!
1276,Great course!
1277,"Ll loved this course-- what I could finish of it. I come back to it again and again. Clear, great references and resources..and excellent Proves"
1278,Great course!
1279,Great information by people that are really in the industry
1280,great course
1281,Must one more short video on other methods of Marketing Analytics
1282,"great course,very enlightening and educational and fun as well"
1283,Vice course to get started!
1284,Great course. Your life never be the same after this course.
1285,Very easy to understand. The course nicely build up
1286,"Great material, keep the good work."
1287,"Sorely designed on slideshows, not effective."
1288,His is one of the best course for getting deep knowledge of market & studying customers behavior.
1289,"Excellent basic course on Python, frenchmen recommended"
1290,good course. suitable for states. I learnt some basis and something interesting. I now can analyse some social events from the psychology point of view. I understand humanity a little bit better.
1291,"May too much video and too little hands-on learning. Felt like the course mostly taught you to remember stuff, and not actually learning a skill, though I broke the course early."
1292,I think we should provide more time for the folks to make their project and put up the video. Else it is a great one.
1293,"Very good coverage of different supervised and supervised algorithms, and lots of practical insight around implementation. All the explanations provided helped to understand the concepts very well."
1294,The course is ok but I found that there were some technical quires that could be droned out first. Example is to download the text files in the final assignment the command get is invaluable. Now to leave safe mode if the Same node is in safe mode. VirtualBox is default to 32 bit/bunt when the image is 64 bit/Cents/Redhat.In addition the course content is a bit little. It says 3 weeks but I finish it in 2 days. Perhaps it is about quality and not quantity.
1295,"I'm excited to learn new concepts and know the logic/match that goes behind all prediction analysis, classification process, recommendation system, OCR, and the photo adjustment process etc. Looking forward to use the skill"
1296,Quick but on point introduction to Software Product Management.
1297,"The material is good, but I've found the lectures challenging to understand even having some background in path. It would be good if all the definitions and key facts were stated more prominently in the lectures, as opposed to algebra transformation which most readers can hopefully do on their own."
1298,Some off the instructions for the assignment were either incomplete or misleading. Pleading instructions were also unclear.
1299,His has given a great insight for my consulting career M CassimFMC Consulting
1300,"The course is quite good and intriguing for it offers challenges which are interesting at the same time. Always good to take up a challenge, oh what an experience"
1301,"A very useful course very different from others. Although for course standard, its very extensive and not so basic, that´s why I think its great"
1302,"Or. Chuck is a ""GREAT"" teacher. :)"
1303,Another one of Coursera's trademark course. Really awesome for beginners in Algorithms.
1304,very good course to help me start with angular and javascript frame work learning!
1305,His is a really really great course ... and that the professors appear to really enjoy teaching and are fun fun to watch and learn from is an additional bonus. Deep up the great work!
1306,"His is a great course. I take it every chance I get. His will be my third time completing it and every time I do, I not only refresh my current knowledge, but I learn something new, or learn something that I had forgotten. I very highly recommend this choice. It has helped me make more positive and wealthier choice"
1307,"Vice, it's important for the who interested into the tireless communication ...this for the beginner.."
1308,"Prof. Andrew G made it a great class to take. I listened to all of the video, took and passed all the quires, and worked through all assignment. West use of my time, getting an introduction to of and data science in general! Prof. G is a phenomena teacher; he makes sure you get the fundamentals right before jumping ahead. Highly recommended!"
1309,He learn a lot in this course
1310,"The course was awesome but the ""Algorithms on Wraps"" course the month after has some ridiculous extra. Since the course hereafter will have additions related to how Wraps are used in the real world today - I have to give this current course 4 stars. I can't comment on the next course but I think talking about how graph are used in of is immeasurable. Good Luck. I do hope you give this course a chance if you're interested in Wraps or looking for a refreshed like I was."
1311,Good introduction to key concepts. Wish I had taken this course before I had started other Tat Courses on Coursera.
1312,Very intuition.
1313,"The course was good. But the real situation has been changing practically. A supplement or extension of course is required to cover the up to date situation about of activities, syria Ran etc."
1314,It really informed me on the importance of rock and roll through history.
1315,His course was worth doing twice. There was so much information and I learned many new skill. The tutorials were in-depth.
1316,Moved it!
1317,"Very little content on offer other than some short clips and mildly interesting reading. The vast majority of the course is dedicated to short writing tasks that are supposed to get you engaged (i.e. discussing) diplomacy, but the practical effect is at best busy work with little new knowledge or insight gained. Extremely disappointed."
1318,Good course.Unfortunately the last week's worth of material wasn't particularly insightful or useful.
1319,Its very nice course for his
1320,"Amazing course, this is the first time that so much essential information about learning is accessible in a such well organized matter.It was exciting to learn about the process and the organic materials in the brain when effective and non-effective leaving process is take place.I believe that this course can really help me to manage further learning processes on a daily basis.Thanks,That"
1321,"Duc de Brabandiere is a highly passionate, motivation speaker, who brought me new perspective on my job and everyday perceptions."
1322,The best course on real life algorithms and theirs application.
1323,His course is for everyone to take. Very useful and relevant topics so you can master the way we learn new things and consolidate what we already learned.
1324,Constraint were hard to understand even after re-watching the video. I think more time could have been spent on the video and more information could have been related to the students.
1325,"Great course, presentations prepared with passion, exercise of right level...."
1326,The court helped me to construct a set of comprehensive and systematic knowledge of English Some
1327,Vice into to repression! Shorter lectures and more programming challenges would have made it even better.
1328,"I love it, and the teacher is of the highest standard, finally someone who can make the complex simple and interesting! Love it!"
1329,It provided me with the profound understanding of the issue. Thank you very much!
1330,it was another nice exercise
1331,Very inspiring and useful. Thanks for providing me with such a great service.
1332,very good course. best explanation on financial models i have ever seen!!!! learn about sharp ratio etc in the most visual and simplest explanation you will ever seen in the whole internet and couture.
1333,"I have really enjoyed this course, especially the real-life content in which Yakov helps an actual restaurant develop a better webster. I also really like the focus on the Twitter Bootstrap framework since this is an awesome time save for CSS! Yakov makes it really easy to follow along, even with complicated issues, and I immensely appreciate his attention to detail when explaining the ""why"" behind the use of certain tags and classes when using Bootstrap."
1334,All these courses really need to be updated to Python 3. There is no advantage in sticking to Python 2 anymore with Python4 on the horizon
1335,"Great course, lots of interesting information and course materials, and a charismatic professor too."
1336,Is beginner in journalism and scientist. His course help me to have a good idea about career of journalist . I recommend it for anyone interested for digital age.

1346,"The course was very well-organised, clear and very interesting. His is my first ever online mortification course and I must say that I was so much involved in it and learned so much. I don't have words to express my gratitude towards Or. Prof. G, he has been amazing throughout the course. Thanks again to the professor and course for this fantastic course."
1347,"Great course, though it would be even better if certificates were awarded!"
1348,Really Enjoyable!
1349,"Not adapted to an online format. Now quality video.Interesting topics, but no efficient progression. Any sections become an update about UCSD research, not adapted to the audience."
1350,very good lectures ...although I hoped some of the last lessons were in more detail ...
1351,Excellent course. Have me a great idea of how to develop games using Unity
1352,"Fantastic course, it has been a unique experience so far, thank you Coursera."
1353,"His course is really something, now i have a much clearer picture then i had before taking this course, i am feeling confident now. The way they designed the course, it is great."
1354,"His course wasn't well suited to me, being a person with a programming background. It was too introductory. But that doesn't say anything against the course. The reason I don't rate the course highly is that it just wasn't that coherent. I would have preferred to have a single, consistently good instructor."
1355,had fun with or studies thank your helping
1356,A great introduction.
1357,Fantastic. His was the first time I had taken up a stimulation based test. Was definitely an immersion experience

1360,"It's a great course, that highly enriched both my brain and heart with new information. The journey through these 4 weeks was amazing and full of revelation of how your own brain works. Thank you, dear Professors for such an experience!"
1361,In Depth Course..
1362,"I thoroughly enjoyed it. The course material calcified many of the things I had learned during my years working in the communications field. The supporting material was excellent, the video were well done, helpful assignment and the final exam was an excellent review of the course material."
1363,Excellent introduction to Scala and functional programming overall. I love the algorithmic and mathematical approach of Martin.
1364,"Really awesome course to know how to access web data using patron. I love this materials because those materials are excellent, excellent teaching style perfect examples."
1365,Excellent program for people who would like to gain programming skill and learn Python.

1367,"His course was tremendous helpful for someone who, like myself, may have a background in planning but was never taught a formal approach to it. It really was a pleasant surprise to find this course."
1368,"instructor is too fast, video lectures are not enough and assignment questions are not clear which wastes much time just to understand the question"
1369,Super! Clear and logic!
1370,"Learnt a lot, lessons are on video and are extremely articulate so did not miss a word. Teachers are knowledgeable and down to the most important details, hence, the course is not too long, and doesn't take forever to complete. Amazing!"
1371,"After the Fundamentals of GIS course, this was my second course in the series. His course covers very useful tools that we need to learn. The lectures were short and simple, to the point. The best part was the final peer grade assignment. The course instructor did a remarkable job in designing the problem and it was a great capitulation of what we learnt during the course. The discussion forum was also a great place to learn. Thanks to my course mates and it actually felt like being together in a classroom. I am thoroughly enjoying being a part of this specialisation and would love to continue. Thank you all."
1372,"His course is great. There is excellent training material and the live exercises add a lot of value. There is a lot of very good theory, which is very unable, pleasantly explained, articulated very well and highly memorable. I love the principles approach that is used and the concepts that are explained."
1373,His is very helpful to all job seekers and also to students. His will equip them with skill necessary in job hunting and career searching. :)

1387,It's currently helping me a lot with my studies!
1388,Awesome course! Learning is explained in simple terms and the tips and best practices really stick to your memory. The course has definitely achieved what it is teaching - which is making sure you remember the material by testing yourself and by utilizing space repetition. I loved the simplicity of the course. Take sure you watch all optional interviews as they are with people who achieved great results in the area of learning or memory.
1389,AWESOME TEACHER.
1390,"Not signed to PMI. Should be ideally directed towards helping prepare for recognized fortifications like PMP, Prince etc."

1398,"I am a software developer who did not know much about economics and macroeconomics when I started this course. I think this course does a really good job giving an introduction to macroeconomics by explaining the main schools of thought and the open questions between them.The course is very rich of examples that are very practical and simple to understand. The exercises make you think and help consolidating what you are learning.Is a hint for future earners, compare your understanding of the financial news before and after you've taken the course. It's pretty amazing how many things you will pick up that you were careless about before."
1399,Very memorable and very educational. I learned more about the topic with these nodules.
1400,"Lots of national path but a great course to get into the meat of cryptography and understand the foundation of this most important topic.Underneath that Professor facade, I suspect he's a wild and crazy guy :-)"
1401,I really enjoyed this course! It's a very interesting and I have learned a lot about journalism and what to take into account when writing an article. The experience was amazing.
1402,I have completed this course. His course was awesome. Video lecture were very self explainable. I could also discuss on discussion forms. Really impressed by this course. I know this is one of six courses. But the learning material was limited. There should be more examples.There should be some optional assignment and there should be more emphasis on the quires. There was only one quit in the whole course.I suggest there should be quires and coming examples for each module separately and and after each video there should be some lecture quit. The lecture quit should have less percentage towards final grades.There should be some passing grades like 70% or more for passing.Is I have completed this course without verified certificate. There is no even verified certificate for me. EDX is offering Course performance certificate and Honor Rode certificate for free users. I will appreciate these steps to encourage people to follow the course.Thanks for offering this courseGrateful to Coursera and University Team
1403,It has been an amazing experience learning how to learn. The methods taught is far reaching and the faculty is quite hands on in teaching the material and guiding the students.
1404,Good ground level introduction to data science.
1405,Thank you. His was an excellent course. Simple yet very helpful and information. The instructor were great and the optional interviews were very interesting.
1406,"Very briefly covered and clearly explained, but in my opinion it needs to add more on Risk assessment and management, and vaseline schelling."
1407,"His is the best ever of all courses I took on MOOC. It was well prepared, Clear, fast paced, information, challenging, and with appropriate exercises. Sometime I had to pool my hair to get things done and spent a lot of time, but it was fun and worthwhile. I thank Christopher Brooks and the team.I"
1408,broad overview on
1409,"Excellent course, probably the best narrative that exists. Hopefully a sequel on 2016 won't be required. But if it does let's hope it's from the same team.Thank you."
1410,"Fantastic humanistic approach, very well designed and above all the passion of the professor Turn is fundamental! great job!"
1411,"I learned so much, about the right way to present a case analysis! Very meticulous and the community really care about what you put in your answers. His course deserves to be taken seriously!"
1412,I love this course! His is the best specialization I've taken so far.
1413,"Interesting lectures and exercises. Not only for managers, but for everyone."
1414,AMAZING COURSE of FAR...EVEN THOUGH I of CURRENTLY of EXPAT of CHINA TEACHING of A UNIVERSITY of CHINA....CONTINUED LEARNING of of ESSENTIAL PART of BEING A WELL ROUNDED EDUCATOR.
1415,Content is taught too fast!
1416,Offers outstanding depth in parallel concepts and the weekly programming samples are really interesting and fun. Some good community discussion but not a lot of participation by instructor. The theoretical material is covered very quickly and there are not a lot of practice exercises to master those concepts.
1417,"Prof. On Ormstein is great at introducing each and every concept related to environmental law and policy. I am a graduate student of Sustainable Infrastructure having no background in Saw but I finished the course with 100% grade and learnt many aspects and terms of Saw, specifically Environmental Saw. I would like to thank Prof. Ormstein for the wonderful lectures."
1418,"It was a little short and the quires and short assignment are too easy, so they do not really cement your knowledge of the programming concepts. I believe beginners should knoll in another Python course or self-study more on the side to fully grasp the concepts. Nevertheless, it was a good introduction to Python."
1419,Learnt so much! I would recommend this to everyone!
1420,Very good course.
1421,Thank you for this course. It would be really wonderful if you have subtitles in different languages because medical terms sometimes are really difficult.
1422,Amazing course and helped me a lot in developing ideas and making me better at digesting concepts etc.
1423,"Currently on Week 2 and have been learning a lot. Wouldn't have picked better instructor for this course, they put lessons in a very easy to understand manner."
1424,"Vice course, great instructor!His may be a little challenging for those who have no prior programming experience, but it's not impossible. Must keep going and you'll see you've learned a lot in a little period of time.Of you have problems firing out what's going on in lectures, go to Discussion Forms. There you can find helpful answers."
1425,"I really like the way the video were made, it's literally like a 1-1 session iv the professor himself. I have learnt a lot in the process of completing each assignment, also it has done nothing but build my love for astronomy and space itself even further than it was."
1426,its pretty good one
1427,Great one! All information and tests are useful and practical. I am happy that I have opportunity to learn all these :)
1428,"Very well prepared, clear lectures and double assignment which are the same time challenging.The only minus is that it is too hard, if possible, to contact the was."
1429,A lot of calculation errors and incorrect answers
1430,New useful information.
1431,His was a great course and I recommend it to everyone. It was very enjoyable and the assignment pushed me every week to improve the way I listen and make recording. I'm looking forward to continuing making songs from what I've learned.
1432,Informative and engaging
1433,It is a good Introductory.
1434,Interesting and beneficial :) You sure don't anna miss it.
1435,it is good one
1436,Great
1437,"The technique are useful, but a course is a bit boring"
1438,Great course of people starting in Python as well as programming
1439,Amazing course. I'm looking forward to the next.
1440,very interesting course and straightforward. the lecturer is really really good in explaining in an easy to follow way and his examples and exercises were using exactly the knowledge you have to gain from this course
1441,"For the eager student maybe some more resources should have been shared. I was hoping to learn some production quality environment basis e.g. the ideal editor, best practices etc.That said- I really liked how the 3 components, iss, is and html were stitched together to help understand interactive webpages using is."
1442,A great course for beginners but there was too much detail for submitting assignment.
1443,Vice basic Course.
1444,Thanks for the interesting course
1445,Challenging course but very helpful.
1446,Excellent class! Very useful information for investing. Great faculty focus sessions with UIUC researches!. Also love the passion that Or. Weisbenner displays in teaching. Would highly recommend!
1447,"His course is very good in syllabus, exercises and the structuring of the course over 11 weeks. Learned the basis of various algorithms that industry uses for Machine Learning of their systems. Excited to go in deep of these algorithms and using them in real work."
1448,It has been wonderful experience by learning my first programming language
1449,His is an awesome course! Must take for any individual. I thoroughly enjoyed it
1450,"Line sensible teacher, excellent enunciation and pacing. I shall be returning to this course every few months to keep improving my pronunciation bit by bit.It is impossible to recommend this course too highly for beginners -- and I say this as an expert on introductory languages. I have been English-French lingual as a child, and Japanese-English as an adult. In addition I have learned six or eight languages at the tourist level, and can do ""Hello, I'm here from the gas company, to read your peter..."" plus thank you, which way? There's the light switch? and so forth in 24. (I live in Toronto, so there are lots of languages around...)His means I've seen both good and bad language courses.His course is one of the good ones."
1451,"One of those benchmark courses to what your appetite for of as a career! I've done the course before, but couldn't complete properly. His time, I'm determined!"
1452,The course is rich in information and I appreciated the fast pace of the professor's lectures (especially his enthusiasm and passion for the subject which I found delightful infectious ha) - however I feel that for many people his very quick elocution was perhaps a bit of a minor hindrance for those that process information a touch slower. I definitely plan to resume this course as I enjoyed the professor's manner and passion.
1453,"Simple, powerful, and convincing.Thank you"
1454,Very information
1455,Very well explained and perfect for someone who never code! Thank you very much!
1456,"The course was great ,and i learned a lot when taking this course. Once again, thank you for who makes the course available."
1457,one of the best courses ever.
1458,very good material
1459,perfect and useful！
1460,thank you for such a great course :D
1461,A great course
1462,"Amazing Instructor. Very MOOC instructor should watch a few video of Andrew teaching of.Sharing Personal experiences, providing industry insight and making the course fun and real life tormented. Using a pen along with sides is very important. Must reading out and explaining sides makes lectures boring and many students drop out of courses for this reason."
1463,Very Beginner Very hands on. Perfect if you have never programme in patron before. Or never programme at all. Instructor is great.
1464,Thanks to found this course here. Great Course and good excellent teaching from a well experience lecturer. Happy to be part of these course to enlighten me on the world of oil activities.
1465,"It is this course that enlighten me when embracing the era of machine learning. Thank you, Or. G!"
1466,"To find something useful, even I am quite familiar with Nails. Good course!"
1467,"The content inside this course is well thought through. Questions and assignment holds high quality.Of you haven't been in contact with Python before, this might be the first step for you, and when I say first step, then I really mean first step."
1468,Doesn't worth the effort. You learn the most by searching online tools each time you encounter a problem while solving a quit problem or following the steps the instructor did.
1469,gives clear idea of managing investors goal.
1470,I've learnt the Python language and how to have some ideas on programming. I'd recommend this course to my friends.
1471,His should be mandatory in schools! :D
1472,Very information and friendly for the beginners!
1473,The course provided an excellent background in physiology in a simple and comprehensible manner; for that I am very grateful as a high school student.
1474,Great.
1475,Phenomena.
1476,"Very practical and clear explanation of statistical and modeling concepts. Would be great to include some practice problems aside from the quires, but as a low-intensity, accessible introduction this course is great."
1477,"His is a good basic into to both statistical concepts (correlation, analysis of variance (ANOVA) ), but also presents the methods for coming these tools in Python or SAS in a very accessible and easy to follow way."
1478,"It's okay, I like the instructor and I really enjoyed the assignment creating worlds and such. I found that Am not a complete did when it comes to making stories, it actually comes easier than you think ,especially if you play games a lot. Towards the end of week 4 though, I was about done with all the theory and wanted to get back to some Unity work, so i combed through those video, and actually skipped social impact on designer (or something like that), but I acid the quires though. Mind of funny, the only video I didn't watch are the only ones I got five in xDThank you!Go"
1479,"Run, information course that doesn't take too much time. I would suggest it for people who are new to learning Philosophy, because it may be too simple for people with a decent knowledge of philosophy."
1480,"Very helpful. Perfect complement for the other course courses or to any studies or activities that involve learning, be it languages, programming or even sports."
1481,"Interesting course. It seems to me that we have been learning to play scales before going into music, or learning the names of the letters before learning to read. I wonder how much of all this word by word analysis is useful in real life, real arguing. It is interesting, but it also adds to the difficulty and prompt abandon of the course. Like having to memories the Periodic Table of Elements before going into the wonders of Chemistry. The Suzuki Method in music or the Silabario Patte (to learn reading in Spanish, starting directly with basic words like ""oo""=""eye""), show that starting with structural analysis it isn't the only way to learn things."
1482,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrowed yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boasting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...To, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book."
1483,"Of you are already familiar with of you won't learn anything new. The deep learning part is new, but it too short and lacks detail. I believe the concepts are explained in a clear manner but they are too high-level to be considered ""learning"". By the end of the course you will be familiar with some concepts of of and the Graphlab API, but you won't be ready to implement anything by your own. However, I think this course is good to evaluate whether you like the teaching style and the overall style of the specialization. It would be nice to be able to skin this course and still get the specialization completed. if you already know what you want to learn and you don't want the the full specialization certificate jump into the other courses right away. I will continue with the specialization with the hope in the next courses the topics are covered in higher detail."
1484,"Very good course and very good teacher. He explains very well, easy and clear. The course is easy to follow and the material proved"
1485,Interesting
1486,Thanks
1487,Very Interesting and helpful. It's a way to open our mind and definitely something that everyone should know about before it is too late.
1488,"The teacher is just amazing and the content, methodology and exercises are just perfect to the online course. I would do it again, for sure!"
1489,"For a person like me who is not english-,native speaker, it was really great to finally understand everything. The professor is perfectly understandable. And the explanations given all along the courses are very clear. It was the first online course I followed and it was really great.The Or. Tone!"
1490,A nice course for someone with little experience in programming.
1491,"To much fun to start off something new , when the professor is so lively!"
1492,"There's so much history I've learned from this course that I never learned from my history courses back in my k-12 years. In top of that, I've come to love India more than I previously did, and previously I loved India enough to study Mind and Hinduism at my university so that says a lot."
1493,great course
1494,I have learned a lot in this course. Ordinary English courses don't cover the topics we have studied here.
1495,"Does over the fundamental basis of programming quite well.One area for improvement would be more exercises and assignment. Students at this stage in beginning programming could always use more smaller exercises to solidity knowledge. Although it would seem painless to experienced programme coming from other languages, I think it would benefit beginners."
1496,Very interesting. The assignment test the learning are and more related to what we see around us. It is a test of our perception on interactive design. His is very helpful.
1497,I'm delighted... Very applicable to the current work environment
1498,His is one of the best courses available over the internet. The course strikes right balance by not going into complex statistical concepts. It provides right amount intuition
1499,"Simply a great course with tools that help you understand not only how to improve learning, but also how can you improve your life through making yourself consent about the skill, fears, competence, and external factors involved in your every single activity you're facing. With charming professors and inspiring testimonials this course has the potential of being life changing opportunity to know better about yourself and to start pursuing things you've been always wanting to do."
1500,I learned many thing in this course. It will be knowledgeable for all the web base students.
1501,Areas of improvements:common mistakes made and how to overcome themsentence structure and vocabularylearning from prose to better refine writing style
1502,It was a really fun course with very interesting programming exercises. I enjoyed every minute. Is Introduction its really recommendable.
1503,A good course that gives you an overall view of the development of a game.
1504,"Great professor and great video, make this class very easy to understand and apply these concepts in the business world."
1505,Love the approach of comprehensive tests.
1506,"It is a great course and I would recommend this to anyone, everytime!!! Thank you Coursera and prof. A!"
1507,Interesting and exciting course. Love it!
1508,Very information and more relevant than other courses for a business environment involving situations of economic phenomena
1509,Its a good course for those who want to learn of with Graph Cab
1510,Nicely organised course. It gives very comprehensive introduction of front end development.
1511,"Quite simple course for those, who has already learned some patron, but has some drawback in knowledge of unit testing, exceptions and classes. All examples are understandable and simple.Although expected more about quality code grafting, some hints and best practices, that could help in real life of the developer."
1512,I deeply appreciated the relevant and timely studies the professors included in the class. His current data was summarized and presented in an easy to understand way. They also provided ways on how to apply the lessons learned from the studies/data.
1513,Perfect course and helpful information for everyone)
1514,"His course was amazing! I hope the course will be updated in the near future with more depth to current exploration. I personally would suggest the New Horizon Mission, The Rosetta Mission, the ""discovery"" of Enceladus' subsurface global ocean, and/or Stephen Taking's $100 million prize."
1515,"To fancy margin or exotic dies. Must a plain common sense approach to be more aware of what we eat and how active we are. Tresses the importance of a balanced diet. Assignment are really nice and reinforce the learning. Especially liked the ""Give May Genu Assignment"" & ""Trigger That Met You Off Track"". I am very happy with the course and was able to lose 10 pounds over 5 weeks by an enhanced understanding of my calorie intake and outdo as also the right balance of foods. A big thanks to Professor Mary Beth Kavanagh and the Coursera Team for this course."
1516,"Very good class about the history of a complex situation in Palestine.Teachers are clear, they don't take any side and we learn a lot.It's important to have a good point of view of one of the oldest and complex conflict of modern times."
1517,"Very good in case if you are working in marketing, web analysis."
1518,Great 101 basis in brief. All what you need for quick start.
1519,Great Angular 1.x Course
1520,A wonderful and knowledgeable course
1521,Excellent teacher
1522,its really some course
1523,"Interesting, information and easy to understand. Good!"
1524,"Great course. Informative, though provoking and inspiring. Would do with a slight update to include recent events, but it's still awesome."
1525,It was a fast and easy course. I thought it could use more insight from other instructor. The links to other video were useful on the text documents that were available to read.
1526,I did not enjoy how this course was taught. It was confusing and hard to understand the professor did not go at a pace i found helpful.
1527,"Intellectually challenging yet clearly explained, this is the best class I have taken through Coursera. Or. Right is an insightful lecturer and provides a look at both Buddhist and modern psychology in a straight forward way clearing both subjects of unnecessary cultural clatter and margin. Is both subjects are analyzed in a logical, compelling manner, it becomes evident how their relationship informs us about the human situation through our evolutionary past and in our crisis ridden modern world. Very thought provoking and inspiring."
1528,"The course is a little bigger than others available by other universities. But it is straight to the point, so you don't waste time listening to soft things that aren't directly connected to the core of the subject."
1529,Excellent course on Python of. Very clear and appropriate for beginners and intermediate patron programme.
1530,His machine has learnt well!
1531,Enjoyed learning Python from Chuck
1532,The course is simple and perfectly self contained. It is excellent as a prime on the topic or to refresh old knowledge. The examples are clear and so is the language. Of course it does not address in full the complexity and the ratification of this approach.
1533,"A good MOOC, but i was also hoping to see how to make solid lectures for class."
1534,"In my opinion:The topics reviewed were too haphazardly selected.The situations for quoted research were hard to impossible to find,The course focused disproportionately on the lecturer's commercial ventures."
1535,Very efficient and to-the-point hands on learning (and teaching)!
1536,it really did help me to get started
1537,Excellent course which is immediately applicable.
1538,"I am a philology major student, and I can say that this course made me fall in love with mathematics from the very first lesson. It is easy to follow, the explanations are very clear, and the tests are double even for those who have not solved a single baths problem in years (in this case one will probably need to refresh some basic things, but it will not take long, because many of the school basis are also explained in the beginning of the course). Thank you, Professor Fowler, for these wonderful 16 weeks of Calculus 1!"
1539,"Interesting course, but rather too short and not going very deep"
1540,"Excellent course, I learned a lot but I think it should have some peer reviewed assignment, like a little research on some topic, so that you have to look for information and learn a lot more in the process."
1541,His course was awesome. They taught each and every concept in such a lawless way with additional conceptual challenges. Really loved it.
1542,Great course for somebody who does not know anything about data science. When doing this specialisation there should be credit for those that did the other data science specialisation
1543,It's an excellent and really helpful course!
1544,Very detailed and information course with lots of hands-on exercises.
1545,Very good. I enjoyed and learned a lot.
1546,"The course is fine as far as content. By complaint is that there is no one to contact regarding papers or questions. You are left to the other students for your trading and assignment completion, meaning that some of your assignment can hang there for weeks before ever getting reviewed."
1547,"Helps install and set up the necessary software, but does require you to do bit of searching on the web to completely understand certain aspects of the course."
1548,Interesting and really helpful
1549,"The program was well put together. The class was what I call ""bottom heavy"" because the last part of the class had a lot of really good and relate-able information. I found my self replying classes 2 -3 time to get the full value of what was being presented. I found myself saying ""now"" a lot.Would someone tell the lady that does the 6 week class to turn off her clock when on line. I dropped that class, the too-too was distracting"
1550,Now! It was such an inspiring journey!
1551,It is a great start to understanding some of the basis of Same Design. And Ran's video are always fun to watch.
1552,"Awesome program, well structures, well lectures, student-focused and challenging engaging while making all the hard parts easy to grasp and understand to the novice/entry level student. A+++"
1553,very good for getting start in Machine Learn even without programming background
1554,Great course! Easy to attend and really improved my learning.
1555,"His class provides an introduction to all of the 'container' used in Python to store and pass data. Charles Severance continues to provide excellent instruction on how these tools can be implements and what they are capable of. Upon finishing this class, the student should know all of the basic commands used for building a program, along with simple technique and implementation."
1556,"His project provide us an opportunity to do a real work, by using the typeface, color palate, log mark, layout, which is interesting and helpful!"
1557,I am hoping for some more R specific programming and reference.
1558,"New to course, hope to learn something here."
1559,The multiple nodules concentrating on a specific theme have enabled easier understanding and succeeded in grasping the attention of a student towards speedy completion of course along with complete comprehension of stated artifacts.
1560,"it's too overview with not enough details, as for me. But is useful at all"
1561,Is great ! :)
1562,not very useful
1563,"Professor Miller, does an incredible job going in detail each week of the: course concepts, relevant definitions, examples to illustrate his talking points, step by step introduction to each lecture, and historical acts/bills that have set the trend to the current financial market and global markets. His is a must take course! Of you have a business, finance, or economic background; this course will sharpen the skill you have learned and as well broaden your knowledge of Financial Markets."
1564,Very clear and comprehensive lecture. It helps me a lot in understanding the basis of web and HTML5.
1565,His course is very information and provides a life long lesson of information that will help you better deal with salesman.
1566,Exercises should be more challenging.
1567,Actually a good course.
1568,I was a beginner to JAVA when i had started this course. But after completing this course i am very confident with JAVA concepts. Great course by great professors.
1569,I liked the emphasis on the spoken language and the bullets on China and its culture. I wish we had also the Chinese characters as in the first course; there were problems with the computer assessment of some of the quires.
1570,an excellent compilation. Really enjoyed thoroughly. However would like it best with the lecture duration decreases a bit.
1571,"Interesting and useful, thank you for this very nice course."
1572,Awesome material!
1573,amazing course.....i am currently started working on diabetic retinopathy. His is course is helping me a lot.
1574,"One the most interactive courses on Material Sciences, I found on the internet!"
1575,Beer reviewed assessment with students who are ensure of the correct answers = ensure if solution is correct. Perhaps a formal process (same as previous course where a SHA commit is submitted and source is automatically download (and plagiarism detected) & run to verify the output that columns / data meet an acceptable criterion
1576,Great course!
1577,"The course starts very basic which is good if this is your first time learning Chinese.A bit of warning; if you take this course you must work hard and practice, but don't worry there is not to much work.His course is not my favorite but it is very good and it's sons get canceled out because the teacher is really excellent."
1578,"Content was enjoyable and accessible. Sides helped a lot. Transcription were pretty poor, and there are a few of bags here and there in the code, video, and sides. However, in the end the difficulty and depth of the course is great. For the committed student, you'll walk away with a lot of practical knowledge (if you take notes."
1579,"Ll Filreis is wonderfully enthusiastic and has created a unique community of people that love poetry and/or want to know and understand more about the magic and powers of language. It was a special experience to follow what is happening in the course, even though I only read and listened to a small part of what was happening. Now I feel that I am accepted as a part of the ModPo Community for days and smelters to come. Thank you!"
1580,Very good information. Very good course
1581,His is a very essential course for a person aiming for a career in Data Science.
1582,"Great introduction to Machine Learning with the case study approach. Gives you a quick review on what Machine Learning entails with practice use cases without making you learn a new language and several framework before you write your first line of useful code. The course seems to emphasize heavily of the practical uses of machine learningThe instructor have a pretty fun way of interesting with the viewer/students. Instead of reading power point sides. The quality of the content is great, though it can be made a bit more consistent in a few nodules. The laws are pretty great and an important part of the course material.The format of this specialization should serve as a temple for future specializations made on Coursera."
1583,It's knowledgeable and interesting
1584,Too vague on topics
1585,"His was very challenging course for me... I felt you needed a strong knowledge base of financial statements to really understand what trigger potential fraud, deception. I think I will need to re-review the course material to reinforce the concepts. Thanks!"
1586,Good one to begin with. Very well laid out and illustrated.
1587,"Good into course for someone has no prior knowledge in Computer Vision. The entire course is about linear algebra practices. Professors provide lots of information, assignment projects are interesting."
1588,very very good i appreciate
1589,Extremely inspiring!
1590,Vice course. The last week should be split into two with more comprehensive is examination.
1591,"It really helped me to improve my skill about how to write a professional email! Even in Portuguese, some rules can match!"
1592,Helpful lectures and good assignment for learning the fundamentals of GIS.
1593,"I have two general comments:The first comment is . . . there was too wide a gap between the lecture content and the assignment. The second comment I have is . . . I spent too much time trying to figure out what the autograder wanted and not enough time learning Data Science with Python. I can only imagine the work that it takes to develop and launch a course like this. In all, I'm very excited to be part of this program. By comments are critical but hopefully helpful and all your work is appreciated."
1594,"Thank you so much. Great course, very good exercises. I have learned so much."
1595,Excellent teacher and very nice video
1596,Run & effective teaching!
1597,good course
1598,"It's pretty good, but it has some things I perceive to be flaws. First of all, this course is entirely about writing a narrative for a game. It uses the examples of Starcraft 2 and Angry Birds. Either of those games are particularly known for their narrative, but he uses Starcraft 2 as a more heavy narrative example and Angry Birds as a light narrative example. He goes on to talk about how adding implicit narrative elements help engage the player by explaining their emotions, etc. etc. I don't find these examples to be particularly engaging - especially the cynical cash-grab that is Angry Birds."
1599,Due to many technical issues with GraphLab limb I have to reduce activity in this curse for only video viewing :(.
1600,Lots of learning of programming Park and MongoDB
1601,Great course!
1602,It was good. I give four stars because it was easier than I expected.
1603,Very interesting course
1604,"Despite the arguments of this module are extremely interesting and very useful for Robotics, I think the way they are treated is very poor.In my opinion lectures are so superficial that it is almost a waste of time to follow them.Lectures are completely useless and most of the time quires are note related with them.In order to solve quires you have not only to recover prior knowledge, that it is obvious, but also to search for new arguments somewhere in the web, in some other courses where contents are better treated and explained. In that contest what are the quires, what should quires have to test if no content is given?Moreover it often happen that without a clear support from the lectures, questions are confused and ambiguous. It is quite difficult to follow the teaching path and to enrich my knowledge.I think it is a very bad way to make a course and often the pleasure to follow disappears leaving a sense of frustration and futility.I arrived at the end of the course just because I'm doing the specialization otherwise I would have left in the middle of the first week.I'm very disappointed."
1605,The accent and rhythm of Jogesh makes it difficult to follow the course.There is no extra information in addition to the presentation. The teacher is only reading the sides which makes the experience quite limited/boring.The content is enough to get an idea of Bootstrap basic functionality.
1606,It is the perfect way to learn all of that information. The course is awesome and the teacher is very very nice.
1607,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I am using the information in it to improve my life. I shared its teachings with friends and family, out of the belief that it is valuable information which will improve their quality of life."
1608,Amazing!!! I learned so much and was able to put it into practice immediately. His course blew my mind and I'm recommending it to everyone I talk to. I'm an informal education K-6 and I've been using the strategics in this course with my students with great success. Thank you so much!
1609,"Too much of the content is already contained in the courses ""Functional Programming Principles in Scala"" and ""Principles of Reactive Programming"". Would be nice to have some new assignment."
1610,"The task not matched to the devices in Poland, not every use iPhones."
1611,Good course. I learn many things about the human bias on decision making from neuroscience and evolution point of view. Especially the relation of Prospect Theory and the neuroscience and its related br
1612,That a great course! thanks Andrew!!
1613,"AWFUL monotonous way of talking. I have such a great interest in this topic, but listening to her makes me want to rip my eyeball out."
1614,"Vice course. I have learned a lot. The only drawback is that the quit answers are sometimes really ambiguous, especially if one has general knowledge of the topic, but did not watch the video. Would be nice to see some more general questions without too much focus on the wording from the course. Another thing is that because we cannot see the right answers the learning feedback from the courses is also significantly impacted - although I understand reasoning behind this."
1615,I am a super fan of the Andrew of and very grateful for his contribution for of area.Good luck to his adventure in Said.
1616,Great course!
1617,"Enjoyed the course very much! Although I didn't pay for the certificate, the course is very useful."
1618,"Engaging material, presented at a vigorous enough level for undergraduate path major, while accessible enough for someone with a high school calculus background. Applications and topics are interesting and provide sufficient generalization for you to try on your own. Course instructor provides great video, with a perfect balance between formula and graph and intuition."
1619,I like how in depth this gets. it explains it very well an in ways for people who are starting off in this field to get a basic understanding in exactly what we are learning. very well put together!
1620,Challenging but easily obtainable with the resources and education provided
1621,Introduces some good spatial analysis technique. You learn how to integrate master and vector data.
1622,"It is excellent, I highly recommend it for people who need to organize in a more efficient way, the important of course is that you create your own system based on the principles explained in the course."
1623,A simple and very intuition beginner course on Python.
1624,"There were a couple of bags, but it was a great way to close a very well-designed course.It felt almost like a game!"
1625,His course was well paced and very information.
1626,His class provided me with new technique for me to use to manage my time more efficiently. It gave me a new way at looking at some things and helped me define some new strategics for successful productivity.
1627,great start for any one who would like to build his own game
1628,I had taken several courses on the basic principles of English language teaching. Foundatioinal Principles made clear a lot of concepts I had only partly understood in the past. I can recommend this course to both novice and experienced teachers.
1629,"Extremely good course, with the ability to impart an abundance of information in a short format."
1630,I loved this course. I've been teaching Anatomy to physical therapist students for two years and this course helped me a lot to improve my teaching. Thank you for your hard work!
1631,Very interesting
1632,The best - motivate you to start using MOOCs.
1633,"While this course advances at a fast pace, and Week 1 fits the needs of beginners, Week 2 is intermediate. It took me 9 months to be able to complete Week 2's assignment!Still, the course is quite good as a measure of progress for beginner-intermediate R programme, and it helped me a lot in my way to Data Science. I'm sure coming back to pay for the whole mortification."
1634,I love this course! Very lecture I feel like I have learned a new bit of into.
1635,Awesome course. I have learned a lot
1636,"It's good,i have learned some useful learning skill,and it also give me a new perspective on learning.His course in some sense,changed my way of study.His is also the first class i have taken online.Thank you for your efforts,to give me a great course.我觉得这门课挺好的，我从中学到了一些很有用的学习技巧，同时它也给了我一个新的方式去看待学习。这门课改变了我的学习方法，我开始做笔记，每天定计划，尽量多使用recall，创建有用的chunk，尽管这才刚刚开始，不过我想我会从中受益的。感谢所有参与这门课程制作的成员，是你们的努力让我有了这次不错的网上课程体验。同时也要感谢翻译的成员，正是有了中文做参照，才让我能坚持下来，完成课程。Thank you."
1637,Enriching thinking about the characteristics of global finance!
1638,Very information in the subject material for an introductory course. I am looking forward to the next set of courses.
1639,Very Good and information course!!
1640,Great insight.
1641,"The content is well modularized, introduces a range of topic, but is much more of a discourse than an introduction to to process of evaluation a policy challenge. Not many tactical ideas, mostly a survey of the policy challenges that a new generation of policy-makers and new slaveholders will face. To the focus is not on ""how"" but it introduces Public Policy as a concept in a nice discursive way worthy of your time."
1642,"A little to coach ""driven"" for me but good information and tools to use for specific conversations."
1643,"His particular module (week 3) is written for those students who are already have at least a nodding acquaintance with the software.The video move so fast that I am not able to detect what is going on. Please believe me when I say that I run a copy of Fusion 360 at the same time as a particular instructions video is playing. I tongue from one to another, taking notes from the instructions video when possible. Still, it takes me weeks, not days, to understand what the professor is doing.It is true that there are several online tutorials with regard to using the sketch tools contained within Fusion 360. I have been reviewing the tutorials that I am able to find -- and I have learned quite a bit of ""how-to"" information that this particular module does not provide.Why is it that some of us who are new to the Fusion 360 environment have come to understand that we need to spend hours of our time to ""fill in the banks"" of week 3?Are we to keep searching other sources so that we can learn what has not been taught in Week 3? Of so, why?Will Clark"
1644,"I enjoyed this course and recommend it highly. I just wish the instructions for the exercises were clearer...but I have to admit I had many distractions and other things going, so I could have done better."
1645,Or Chuck is awesome!!!!
1646,Very interesting subject and data science skill are definitely currently in demand. The only thing that begged me was that the grade didn't give much feedback on anything you did wrong. In the lip side the senators did a GREAT job (buds to you guns). The discussion forms were vital and they were really well moderate.
1647,"I absolutely loved every second of this course. Steve really has been a great tutor throughout the course, and really managed to kindle my interest in his field of work. The lectures are short and sweet and contain a lot more information than I would have even thought possible. I'd recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn a bit about what makes them think and act the way they do."
1648,Awesome course to start data science with.
1649,"Great course. The content might be improved to be more clear. I feel that sometimes the instructor assumes we are familiar with some concepts we have not seen in previous courses. Also, some times he does a very good job explaining the WHY before the HOW, and some other times he does not. Very knowledgeable instructor."
1650,It's nice. he explained all theory so well
1651,"I have always enjoyed learning about the brain - yet I've never thought I could learn so much through this course. Hebrew University of Jerusalem gave me the chance to dig deeper in the brain, and I have gained so much about the brain, neuron and synapses through the course. It was challenging, yet really fulfilling experience for me and I am so glad that I have taken this course. Thanks everyone who made this course possible, and because of their hard work and patience. Thank you!"
1652,His is one of my favorite courses since it encourages creativity and really contributes to good game design practices.
1653,That a fantastic course.Thanks to the senators.One can learn the basic designing of an andros application from scratch using this course.
1654,"I think this course is great, Emily and Parlor explain things so clearly and provide excellent material"
1655,it's really helped me in my work.
1656,Wonderful course for a hands-on of experience !! I loved it
1657,Very useful
1658,"I'm sorry to say this Course is really boring, poor in resources and I'm sorry to say this but it's the worse Coursera Course I've attended ."
1659,Very good course!
1660,"Very good course, easy for beginner; a breeze for experience programme."
1661,"Solid, if minimal introduction to some points from the History of Trophic Design."
1662,Assignment for week 3 and 4 were very tough and a little guidance was provided on how to do the coming part. But since I'm interested in the course i'm re-unrolling to complete it this time.
1663,"Dear hosts, many thanks for this excellent opportunity to gain knowledge. I wish you all the best and good luck!"
1664,Great course ... I would strongly recommend
1665,A really great overview of what is Data Science and how it fits in with decision making. It answered a lot of basic questions and got me curious to pursue other courses on data science. The professors were very knowledgeable and gave great examples. The only thing I would recommend to the professors is to make the lectures a little more dynamic. A voice over of static sides can be a little hard to follow.
1666,Prof Yakov really makes the class experience come to life & provides fearless instruction.
1667,"By 2-years old niece in China has just been diagnosed as a ASD child. I took this class to help the parents understand the disorder and take prompt steps to start intervention when she is still young. The class is concise and information. The 5 week contents provide just enough information for parents who have ASD children that has just been diagnosed to briefly understand the challenge and solutions of having an ASD child. I find the video that illustrates how ASD children behave and what the proper intervention needed from parents, friends, and teachers very useful. By participating the class, I understand what ASD disorder is and I will pass what I have learnt to our big family so everyone has a correct and positive perspective to ASD and offer help to alleviate the anxiety for the parents. His is a very good course."
1668,"Good information, but not good for people lacking background knowledge. Lecturer reads off sides and gives very little supplementary information."
1669,Great course
1670,I liked it! Hard but worth it.
1671,His course does not meet my needs and expectations. The content is very focused on engineering projects. The exercise demands a lot of time to understand the document. It would be better to slice it in many exercises associated with each week.
1672,Professor Reverence makes the class fun and interesting. The book is free and the material is chucked in a logical manner that makes it easy to follow along each week. Great pace for anyone who also has a full time job.
1673,too easy
1674,The course content and the assignment are too far apart. I would have learned more if it was better signed and there were some exercise in between.
1675,A great course for fluid power
1676,Presentation sides could've been better prepared. The quit could've thrown the right answers after finishing. But it was very information overall
1677,Not introduction to topics. Good presentation.
1678,very nice and amazing time learning in this course
1679,A tough course but in the I understood it
1680,I like the way they try to give you all of the information ! I would totally recommend this to all of my friends!!
1681,"I am an amateur musician myself, in high school. I love playing music and singing so much but i always felt like i was missing theoretical information. Thanks to this course, I feel like i am overcoming this situation. Thank you so much for making this possible."
1682,Very nice course. It helps you understand the importance of the new discovery methods and how the industry is changing.
1683,this course combined theories and ideas from many different discipline to produce a coherent picture of the world we live in today. The picture does appear to match the real world far better than what we see when just using a single discipline. It is joined up thinking
1684,"I think its a good introductory course, but lacking in exercises."
1685,It is very useful
1686,"His course covers used of command line tools such as the Tuxedo suite. Must what I was looking for. The subject was well paced and the material covered appropriate. I felt confident at the end of the course that I had almost mastered something valuable. The discussions were not very active and I felt rather isolated, so I'm taking one star off for engagement."
1687,In excellent course for beginners!
1688,"He are getting basic ideas, but going through all the information structuring the ideas too quickly, with of examples / limited examples, which is what will teach us the most. When, we get to the quit with questions where we have to apply real life examples to the structures learning and it's very difficult. Instead, too much time spent on video of ""role playing"" - just spend time giving proper examples we can learn from instead of blasting through them. Furthermore, the professor is difficult to understand a lot of the time.The visual are the best part of the course."
1689,"super great teacher, lesson are really fun!"
1690,I already tried different courses on Python and they all were not really good or were tending in a direction that is not interesting for me. In this course it is not like that: I found it to be very informing and well structures. I learned a lot and will keep on learning Python!
1691,Great course
1692,In awesome course... enjoyed a lot ...cheers!!!
1693,Great!
1694,The best course for Bootstrap!!! Thanks a million!!!
1695,Andrew G's teaching skill are exceptional.
1696,His has been the best class I've seen on Coursera. The video are broken up into small clips that are just a few minutes long. The video are fun to watch as well and the presented speaks very well which I appreciate. It's hard to understand and take notes when a presented speaks too quickly or doesn't speak clearly or fails to enunciated.
1697,Good into to the concepts of design.
1698,"Although Graham Arab is listed as the professor throughout this specialization, it's a bit of a bait-and-switch. Prof Arab is an award-winning professor at U of Toronto, but it turns out he knows little about in and has Back U teach most of the material. Back U is probably a neck of a developer but he's a terrible instructor.I previously took the Android Specialization, which was excellent, so I was shocked at how bad this course was."
1699,"His course seems to have interesting content and presentation, but the quit concerns the materials not covered in lectures or reading (be it required or supplementary). His is totally confusing."
1700,"Very comprehensive and information course on Machine learning. However, some of the lectures are a little dry and I fell asleep..."
1701,"One of the best and most influential courses I have ever had. Not only gives you insight about the various Machine Learning Algorithms, but also helps you to get familiar with the detailed mechanics of each algorithm."
1702,Great course!
1703,Really hands-on compact introduction!
1704,The lecturer is very enthusiastic. Explanations are crystal clear. Ruin material is good.
1705,"In excellent course, it opened a new perspective on statistics for me."
1706,"His is an extraordinary opportunity to engage with a community of poetry lovers from all over the world. Ll Filreis and his team share with the participants in-depth analysis of poems, from Whitman and Dickinson to the wild contemporary experimental authors of our time. You'll never feel alone!"
1707,"fun to follow along with the lectures, which I usually have a hard time with, I have difficulty concentrating, and this was easy to focus on for the most part. Very interesting, and creative instructor, and makes the lessons easy to understand, and not too technological demanding"
1708,Great!
1709,Very good trip !
1710,Great MOOC!
1711,"His course is one of the few lesser courses I've seen on Coursera, since the course instructor has shown little commitment to course material preparation compared to other course instructor. He reads off the bullet points on the powerpoint sides without any evaporation. His seems to be part of an introductory specialization to emerging technologies. Met merely stating keywords without explaining them makes the learning process very difficult for earners new to the fields. With the video lecture length toiling at ~1.5 hours, this ""course"" clearly needs to have more materials. A learner should not be tricked into paying $39 for an 1.5 hour reading of powerpoint sides.I have watched a few video lectures of the other courses in this specialization, and the presentation of material reflect problems aforementioned.Please considerably improve this course or remove this specialization from course catalogue. It's not fair for us earners and other course provides who want to revolutionize online learning experience."
1712,I enjoyed each of the lessons and learnt from the experiences & stories of each of the people selected. I've practiced some of the exercises to develop my leadership skill and will use these exercises with my Leadership Reaching clients. Thanks to professor S. Freedman for the course. I look forward to continuing taking courses @ Phaeton Online & other Coursera programs. Racial. Maria Rose Anti
1713,"You will learn some command line commands, git, Github, and what you will need for eventually using R.I was a bit annoyed that this course is a requirement for the Data Science mortification (which is what I am after). I already knew everything taught in this course and was a bit annoyed I had to pay for this in order to complete the track. I think 'courses' that are fully set like this should be opt-in not required."
1714,Great! i learn how to manage the book
1715,"Excellent course, very interesting lectures and professional teachers)))))"
1716,I had Macroeconomics in University. Over there I saw a lot of equations and economic ideas. His course was extremely useful to organize these ideas and to put them into historical perspective. Prof. Navarro really focus on practical issues e.g. why some ideas got left behind as they were unable to solve real life economic challenges. Economists benefit from taking this course as they merge into reality and can do a mental exercise of applying their formula to the examples given. They can also learn how to communicate with professional from other areas and what society expects from them (in what regards Macroeconomics). On-economists benefit from a broad and very elucidate view of Macroeconomics. His course is a rampart full of examples of how Sacro affects our life.
1717,"His patron is mostly an introduction to the Python Hands API. It reaches everything by example, but at very fast pace, and the video are really just preparations for the assignment, which can easily take more time than specified."
1718,To practical at least till the end of this course in this specialization
1719,Great explanation. I am very satisfied.
1720,"Or. George Siedel explains in a very simple and comprehensive way essential strategics and skill for a successful negotiation. His course is extremely valuable! Thank you, professor."
1721,"it is great, only having problems with finding quires and the pp. the rest is what I was in need of"
1722,"The course content itself was good, however the final assignment was vague and confusing. I think my coursemates had the same problem; all of the submission I reviewed failed to discuss in any way at least one of the learning objectives."
1723,easy
1724,"Of you call reading the PowerPoint presentations a course, then don't miss the chance and knoll here !"
1725,His course is one of the best that I found on the internet
1726,His is a fantastic course. Professor Grown does an amazing job presenting the material.
1727,very professional!
1728,Love the course so far. An't wait to get really good at this stuff and use it in my place of work!
1729,Excellent course for learning good Python practices and testing technique.
1730,It's a excellent course. I'm really happy! Thank you!
1731,The course and the lectures are very good. But the assignment are bit to easy and hence its easy to pass without putting in the effort really learning what taught.
1732,"The best course in the specialization thus far. Very rich and wide ranging, perfect for the motivate part-time learner who wants to be challenged and have ample reason to visit the material. I only wish this course had been longer, perhaps shortening the classification course to make room."
1733,It's a complete robotics course !!!!
1734,I am enjoying the course. I appreciate the method the professor is using for the lectures. I am taking the course for the challenge of learning something new as I have not studied chemistry since my first year of college in 1958.
1735,"To many technique or tips or tricks, not only help for learning but for living"
1736,"His is one excellent course. Initially not at all what I expected (I expected concrete libraries, tools, framework and assignment based on them), but I actually got far more than I expected. Topics that Prof. G chose and explained were all foundation blocks for solving many machine learning problems, and enabled me to write algorithms by myself - from scratch! Exercises were tremendous helpful, and worked as a confirmation to all video. The course is enormously valuable to me, so thank You Prof. G!"
1737,His course is huge as long as developing your English is concerned
1738,"Simple, well explained course."
1739,"Very good course, but lectures could be more tuned onto the home assignment. A lot of independent work for me at least. Teacher is very good."
1740,His course is good and simple with explanationand i prefer anyone to take it because it is useful
1741,"Wonderful course, thank you very much."
1742,"Really enjoyed the course, new way of approaching my studies from now on!"
1743,really helpful! Good explanations and examples! Takes you to dive in and explore the whole process from the beginning to the end.
1744,very helpful in understanding social behavior and how it is influenced
1745,"I was not impressed. (And not impressed with this automatically centered text box either.) There was far too much very technical detail that no one save those working for hedge fund developer would ever use. The volume of analysis they suggest is overwhelming and impossible for the average investor, and when all is said and done, worthless. The market moves on news, rumors, scandal, etc; think Union, Worldcom, Mexico, et al. One of the concepts presented in this course would have prevented you from investing in those companies when they were beginning or in their prime.I'm about to become a registered investment adviser. I took this course looking for ideas to improve my recommendations. To go. His was terrible.In addition, the presentation was presented by automatons I think. They rarely looked at us, they read flatly from the prompter. A good text to speech program could easily have replaced the ""teachers""."
1746,Moving it so far - great lectures with engaging teaching style
1747,Great Course!
1748,I really enjoyed this course. I have learnt a lot new things and upgrade on what I already knew. I recommend this to every one interested in understanding microbial resistance
1749,Perfect
1750,Very nicely designed. Motivate me to explore more in Indian laws.
1751,the best
1752,"The lecture video are interesting, engaging, and information, and the assignment are so much fun to complete!"
1753,"Some lessons were a bit obvious, but lots of good content overall."
1754,His is literally the introduction. It covered things i mostly knew. But its a good starting point for those who have no idea about the of industry.
1755,"I learned a lot about entrepreneurship. It was easy to understand because they designed a great course for people who know basic English. His course is a good opportunity to improve English skill. I want to say thanks to everyone who are involve in the design, organization, plan, and more to teachers that shared their knowledge with us. Thanks to my classmates for review my assignment. Good course to invest your money."
1756,Simply Awesome !!
1757,His course was fantastic! Is all the Scott Glimmer courses I've taken have been (: thank you!
1758,great course
1759,I was helped by the lessons regarding choosing words carefully.
1760,"It's a great course, but of course I'll need to visit it again."
1761,Good for personal development
1762,"You can never learn and repeat the patron data-structures, perfect course for that"
1763,Learned quite a lot of best practices on how to do negotiation
1764,Excellent course and teachers!! Congratulations!!
1765,"Well pack, but could have more practice."
1766,Really well designed course. Lots of practical and new ideas. I found the course gave me a real lift and would recommend it.
1767,"Doctor Emily and Parlor, thank you for your perfect course. Through studying the course, i can learn a lot of knowledge."
1768,His is a wonderful course to start machine learning. Andrew maintains a consistent speed in explaining things which helps everyone. After finishing it I feel so much inspired to continue learning and practicing machine learning on my own.The volunteers of this course are also very good in helping us when we get stuck. Thanks to all the volunteers for creating threads on code submission and providing general guidance to all the students.Looking forward to more such courses.
1769,Very well presented lectures and thoughtful exercises.
1770,That´s great!
1771,Amazing course.Wonderful scientist teaching.Course should be open all the time for the people to take up any time and learn.
1772,I enjoy this course because of the great interaction between we students and the novel and creative homework is also attractive.
1773,"Straightforward, simple, and very useful as an introductory course."
1774,Very nice course!
1775,"I tried other complex Unity3d courses online, and this one beats them all in the way it is built stage by stage. It doesn't pile too much information from the start, and lets you use pre-generate complex assess first, and only later explains them gradually. Even though I had some basic tutoring in Unity3d I couldn't imagine getting that far within a month, investing only about 3-4 hours on the lectures. The projects themselves consume as much time as you want/have to put into, with at least 3-4 hours on average, but if you want to really learn and improve your skill, it requires a lot more than that."
1776,Great Course to understand the graph algorithms and one the skill to solve the Graph Problems.
1777,"very friendly, task isn't tough, learn much."
1778,"He need more quires, want to make projects and to check them"
1779,very useful
1780,"Really great course. I am currently working on the Jazz Guitar Professional Certificate program at Berklee online, and I will definitely take this class for a more detailed dive-in. Mary opened my mind on the keys skill to improvised, his chord-scale method explanation, and demonstration is simple to understand and provides a great way to continue practicing and developing the skill thought."
1781,"Excellent, clear to-the-point explanations supported by watching graphics and pace. About the best course I've taken so far."
1782,"The class would have been better if the financing option/strategics had been further categories according to different stages of development of the started. I liked most of the content. Nevertheless, speaking of issues like IPO and several stages of funding did not seem relevant to a great majority of status, at least for early stage ones. (Is figures demonstrated in the class, many failed and the mostly adopted early stage funding option is from family & friends).Anyway, it really was a great class, intense, interesting and important in entrepreneurship! Thank you!"
1783,English for Media Literacy is very useful and great. I will apply Media Literacy on my work and life daily.His is a wonderful course ! Thank you very much.
1784,loves the class and the online lectures!
1785,this is very useful thank you!!!!
1786,One of the best instructor. Takes the course so interesting that you can't wait to see what's coming next. I completed the 4 week course in three days( minus the assignment).
1787,very good course for beginners
1788,"I would add more examples on how to populace the data, even spend time on optional video where the professor or his assistant goes through testing ratio (something similar to Operations Analytics). I feel like the professor was rushing through his explanations and the models. Maybe people found the course very useful however I felt like there was too much text and immediate switch to Expel file that was elaborated shortly. Overall, I am not sure how to apply these ratio in my final project..."
1789,"I've taken several statistics, data science, and R courses. His is one of the best."
1790,"Good tools and explanations, good audit. Thanks!"
1791,"I learned so much from this course. In particular, I've got a much more solid grasp of SQL (even though I've been using it for 30 years), and much more clarity about ""map/reduce"". The lectures are clear, delivery is excellent, and the assignment are interesting."
1792,"I love this course and I appreciate all the gifts our universe, our earth give me. I will cherish the earth and keep doing my best to protect what I have, what we have."
1793,It was a very detailed course and the senators absolutely exceptional. The extra exercises really helped achieve a better understanding of how to use the tools. Thank you!

1795,Amazing! I feel like the course material was much easier to follow than other classes.
1796,Great course!
1797,"great course!, thanks :)"
1798,His is a good course. The course brings to your consciousness the ways in which the brain can function and the course provides some helpful approaches to learning new subjects.
1799,"I don't feel this course is always very clear. I Feel that I usually am missing the big picture. I follow it in details, but the pace does not match in terms of how you can view the big picture of it."
1800,"I found the into that was taught in this course to be interesting and highly relevant to a wide range of situations in my life (work, school, personal). I highly recommend!"

1803,The course was extremely good and easy to understand!!
1804,Its the best course that i have ever take in my life.
1805,"Good course for new earners. Twitching back and forth between Time Value of Money and the Decisions framework can be off-putting, though. Organisation of material is not necessarily the best, but the course is definitely worth taking for Finance derbies."
1806,Course was great. I learnt so many things in less time. Thank you professor Muppala
1807,"Good and very useful tips kept simple and easy to understand for everybody. However, personally I was looking for a more advanced content."
1808,All basis of typography. More advanced topics are next.
1809,"Quite good in average. Will be better to have always or very often the sides in background. New presented were not much interesting. Good examples given, but sometimes I do not see how proposition can be used on daily basis"
1810,Great course
1811,Thanks
1812,Great course!
1813,His course has changed my mind
1814,"I think the professor is clear an concise (I know, the word ""clear"" is not easy to define). The content is very interesting, and definitely relevant. It might be so that I won't use EVERYTHING I learned here in my daily life, but I definitely have tools to provide better arguments, and debate other people's arguments.Some parts of the course are heavy, but with a little bit of effort and education, one can follow."
1815,great and information course :) really enjoyed it
1816,His is by far one of the best courses I have taken. It's intriguing and thought-provoking while providing fascinating information and going into detail on how forensic science works.
1817,"I've learned about some paintings and object, but the format of the course was weak. Should have stuck with the historical progression of Modern Art--tried and true approach."
1818,Accounting made easy and exciting!! Strongly recommended =)
1819,His course is to much about graphlab and not enough about the mechanics of machine learning.
1820,"Great Into, great course."
1821,"The best course that I have taken before, I love the material smooth and clear, easy to keep in mind and understand! highly recommended"
1822,"His was a good introduction that bought in some new and previously visited concepts. I did find the course a little 'witty' compared to other courses I have completed through Coursera, and the assignment were not very clearly structures.That said I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid introduction to this area."
1823,A very good course that introduced a lot a financial concepts. Not too deeply but widely.
1824,"A thorough introduction into using CSS3, the lectures are well explained and someone who has never used CSS before will definitely gain confidence in using style sheets."
1825,i like this course. The syllabus coverage is good. i am eagerly waiting to knoll the next course...
1826,Excellent course. Provides an overview of the best learning strategics based on a synthesis of research and anecdotes. Highly recommended.
1827,it was great learning such interesting issues
1828,"great foundation course, gets you working on a knowledge portfolio!"
1829,Great course.
1830,"The course was really good. They give you idea what's proper way to use business language. However, it's hard to get professional feedback from the peer-grade assignment."
1831,A good course for beginners in patron
1832,The best in the field
1833,interesting course

1837,"That's a great course. I'm from Brazil and really loving it, understanding what's being said without any problem."
1838,"First things first, I am really glad that I 'stumbled' over this course. I got to know a lot about what to eat and how calorie are not everything we ought to be looking for. After this course, I have come to know that I've been reading the nutrition labels wrongly all my life."
1839,"His course is outstanding. It not only de-mysteries sinfulness, but increased my own sinfulness, even though I have benefited immensely from a Vipassana course several months ago. Or. Soto-Bones has navigated the controversial subject of sinfulness brilliantly by his own articulate manner of objectivity, while tickling topics such as religion, philosophy, and commercialization head on, without superimposing his own views, leaving the ultimate choice of what concepts and beliefs one wants to retain, modify, or discard entirely to the student. To that end, his highly qualified, I even say, wise guests contributed significantly through their own views and/or exercise guidance. I hope many more will benefit from this course in future. By best wishes to Or. Soto-Bones and a heartfelt thank you to hi and all his guests!"
1840,The course Machine Learning is very good.
1841,I greatly enjoyed the course. Galere is very intriguing person. I enjoyed listening to her and doing all the exercises. I was nervous about the self portrait at first. In the end it was a wonderful exercise to look into yourself. I also enjoyed the conversation as I met a lovely lady called Ruth. Thank you to HEC and savior-relief team!
1842,His is excellent. Thanks to course!
1843,His course was an excellent beginning to REALLY learning how to build a webster. I would absolutely highly recommend Pollen van Went as an instructor!

1845,"By far, one of the best basis courses out there."
1846,so goods perfectly Helpfultnx a lot
1847,His course clears all my mental blocks regarding the process of learning. Of you think that this is not a professional level course I would say this course will make learning as your profession.
1848,Thank you son much!!!!I really like the course.It help me in my job =)
1849,His course is information and comprehensive.

1854,The best online course I have ever taken.
1855,Awesome course!
1856,"His was an excellent course, in terms of both the content and structure. The way the lessons and course material were presented was both interesting and manageable.

Thank you so much."
1857,Thanks for opening the University knowledge to the world.
1858,It will be nice to add some more extra exercises with a complete guide in the wiki section.

1862,Excellent!!! I am gain much knowledge from this course
1863,It is one of the most structures course that I have ever seen In line and is very simple to understand.
1864,His was a great course. Very useful and simple to follow for a non-native speaker. I am definitely going to use some of the technique I learned on this course. Thank you!
1865,Homework are super fun and challenging!The lectures are super clear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1866,His is one of the best course online - its a pre-course to all the MOOC learning we are going to do in future. Everyone who is thinking of learning and developing skill online as a part of their lives then they should start from this course. Both instructor are pretty cool and everything is explained in best possible way. 5 stars course.
1867,I can make sense very exactly because professor explain the focus of Software Security very well.It's good for me to understand that what is the Software Security.
1868,His is an excellent course¡¡
1869,His course is enjoyable and easy to learn from. A minor drawback is that some pictures are difficult to distinguish in the exercises.
1870,"I have done a few courses on entrepreneurship and venture capital, so I was quite curious to see what this course had to offer, taking the opposite approach.And I must say, that it has been the most valuable learning experience so far for me on Coursera. It's really good and it gave me confidence that I'm on the right track, because I will much rather work with my customers than investors, and then bootstrap until I have to money to grow."
1871,His course was very helpful in my professional and everyday life. Any thanks for the information and dose of humor :)
1872,Great course ... learned a lot!
1873,Great into to how to teach and what it makes it to learn. I started using what I have been learning here right away in my ESL teaching practice. Great job. I highly recommend the course.
1874,The title created too many expectations
1875,Course is pretty good and the pace it goes through is quite good. Chuck does a great job to keep it going :).
1876,good course
1877,Very well done for a true beginner.
1878,"Really interesting, good questions,great topic."
1879,very good course. I add this comment when I review this course :)
1880,Great course! I learned a lot and am looking forward to the other coursesthank you very much
1881,Good course
1882,"I'm not saying R Programming has to be a gripping subject, but this course is pretty dull. The value of good teaching methods is often underrated in transferring knowledge."
1883,Fantastic introduction to programming and Python.
1884,Very Excellent Course
1885,"The title says it all. Great overview of the history, technology, and security of internet. From the title and the nature of these lecture type courses I was worried it would be boring, but not with Or. Chuck :) He brings all of the concepts down to earth and help us understand them thoroughly at the same time. Highly recommended for everyone, especially non of major jumping into programming!"
1886,"Very nice course, it varies a lot with the content so many different angles are mentioned."
1887,"Great beginners course, well balanced level of technical details with respect to fact that no previous knowledge is needed."
1888,"His is a great course. I was new to Scala but had previous programming experience with functional programming but I could learn a lot. The lectures are very interesting, the examples are great and the assignment' level of difficulty are at an appropriate level."
1889,"Very information, different format of teaching, loved how thorough the complimentary resources were."
1890,Awesome course
1891,It's interesting to learn Python .
1892,"His course could have been better in my opinion, if we could have exercise that would deal with the concepts in more detail. I felt myself involved deeply in understanding the problem statement, rather than practicing the concepts explained in the course."
1893,"One of the best course, for every one who want to learn more in his field."
1894,"Awesome course that definitely required some education indeed. The quires were fun because they were challenging ... there should have been a way to randomize the questions better because the questions were awesome but repeated in different tries to improve my scores ... and so, it became easier to correct your mistakes (that's a positive actually)."
1895,Have me a great general knowledge of front end development. Of course there could have been a lot more information but it was just enough to get me interested in learning more on my own
1896,"In modern people's wisdom, wisdom of the ancients, a critical perspective in the discard the dress and select the essential understanding of the history, divergence thinking, to seize the core,excellent!"
1897,"Lots of good information. However, this course could be structures a lit bit better. More examples and small practice exercises within the lectures would significantly improve the retention of material.You should losses at least basic knowledge of statistics."
1898,"I can only infer that this course's target audience is rich pregnant women who care about shoe shopping and cerebritis. Unfortunately I am none of those things and had to cringe my way through the examples, watching the video at x speed.The course itself is incredibly shallow, even for a survey course, and basically serves as an ad for one of the professors' own products -- Graphlab Create. You'll be much better off taking Andrew G's course, which is significantly more in depth and forces you to write your own solutions to problems instead of relying on a proprietary library.The only reason to prefer this course is if you really dislike the idea of using matas."
1899,"I was expecting something else, very basic information."
1900,"Clear, well-paced and engaging classes. I appreciated the overview of key debates in each topic, and my experience with this course was made all the more enjoyable through the passion with which the lectures spoke about their respective areas of interest."
1901,"Wonderful course. I highly recommend it. All the professors and people invited to share experiences are very well prepared, they speak in a way that it easy to understand. I learned a lot and realized that as a general doctor from another country still need so much to learn about just the basis of this epidemic. I loved it."
1902,I think the process of the class is a bit too fast and it is hard for beginners to catch up
1903,"Very clear, basic and organized course. It could be better to taught in python3 :)"
1904,The course lessons could have been more specific and provide more explanations on many topics that are later required in the assignment
1905,i love this course and the professor!!
1906,"His course is some!Any thanks to professor G for explaining it so easy. I feel this course has been written from the perspective of the student.Hans also for Tom Other and the other consultant for the tutorials and explaining the exercises well, without telling the solutions."
1907,"The Capstone helped me to incorporate all the technique absorbed in the previous three courses into my teaching technique. Doubtless, there are hundreds of aspects and peculiarities to master, but I did enhance my overall teaching mastery, having completed the Capstone.Verdict: Highly Recommended:)West regards,Rafael DauletESL Teacher"
1908,"its was a wonderful experience , scope of the course is very well planned"
1909,Amazing course. Learning a lot here. Thanks

1916,Great introduction course to learn rapid web application development on Ruby on Nails.
1917,"Some course , thank you !!"
1918,"Great course on the fundamental principles around of. A good combination of theory and practice, including challenging exercises. I would recommend making an update to reflect recent developments and perhaps adding a subtrack of more practical / close to 'real life' exercise"
1919,His module is quite information but easy to understand. I believe Prof has put a lot of efforts into the designing of this course.
1920,"amazing vital course for all parents, professional and anyone who wants to make the world more inclusive , thank"
1921,His course should be made mandatory for every kiss in school.
1922,Precise and compact course study starting from basis of Cava to the passing of data from files.Even a beginner can understand the way it has been taught in the course.
1923,It's very good!
1924,excellent course. I am fully satisfied.
1925,Great introduction to using technique in previous course with online data.
1926,"Great class with a great teacher, but lack of a forum to discuss ideas and problems severely limits it."
1927,The best course on course
1928,"excellent! educational, entertaining and enjoyable"
1929,Amazing lectures!
1930,Offers immense knowledge about the macroeconomics and its impact on the real world.
1931,It's a lesson with quantity.And it's not hard to understand.The man teacher's speed is low so I use 1.5 times of original speed. Thanks to faculty contributed to this course.
1932,Great!
1933,"It is an excellent course, perfect to enter the wonderful world of programming for IOS applications."
1934,it could be easily compressed in a two-weeks course.Sometimes interviews are too long for what they need to explain.
1935,His is a great course to provide someone with the basic foundation in Expel.
1936,not easy but valuable course
1937,Great course!
1938,"I'm quite sure you need a quite strong background in baths to be able to really understand this course, it should have more path lessons, or reading about it."
1939,"The course is just amazing, the assignment on the other hand are much less: hard, grade issues ...Thank you!"
1940,It was awesome. Perfect for beginners like me. Thanks Or. Chuck! You are one amazing teacher!
1941,"Great course, great instructor, the presentation of the material is outstanding"
1942,"I have learned a lot in this course. It is very nice, but I think that it would be nice if the students can communicate with the teacher directly, because sometimes there are some comments or questions and it is only read it by the group."
1943,"Its been a great course, many into and points that are fantastic in the learning or adding new knowledge always. I will always recommend this course for those who want to know more and learn design."
1944,I of LEARNING A LOT AND of PRONUNCIATION SKILLS HAS IMPROVED.
1945,very interesting course
1946,"Excellent course, challenging and great fun"
1947,Some of the video feel a little outdated but otherwise high quality.
1948,"The course is really great and is surely going to help me a lot.Thanks to Or.Chuck,his way of teaching is quite interesting and very easy and comfortable to understand and grasp quickly."
1949,"Very easy to understand, and excellent filling. Great job on this one!"
1950,"Door, very poor course, worse course structure. Instructor hasn't put any thoughts in how they should structure this course.Over no basis, assumes lots of thing and term this course as beginner for Cava where actually there is no Cava taught."
1951,Very useful and insightful
1952,"it is very helpful for learning something new.Thanks, good teacher."
1953,Great course! I STRONGLY suggest that everyone should take this course.
1954,It basic for me
1955,A great class for easing into the world of Python.
1956,"Easy to understand.... Must perfect for people who are new to programming. Well, to be able to finish the assignment.... you would need a little understanding of Baths. During this course, you will learn the basic understanding of programming, how computer works, and as well how to program in Atlas & some Atlas term( Basic Calculation, Varices, Doctors, Ocular, Functions, Built-in Function, Election, Loop, Data Type, Mile Input/Output ). After completing the course, you should be equipped with basic solid understanding of programming in Atlas. His may help you to build complex algorithm in the near future."
1957,"It is an excellent course. Anyone who is new or old to the current job market must consider taking it. I will highly recommend since I learned new strategy and insight into how to write Resumes, Over Letter and Follow-Up letter and most importantly what I shouldn't do to jeopardized my chances of success. I may visit other areas as time permits.. Thank You."
1958,"His course provides a good overview about virtual instruction and online learning for those who are looking to transition from classroom teaching. The topics are broken down into manageable chinks and a few interviews with other people help to add interest. However, when I wanted to go back and reread for clarification, I found the transcribe to be poorly edited and at times almost unintelligible. Is an example: iNACOL (National Association for Online and Blended Learning) is referred to many times in the video lectures and was transcribe in the text in a number of different ways: ""An Sickle"", ""Naples"" and ""nickel."" I really wish the people who put this course together has taken the time to read and edit the transcripts of the video lectures. Any sentences were written without punctuation or contained misspelled words. (enrollment was spelled enrollment) Often I just wanted to read it the lecture, not hear the instructor's voice but found the written text to be less than clear. I also wish there had been a way to ask questions regarding the material, but unfortunately, there was not, not that I could find. Finally, some of the questions on the final quit are confusing. For example, question #5 "" Which two of the following..."" and then in parentheses it says to check all that apply. I hope this feedback helps to point out some of the problems that hinder virtual instruction."
1959,Please issue me a certificate. I am ready to pay the fees. Thanks:Devashree Shah
1960,"Excellent course! I am a total novice in the topic, but Or. Fredrickson is a MASTER on sharing her wide knowledge and expertise on Positive Psychology. I would recommend it for sure."
1961,"Awesome, great instructor, pretty clear."
1962,Same to know and judge various topics and common laws including specific once.Great teaching spirit and good explanations.
1963,I think it was a great MOOC.
1964,"Great course of thermodynamic. I learn a lot about energy generation, mechanical equipment and fluids properties"
1965,Interesting course that I thoroughly enjoyed. Would recommend.
1966,Great content and moves. Would have been even better if the professor spoke a little more loudly and perhaps there were guest experts.
1967,His course helps a lot. Takes it easy and clear to write different types of essay.
1968,"It was interesting to learn on how to better manage my time, although was too theoretical."
1969,"Fantastic course, cannot recommend it highly enough!"
1970,"I would like a different approach on the way this course is given to the student. The first couple of classes were really cool and inspiring, but the later two became more of the same and kind took my inspiration and motivation down to finish the course."
1971,"Good course, material needs more coverage in programming assignment. For example months and future were not covered."
1972,Incredible professor and great course. I give Professor G 10 starts out of 5!
1973,the course is perfect
1974,LOVE of!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1975,Great professor! :)
1976,"Interesting course, even though it covers only topics relating to investment management within a portfolio and path formula could be better explained using more concrete examples.But for anyone who has not a finance degree and wants to acquire knowledge in this field, it's definitely worth it!"
1977,Professor Door is very friendly and clear in his lectures. He also answers questions in the discussion found with speed and detail. I was able to learn a lot from this course and challenged myself to a heavier load of lectures than I had expected because they were not boring at all. By only cadet is that the questions in his quires can sometimes be unnecessarily confusing because of wording or tricks.
1978,"The lectures, assignment, and projects all encourage you to learn about how to design and use optical search algorithms for text-based applications. I especially value how the discussions present the material in way that is relatively easy to see how it relates to search routine in general. By only complaint is that the instructions do not inform you about the constraint that the online grade implicitly imposes on you. His unfortunately meant that I was not able to submit code with further optimizations that I came up with."
1979,"$38 is a lot to pay for tutorials about how to install software. His course takes only 20 minutes to complete. It is also obsessed with command line interface. There's a reason that they were left behind in the was. It does cover GUI software like Studio, which is ignored for the rest of the course. Now about something on the desktop Github version? http://desktop.github.com/ To much easier to use."
1980,Excellent course.. very practical and didactic
1981,Very interesting course. Pleasant and well explained. The mathematics related are complicated to follow sometimes but it can be done. The assignment also can be completed following the lectures and the handouts.
1982,currently at week 2 - learning bootstrap is a great fun.
1983,"Great Course, but much too fast paced"
1984,"Good information and assignment design, but please just have someone on your team go through this. I could list the issues with your lectures, but they're so easy to detect by anyone who is watching them actively. It makes me think that of isn't a part of your workflow, and worry about the quality of future courses in this specialization."
1985,One of the best law courses in Coursera!
1986,A good start for learning game design and development
1987,the course is an eye opened and highly inspiring.
1988,Vice course for just beginner web developer
1989,Excellent material and pedagogy. Highly recommended to all types of people from all background.

1991,"A very engaging, enriching and traumatic course on happiness and positive psychology."
1992,great introduction
1993,"nice to start, nice explaining"
1994,"I know a lot of work went into preparing this material. Although the Table of Contents serves this purpose in a more text-rich, usually complicated way - something I would find very useful is a step by step table or guide (to ensure no step is skipped) for the entire process, i.e.Requirement ActivitiesUse CasesWireframesStory Board developmentUser Story DevelopmentProduct Backlog Developmentand so on. I hope this will be helpful."
1995,"It's an open-finding experience! A lot of studies, researches, examples - a lot of fun too! I recommend it everyone - unhappy and happy and everyone in between as I was happy before the course but now I know WHY. ;p"
1996,Amazing! Mary Button open a new world developing skill with direct and easy speech. Recommended.
1997,I love both of my professors and learning a lot of new things about photography
1998,"His is one of the best project I have done in my life. His project gives you insight into how to build secure applications. It has three different rounds including a built-it round, break-it round and fix-it round and each of them were equally challenging and fun.I would recommend everyone to take this capstone project and you won't regret your investment ever."
1999,we need more teachers like Or. Severance
2000,Very effective
2001,The explanation with examples is pretty clear to understand.Course contents are perfect.
2002,His course is awesome. Great to learn a bit more about the history of the tool we use most nowadays.
2003,"I learned a lot from the course.The instructions of the last exercise could be less detailed, so as it would be more challenging"
2004,Great course
2005,It is better to merge the content of all 3 courses in one... very less content
2006,Great presentations. awesome instructor. nice overview and introduction of SPM.
2007,"Very information course, a must for all Artists."
2008,West ever on Coursera! Thank you so much!!
2009,"Excellent MOOC. Gives the fundamentals to understand what a serious game is, how it relates to games and how it can become persuasion. You learn key principles needed before you want to start creating. Interesting week assignment."
2010,His is a great curse. A must for every student who really wants to learn any subject in a productive manner!
2011,"Simple, elegant and very useful ..."
2012,Vice course for starting web pp development career
2013,"I really enjoyed learning this course! All the course material, including the sides, quires, programming problem descriptions, are so well prepared. I like those subtle animation used in those examples in the teaching sides. They just simply help!"
2014,"Wonderful course and equally wonderful instructor. I really like how Scott build up from a very simple model and by explaining the intuition behind how we got the path, explains the baths."
2015,"His course taught by Prof. Robert Miller is incredibly insightful and interesting - the passion of the professor is obvious The content was relevant and well edited, which in turn generate a fantastic introduction to the world of finance."
2016,"Too fast speech/ language use in combination with poor english translation, otherwise pretty well done."
2017,Exceeded my Expectations!
2018,Great House really enjoyed and dear
2019,More matter should be covered in this course.
2020,"I'e been using Scala at work for more than a year, but still M Odersky and E Leiter brought me a lot in this course"
2021,"The course was information and some of the material regarding database will be useful towards my current job. However, I felt that in classes 3 and 4, Python was really an after thought. I believe I could have completed this course without ever taking the first two classes because the assignment only required slight modifications to existing code. I was more analyzing patterns rather then truly understanding the code. I would rather see the course continue to expand upon basic programming knowledge so that I can write the code by myself instead of seeking examples to cut/paste all the time."
2022,A great introduction to nutrition and cooking for families. -Pediatrician
2023,Good enough to be an into.
2024,amazing and easy to learn and really really great teacher
2025,His course helps me a lot

2058,Great course for non-programme to get started.
2059,basic but interesting
2060,Great course! I enjoyed understanding how Machine Learning works. Andrew G is a great teacher.
2061,"-------- this course should be used as a model for all the other courses. this course tells you what they're going to tell you and then they tell you; then they tell you what they told you. then, of course, they repeat what they told you a little bit later and then a while later, and yet again much later . i'm teasing, slightly. but this course does what they say they're going to do !they tell you and give you a chance to practice what they told you. then they give you another chance to practice a little while later, and yet again, much later, etc . . .the subtitles match the speech. the subtitles are correctly spelled. the speech is correctly pronounced. they mix and match the points they're making, interlacing as they go.this is the way all courses should be . . ."
2062,Great Course !!!
2063,It´s ideal for beginners. The teacher explain every thing very clear.
2064,very cool topics
2065,"articulation needs to be improved, talked too fast, content doesn't give much"
2066,These lectures help me learn the basic knowledge about machine learning!
2067,"The Course was really encouraging and a great fun. Any thanks to the creator of the course - Or. Have Dixon, Or. Austin Shewell and Jessica Into. Your efforts were not vain. You are great educators!!!"
2068,Provides good tips for how to in
2069,Very good course!
2070,"I was a little lost during projects, there no extensive video for languages but on the other hand there was good materials and referred links that could help."
2071,"Interesting course that clearly describes design thinking. Some of the lectures are really excellent, although some did not meet my expectations. By only other problem was that at times I felt more like I was watching an avert for the course creator's book rather than learning about Design Thinking."
2072,His course helps any beginner to understand the fundamentals of what it takes to create graphics design. Great course!
2073,"this course brings to me a explanatory answers to the ordinary physical works surrounding us, i can say that is a fundamental stuff for beginner who love physics. It's naturally good."
2074,I have learned more here!Thank you very much Coursera!
2075,Fantastic course! Too bad there's no part 3...
2076,"I believe this course is critical and much needed given where the Industry is heading. Prof Week, has tried his best to explain the concepts in a lucid manner, however the complexity of the content, may challenge most students.A few more examples with R code would have been helpful as translating problem statement to R code may not be intuition.I would highly recommend that students should plan to study some advance statistics before attempting this course. Having said that, i think this is a wonderful started course to get a glimpse of what Machine Learning is all about."
2077,Very interesting. Ethernet interface isnnice
2078,A good course that gives a detailed insight about GIS.
2079,It good know some known logic to work with CSS3.
2080,Pretty well
2081,With pleasure.
2082,A great way to learn more
2083,It provides not only a good overview about Of Printing but stimulated people who attend it to look for more. Great course to start the journey
2084,Good started course.
2085,Run course that explored why dogs are so special. I especially it when Or. Are explained the different experiments and their results.
2086,"Wrong subtitles, no communication..."
2087,More Exciting course
2088,very poor organized.
2089,"Full of tools based on hands-on experience from some very smart people - fun, challenging with so much wisdom collected in one place. Wouldn't have spend my precious time in a more rewarding way, thank you"
2090,it's really helpful course thank u so much. Susan
2091,"Very good course, I've much pleasure"

2094,The course features great video with experts on diplomacy. I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about this field of study.
2095,His course is really AMAZING...I really recommend to take this course. The teacher is very clear and outstanding in explaining concepts. The practical exercises are very instructive.
2096,Great course! Really helped me to achieve a better understanding of the music theory and how the basis of composition Works.
2097,"Takes a bit of time to get into the france of Python if familiar with coming, but ultimately as advertised."
2098,"Extremely badly organized, mess, and technical"
2099,His course has done exactly what it advertised. Anyone with or without a programming background can learn MATLAB easily. The video lectures and course material are very very helpful. All the assignment are designed o enhance your learning. Excellent course!!!
2100,Great starting point to understanding how of works.
2101,Pretty Solid!
2102,"It's a course of very good quality, but personally I wanted something more challenging. I believe that since there are advanced version of texts, there should also be advanced version of tests in order to make people like me work harder. I would also like to see more peer-reviewed assignment, these are very good."
2103,"Good. But presentation is not satisfactory.However, thanks a lot for this course :)"
2104,"Great course, learnt a lot and got some good ideas to improve my technique"
2105,"I love the pace of the course. Professor Think not only teach me how to write in patron ,but also how to think like computer. It makes me learn the patron more deeply."
2106,"His course is very helpful tool because give you several tips for your learning process, you can learn more with the additional interviews that show you personal experiences and may improve your habits of study."
2107,Somewhere during the second week there is a gap in coming that I could not overcome and this ruined the whole interest in pursuing the course because in order to overcome it I had to cheat. I don't feel like I am learning anymore.
2108,Learned something new in this course. I appreciate that.
2109,Very Impressed!
2110,"Presented is reading the sides. I feel I would have been able to learn as much by just reading the sides.CDN course is a bit more visual, with some maps and charts used during the course"
2111,I love this class
2112,A great place to start a foundation of a solid new business.
2113,"just awesome. maximizes discovery of concepts. each video is an ah moment. highly recommend to anyone who'd like a deeper understanding of programming. if it does not come through that i'm raving about this course, i am raving."
2114,"10+ weeks of fun projects, what else do you need???Awesome! Highly recommend for people who want to build their own game fast!"
2115,Very practical course! A bit light on theoretical explanation. Of you're looking for theoretical course this might not be the best but it still serves as a great traumatic or into to theory.
2116,I learned a lot about telephone that I had not been exposed to in the past. It's a shame my father wasn't still around as he was a data technical for of&T back in the day. He could have had some interesting conversations.
2117,Great Course! Helped a lot for the future and gave some complete new insight.
2118,"Father basic, nevertheless a good introduction to the topic of machine learning with R. Mostly concentrated on applications of the R caret package."
2119,"While providing some knowledge about drugs and drug-addition, I would have preferred a more in-depth guide into the inner workings of the brain related to drugs. Nevertheless it served as a good introduction to addition."
2120,Very systematic and full of main knowledge course!
2121,"Very interesting course. The short video's are very well put together, complement the texts and become slightly more difficult overcome which allows to 'grow' into the course. I studied Latin and Greek during high school with a large focus on the translations rather than the underlying philosophy. Still, that helps me quite a bit in understanding (recollection ;-) ) the translations."
2122,"Course is great, specially the assignment. On't depend on lecture video too much, this is a programming course so you'll have to get your hands dirty. On't forget to work on will() package, its a great way to learn interactive."
2123,"Gros:ContentProfessorDepth of materialCons:Adams are shit, full of mistakes, stupid questions asking 2 values but you have one field to fill in the data. Totally unacceptable quality issues with exam. READ THE FORUM!!!!"
2124,I Love Astrophysics And sir Please Add More Courses .
2125,Very interesting course
2126,Very clear and easy to understand.
2127,"Python for everyone is One of the West Course on MOOC platform .Or. Chuck made it interesting and Knowledgeable. May back 3 Months ,I can't even thing of the stuff that I leaned and implements ."
2128,Very good online decision-making and scenario course!
2129,Very interesting! I am glad I can now follow par of
2130,"Beer review assessment in this kind of course, with more complexity, are a little bit annoying. Someone reviewed my essay (1 introduction + 3 body paragraphs + conclusion) saying stuff about my ""5 body paragraphs"", showing that she has not even understood what a body paragraph was. His same girl also noticed ""lots of punctuation mistakes"" in my essay, while others evacuated it as ""almost perfect"". I know it is kind of complicated to teachers and senators review the essays, but this model is a bit frustration. :/ Other than that, the course was just amazing! I loved the video, the format, the quires and games really helped me to learn, and the proposed essays were nice. Thanks!!"
2131,"I learned a lot and interact with the community.I recommend everyone who are interested in Social Media or Marketing to do this course. Now I have another eyes to use social media.Thank you, Coursera! :)))"
2132,was too slow for me to follow
2133,"His is an excellent introductory course to computer programming. It gives you all the opportunities to learn at your own pace.It is not too difficult to clear the capstone itself, but the course gives you the opportunity to chose your own project which makes it all the more interesting."
2134,Fantastic Course for people who want to know the details to do great analysis and reports
2135,Very good course .... patron has the language of future
2136,it helps me a lot
2137,"I took this amazing course and found myself crying through the first 3 video. I never knew what the child and parents experience. By state is planning to pass a ""bathroom bill' and I now know the full horrors of that. Being transgender is not a religious issue or a female privacy issue, but rather reaching out to children who need acceptance, support, and understanding. A wonderful course taught in a beautiful manner. A must for all teachers, parents, and healthcare provides! Thank you!"
2138,Highly recommended!
2139,Very information and interactive.
2140,Amazing teaching.
2141,Great Course.
2142,"very well organized, good teacher, good projects. PCA and SVD are pretty hard to understand for who is not in the field (statistics), but no evaluation on this topic."
2143,"the course is designed in a way you can not accomplished or get certificate on the proposed timeframe. It was very disappointing to pay for mortification and not be able to get it due to issues with the course developer ( a lack of understanding of how course works, it's clear they did not care to adapt to a 5 week course) and peer reviewed activities proposed that took over 6 weeks to get done. (further to the course timeframe) The assistance from developer was too poor and never sought to find solutions, which is very strange in a course for reaching. Not the mention video quality that is scar, I could not watch the video, and preferred to study by reading the transcription."
2144,Exploration of the darkness shadow ever cast in human history by implacable scholars on the subject. Now we need to extrapolate this information widely so that the human psychic is exposed in our modern world and the ghost of all these dehumanized victims will forever triumph over their oppressors.
2145,I enjoyed the course. It covered many machine learning topics and supplied good advice and simple working example. It is a great practical guide.
2146,Generally quite good in reviewing a multitude of aspects. I did miss not having my responses evacuated even though I decided just to audit this course. In almost all occasions others courses let you evaluate your learning as you go so this was disappointing.I did purchase Gloom's book which I find easy to read and very complimentary to the course.
2147,A very educational and enlightening course. Was spared my interest to work in the Oil & Was industry.
2148,Low paced.
2149,"I was hoping the lectures would be more dense. By previous course courses where on data science, machine learning, etc. I somewhat feel that the content on those courses is twice or thrice more."
2150,nothing in common with reality. nothing that can prepare for real interviewuseless loss of time
2151,I had a good time and learned on how to use array and hasmaps for storing and searching data.
2152,"The actual material in the course is fascinating and quite useful but, as is common with so many Coursera courses, the enjoyment of completing the course is severely hampered by the requirement to review the final assignment of other students. The purposes of these courses is to learn from experts in the field not to grade the work of others. I wish Coursera would really stop professors from pushing their responsibility- trading the work of the students and offering THEIR feedback- onto the students who may or may not have a firm grasp of the material in question."
2153,Thanks for professor's good lectures in this course. I really enjoy this course. And this course help me get much confidence in learning programming.
2154,"what a golden opportunity given by' almighty' course to train teachers to rather become professional teachers !!!.....now course, you are perfectly the best ."
2155,"The lectures and interviews are relatively short and the quires don't ask that much of you, nevertheless this is a fantastic introduction to the south and explored a good breath of the arts and culture. The depth and passion of William Morris's knowledge is obvious. He left me wanting more so I bought two of his multimedia books on Amazon, although he modestly didn't plug them I had to hunt them down.http://www.amazon.co.up/William-Morris/e/B001H6IZGW/red=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2?did=1452359183&s=8-2"
2156,The instructor are such good examples of kindness. I like the gentle and effective course. I plan to take it again!
2157,"Sorry to say that this is not a well prepared course. The course video provided is quite short, the quit is rather than nothing and the programming assignment are buggy. I don't feel that I learned a lot from this course.penn has let me down twice. Hope the rd one will be better."
2158,I want to say I like our teacher very much. Thank you so much.
2159,"very well put together. easy to fit into my schedule, short video make it easy to dive in and pace yourself."
2160,"Great course, recommended"
2161,"Excellent teaching of digital signal processing theory and technique. Even form an engineering student who already has most on the material, is a very good review source."
2162,A very interactive and learning course
2163,Not of examples and theory well explained. Course includes suggestions where to look for further knowledge.
2164,"Coursera changed the rules on access to grade quires in the middle of this specialization. The last course in the specialization allowed free access to grade quires and homework.During this course, the ""free access"" to quires and assignment is no longer an option.Even more annoying is the fact that I also receive email reminding me to ""complete the quit"", which would require me to upgrade to a paid enrollment to allow me to submit assignment to trading.Thanks for nothing, Coursera!"
2165,A well rounded description of what goes into managing software products and client requirements. A basic course that serves well as a stepping stone.
2166,"I am so happy to have taken this amazing course, it really helped me a lot. Thank you :)"
2167,A perfect ending!
2168,A very good course and discussion board is the greatest help where you got directions to which area you need to explore to find answers.
2169,"Easy to follow, great information. I learned quite a few things in this course."
2170,"Generally an outstanding course, however I was a bit concerned that the video lectures, programming assignment, and quires didn't exactly follow the book."
2171,"Easy to follow, and the Or Chuck is quite interesting. However, the pace is a little slow. Still a good course, though."
2172,His course is very well set for bigginers. Thanks to all the professors who put their hard work on this course.
2173,"wonderful lecturer, great course design, very interactive and interesting. Thank you so much!"
2174,The best course to start with machine learning.
2175,"His is excellent course, the only reason why I am rating 4 stars because it does not allow you take the quires"
2176,Great course! The assignment had been designed to help the student practice and learn what was taught on the presentations. I was able to keep up with the course and am very satisfied by what I have learned.Thank you!
2177,All the basis of each section in 10 min video!
2178,Learned a lot
2179,Thanks to Andrew G for preparing an enjoyable course. I could watch the lectures while commuting on the tube and learning a lot. I got the basic of Machine Learning and I think I will use his lectures as references for revising when I go through more complicated algorithms.
2180,"Easy, breezy, very well explained :) Or. Chuck rules!!"
2181,It was quite refreshing in terms of my school knowledge. Thanks Professor Navvaro!!
2182,Highly recommend for those that do not have much free time.
2183,too redundant
2184,Great course!! I recommend to learn it! Really interesting and useful!
2185,Very poor CSS content
2186,Great!!
2187,"I really enjoyed the course. The course more than achieved my expectations. The right amount of information, good tips and very clear to understand.Thanks a lot."
2188,"The instructor needs improvement on her presentation skill. The is just reading off the sides instead of providing more examples and scenario to help student comprehend the material. I have to retaken almost every quit under her courses. In previous courses, I passed quires in one try. Please improve material or get a better instructor."
2189,"Overall great class, however, I'd have enjoyed more quantitative exercises and problem sets."
2190,Business and difficult level are great for beginners and people with tight schedules
2191,I thought it was enjoyable but the quality of some video was not that great. But the topic and well researches topics were wonderful and made up for it
2192,Love it
2193,THANK YOU!
2194,"His is an incredible starting point.The main theme of the course is dealing with the intrinsic uncertainty engrained in all entrepreneurial ventures. Of you don't know how to reduce this uncertainty, you may never make it out of the developmental phases, much less procure capital investments.His course certainly doesn't cover everything but it opens the door to what you really need to focus on. Hearing the language and the terminology is incredibly beneficial."
2195,His is an excellent course to start with Python and Prof. Charles has build up an excellent course work.Listening to his lecture is like listening to a music and going deep into it exploring new pathway.His way of delivering the lecture is so simple yet so deep that even a person without any of background could get on par. Thanks again and looking forward for the next course.
2196,"very interesting and helpful,,,,,,,easy to learn,,,babies are so cut"
2197,I thought this course was well structures and provided a great introduction to classical music. Is someone who listens to classical music I am better able to appreciate the various texture and influences of many composer. Thank you so much for this course!
2198,His course really offers an accessible introduction
2199,"Excellent course for beginners, with a very well structures content and an awesome instructor."
2200,"With acceptable technique using in data mining, Andrew did give us some intuition in of. Although it need to further learning on some Bayesian rules and path, but it's really worth it."
2201,"Good course, but too much data for the nodules to fully grasp without a background."
2202,I highly recommend this course for those who want to brush up on the high-level basis of the quantitative research methods.
2203,Really helpful. Was helped me to study better and realise that I can focus.
2204,"Easy to follow, teach some basic skill and background informationThis course is helpful for beginners, not for major"
2205,"-Would highly recommend for anyone looking to quickly get a basis for evaluation statistics and logistics of medical literature. Notes sections after video are an excellent supplement to the video (which are not too long), and does a great job of hitting high points.-Of I could make 1 change I would expand the test section to explain more tests (logistic repression, etc.)"
2206,this course at the end was very helpful to as I didn't know a lot of sites that can help me with managing my time & also my social
2207,"Great course, really well designed and with some interesting real life case studies. Lectures are clear and information and the assignment help cement your understanding of the content"
2208,"Quality of the video and sound are bad; a few minutes after starting a lesson, sound goes off or picture holds and moves no more... His made me stop the course."
2209,Great course that makes the content self-paced. The book is accessible and the expectation of assignment is reasonable. I highly recommend.
2210,"Vice course, useful to know the most common tools used to do Bioinformatics"
2211,"Teachers are really responsive to questions that were mentioned in the forum, and they provided me with a good start in philosophy. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in philosophy but has no previous experience. His course will lead you to the a different world."
2212,"His course provided me a strong comprehensive understanding of the basis of water management and the issues associated with it, which was effectively demonstrated through case studies across the world."
2213,well constructed! I am so glad I took my time in the course :) Thanks
2214,"Introduces to R , and directs the student towards resources for more advanced in depth reading."
2215,"I learned useful thinks about the Data structures like lists, and trees."
2216,"The method of teaching gives you a better understanding of why certain things in finance exist. It goes back in history at times, provides you with statistical data and the speakers are very knowledgeable in their own field. Because of that, you become more aware of where finance was (how companies and regulatory bodies operated before) and where it might head to."
2217,"Thank you for a very thorough and very enjoyable presentation on the Measles' history and music. I especially enjoyed the SCU's and the in-depth analysis of song structure, why the songs were written, how they were recorded and produced and how they fit in with the business side of the He"
2218,"To far, I am really enjoying this class. I am so thankful for this free source. I have taken a few patron classes, the the beginning was a review, however the instructor makes the course beginning very enjoyable to watch. Thank you!"
2219,"very interesting course going an introduction to the use of Python to work with web dataMaybe too quick but in any case, it is a good introduction."
2220,Thanks for great course.
2221,Great course!
2222,His is a very bad course I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as it doesn't concern to any coming.
2223,"Really interesting course, I really enjoy the class with Or. Chuck because he makes easy explanation of different concepts in programming that makes the excersices easy to solve. I have learned about data structures, a topic that I barely had knowledge and I hope I can apply this new knowledge in my future master course or at my future work... Deep doing video Or. Chuck, greetings from Caracas, Venezuela!"
2224,presentation has to be better
2225,"Very nice introduction, I wish homework were more clear and the autograder was much more smarter."
2226,Great course. Learned a lot of useful strategics and algorithms that will certainly improve my future work. Thanks for providing such a wonderful course.
2227,"His is a very information course. There are so many books available on Typography but I think this is best way typography can be defined for the graphics designer. Is a person belonging to design and architecture fraternity, I would definitely recommend this course to every aspirin graphics designer and artist."
2228,Learning a lot. His course is very concise
2229,"Quantitative Methods is a great course to get started with the topic. Since there is a lot of information especially if you don't have previous knowledge about the topics, the course candles it with simple examples that occur. Of you are interested in more information there is bonus material provided on the end of each week which is very interesting."
2230,Very useful as basis to learn more! And the Professor is great!
2231,A great course with a great amount of research and just enough Theory for those not musical educated to gain a further insight into the Measles Music.
2232,Great opportunity to learn new skill
2233,"Good course, comprehensive covering key concepts involved in Web development. Although It does not touch server side development, but provides foundation to pursue advanced courses in web development and design. Thanks Coursera."
2234,Interesting course. The assignment were a little bit too redundant for my taste.
2235,"clear, fun, and practical !"
2236,NLP is a total different thing and should be a course by itself. I would prefer a a large scale machine learning capstone where we could make models and it would fit better to real life situation! Through all the courses I worked hard only to reach NLP capstone? this doesn't feel right! Please fix it!
2237,May too basic. Probably only suitable for absolute beginners.
2238,Thank you for allowing me to audit this course.
2239,I think it will be more helpful if you already have some knowledge on coming.
2240,His is an amazing course! Very well structures and clearly explained with a lot of concrete examples.I really enjoyed and learned a lot!
2241,"The course was altogether great! The most important part is that it build interest in Python. Looking forward towards more courses with Or. Chuck, and of course with Coursera."
2242,"Helps in understanding the basic concepts of programming with the help of more general beginner specific programming language patron. Gives a deeper insight about how the functionality of logical and mathematical statements interpretation by a machine and expands out thinking about various control structures. Increases ones interest in programming and developing self skill like self thinking, optimizing and testing of different working models in a programming language."
2243,a good start for beginners
2244,"His course covers some most advanced topics about quadrotor's modeling, control and mapping."
2245,"Andrew G is an amazing and very sympathetic teacher. He has a remarkable ability to clearly articulate many of the complex concepts in machine learning, making this a very accessible course for newcomers to the field.I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in machine learning."
2246,"Started this course, but had to stop initially because I started a the. But I couldn't stop thinking about it so resumed the other day. Moved it."
2247,"A great (and gentle) introduction or review of fundamental concepts in Python programming and basic computer science. The lectures are clear and the assignment are relevant/well-designed.His course series is second only to MITx 6.00.x over at ed, which is considerably more challenging, time-consuming, and somewhat better executed. The code grade for the MIT course test a wide array of cases to ensure that the student has minimal leeway in terms of shortcuts while one could easily fool the auto-grade in this course. The assignment also lack depth and challenge compared to the MIT assignment.Overall, the course is well organized and a great option for beginners."
2248,"Great introduction to linear repression. Vice, clean R tutorials via the laws. The lectures do become a little monotonous, but there there are linked reading in a nice, open-source textbook if reading suits you better than listening."
2249,Uric is a great teacher and does a very good job of creating a very personal atmosphere in a online experience.
2250,"It helps you build your essay-writing muscles gradually. Too much emphasis on plagiarism. Some flaws in the trading forms. The level of the participants is quite mixed, most feedback they give is useless (""good"")."
2251,Excellent review of aspects of reading and writing. The part of integrated grammar was also good.
2252,very basic
2253,"Very very very very cool! I'm learning Chinese with this course. It's really awesome, because I'm going to China in july!!!!!! To happy"
2254,a wonderful experience! thank you!!
2255,"It's a great course, and i got a lot of useful skill from it. Thanks the two beautiful teachers very much."
2256,I appreciate this course because has some examples practical and good explanations
2257,Very good course to start to program in patron.
2258,"A very enjoyable course: not as easy as the subject would let you think. It is a real preparation in the sense that you get an intensive crash course on basis of of philosophy/history/tends and what's to be expected from a manager.The instructor really made an effort to render the course into a MOOC format. Each course is well document, his speeches are clear and each sentence has been carefully selected. He summarize a lot and makes an extra effort to make us understand how each subject is connected to the other. I found him a great pedagog.Is for quires, you need to understand the subject and not just memories.Very entertaining. I sure will watch it again!"
2259,Like it! Good information to get in touch with the experiences in inaccessibility that are occurring outside my country. :)
2260,Excellent course of microeconomics...
2261,Great course to learn the fundamentals of static mechanical analysis. Or. Whitman is extremely clear in his lessons
2262,clear without any cap
2263,I enjoyed the course! It helped me organise information about methods in understanding complex systems. I would have definitely used some more detailed explanations about the model building process.Thank you very much for your kind interest and effort!
2264,I really enjoyed how hands on this class was! I was able to create some beginner Trophic Elements. Thanks for the class!
2265,"His course was an excellent introduction to Agile, particularly for a 'newby'. Having heard about Agile I've been interested in learning more and found this course to be exactly what I needed."
2266,I enjoyed very much this course.
2267,"Excellent course but allow ample time for the assignment as it is quite challenging, or at least it was for me. I am looking forward to doing the next module."
2268,Amazing course. I learned so much about the game world.
2269,"West course, highly recommended"
2270,"Very good and quite interesting! From now on, I am a programme!"
2271,"From the absolute beginner i was, this course leveled up my knowledge.I am recommend strongly."
2272,"The topics are really interesting and advanced! However, there's a lot of talk in chinese, due to questions/answers from teacher and students, and the quires are a bit too easy. I learned a lot though."
2273,"The class format -- only quires during most weeks, no programming work, then ending with a *huge* programming assignment -- is really poor pedagogical technique. Of you're going to teach programming, have programming assignment *every* *week*, instead of dropping a massive assignment at the very end of the course."
2274,"I had a very poor experience being grade by peers. Although the Capstone Project Assignment itself is EXCELLENT, the peer trading public is not. I was not fairly grade, and I am sure of this 100%."
2275,His is an exceptional course. His course has helped me a lot. A limestone for duties in social media marketing...
2276,"Excellent course, I particularly appreciate how concepts are introduced with examples to set the terrain for the consequent courses. Will definitely recommend."
2277,I just love this stuff
2278,super! best online course on Marketing right now!
2279,It is really an amazing course. I learned a lot! I will now be using the knowledge I gained here to do my thesis. Thank you Or. Human! Thank you penn. Thank you course for giving me the chance to have this course.

2283,Great insight and enjoyable.
2284,Excellent course to get your brain thinking. Opens your eyes into a leadership sight. Help yourself
2285,"Excellent approach to teaching Cava; i loved the hands on, concept challenges and nodules at the end of each course. I wish my professors in university were 1/2 as good as them."
2286,"The Loud Storage quit was very frustration. Lying in storage option, they wanted ""Loud"" with a capital ""C"" and ""Bigtable"" with a capital ""B"" and small ""t"" exactly like that, it took 5 tries to get the term correct and precisely the way they wanted it. His was unnecessary. Otherwise the course is a good introduction to GCP."
2287,Great course! Great hands-on learning.
2288,Moved it.
2289,"Video lectures were useful and thorough, but the assignment included some materials and concepts that were not even talked about, which poses a huge problem for beginners. Maybe try splitting up R Programming into two levels, one for beginners and another for more advanced individuals?"
2290,Very good course!
2291,"Excellent, closely packed course.. recommended for young college student to working persons whether job or business."
2292,Thanks for a grate learning experience.
2293,"Solid presentation of the material. Left me wanting more. Professor Fowler's enthusiasm is wonderful, and his presentation makes the material come alive."

2295,A basic overview of financial analysis starting from the structural underpinnings of accounting and moving into the framework of finance.
2296,"It would be the best staring point for people new to machine learning .The course was very clear and well organized .The assignment and quires have given me much deeper understanding of what is being told in the video lectures . The only thing which I felt could get better was using other libraries than graphlab ,libraries which companies use ."
2297,It's a great course to give you a real sense about opportunities and how to evaluate them.
2298,"Very nice work on the various fields of Linguistic, high level interviews, but rather laborious and time consuming quires."
2299,Excellent into to game development. Really well done and balanced to be interesting for all levels of skill.
2300,"Transvera, complete, great and p"
2301,Learned a lot
2302,Really hand overview of R and common development practices in R. SWIRL is definitely the one that must be attended in order to get best understanding on the subject if no prior experience in R.
2303,It's a very useful for all beginners and intermediate professional.Keeping Learning! Good luck to all.
2304,His course was simplifies enough for those who have limited knowledge of the computer.Of you can brows the site to register then you can finish the course.
2305,"I really liked the practical examples given by the instructor, Margaret Belong, and the interviews."
2306,Andrew G is am amazing instructor!!!
2307,"Thank you so much for the course. It is one of the best one I have had.The material was explained thoroughly, additional resources were extremely useful and the video provided sufficient examples. Also, the teaching style (and humor) are greatly appreciated.I learned a lot, while also consolidating my knowledge from Or. Rossiter's class (HTML, CSS and of).Any thanks!"
2308,Am not finishing it since in the test are missing a lot of sounds ..............
2309,"Only shows a bit of javascript, iss, and html shippers. Of you expect to learn from this course, dont bother they mostly refer you to schools.com. They assume everyone knows how to code in html, javascript and iss. It one point in the course the teacher says, if you don't know: Google, Yahoo,etc., but if you are going to have to goose 99% of things, it's painless taking this course."
2310,Quizzes were way too easy but great content!
2311,Assignment trading had a lot of technical bundles. Content on Ruby was solid. Nails coverage was very basic.
2312,"The course has opened my eyes to a lot of new concepts, workflows and tools in ArcMap. Challenging, fun, motivation and education. very pleased with myself for taking it on."
2313,Simply amazing! Everything in this course is so useful. Thanks for the journey.
2314,"The course was mostly well taught, and having the two programming assignment each week was useful. One so you could learn the technique, and another so you could learn the underlying algorithm. Some of the topics were occasionally light and too fast on the detail, but overall a very good course."
2315,"Great teacher, with a great sense of humor."
2316,That an amazing course!!!!!!!!!It first I skipped this and started R Programming. But then I thought let me just check it once and I am really grateful that I started this. I am looking forward to complete whole specialization
2317,It's a very good introduction to nutrition and food
2318,"Well done course. Or. Chamovitz is a clear and easy to understand lecturer with a passion for his subject. In each of the two courses on plant biology I have taken with him, a highlight is when he shows us his plant biology lab to see up close just how the science we have learned in the course is applied in the lab. Understanding Plants, Part 2 takes a detailed look at plant biology at the cellular level including a look at how genet affect flowering, understanding cellular energy production and ending with genetic modification. Lectures have in-lecture questions, which are very helpful, and the quires are fair. I recommend the course."
2319,very good and relaxing course
2320,"Very excellent course for beginners. Hope that the next courses will be at the same level!Two main problems, though: first, the autograder is very bad, should be much more flexible.Second, in my opinion, the homework should be more code-based, just like the final project."
2321,"That is a truly great course for beginners like myself. Easy to understand explanations, real life example and a wonderful instructor. Recommend! Thank you, Or. Him!"
2322,"His course was fun, interesting and well taught. I understood basic principles of how the sensory organs work and what effect can malfunctions have. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about how our body functions."
2323,Great and useful course!
2324,The course makes accounting interesting and especially the examples are very illustration. Virtual students bring some fun. The th week is however really integrated in the course structure.
2325,The lectures and topic covered in this course were very helpful in laying the foundation of the machine learning. Hope to see many more students being helped by these sessions. Thanks a lot to prof. Andrew for his time in putting up this course.
2326,Pretty good course to improve your basic english writing skill.
2327,"good course, thank you very much."
2328,I am learning a lot about how I can evaluate a research and how I can clean my experiments in order to achieve the best results
2329,Good One.
2330,Most reliable course I've done on Coursera! It applies to everyday social relationships.
2331,"I hope you make a longer version of this, maybe a part 2 and 3, it is so very well done and incredibly interesting I really enjoy the experience and learn many things of interest, the interviews where so good and helpful, keep up the great job"
2332,"Learned a lot from this beginner course in Python. A very good ice-breakers to getting into programming. Thank you, instructor!"
2333,excellent course to learn Python. Congratul
2334,"Getting harder than the first class in patron, a good course for first learner to get further patron knowledge.Doctor Severance is a vary qualified and humorous teacher, puts efforts into this courses.Of you have time, you can go through material efficiently and get the credit."
2335,West course for the beginners in Statistics.
2336,Vice lectures and tips to clean your grammar and write better essays.
2337,It's an amazing course with a great benefit and perfect instructor Or barbara recommend this course for any learner or student
2338,Very Good Work
2339,Informative and well laid out. Interesting case studies.
2340,Excellent material and teacher
2341,great into
2342,"I really enjoyed this course. Although I wish there had been more practices to install the firm knowledge of what the content was. Computer flashcards, or even extra little quires in each lesson would have been nice. Other than that, great course, great teacher, and great content! Thank you!"
2343,"A comprehensive introduction to programming in R, for people already experienced with numerical software like MATLAB and Mathematics it should be fairly easy to grasp some of the concepts of the language.The assignment are not difficult, though it requires the student to lockup for information in R forms, or stackoverflow.Finally, Roger is a great instructor in my opinion - he's very calm and explains some difficult aspects of the language in a clear way."
2344,"I enjoyed it like a child. I learnt a lot (it shows a lot of different subjects), the practices exercises are very fun (most of them)... The only bad thing I can say of the course is that it was made in 2011 and I do not know how many new things are missing."
2345,"The course gives u a number of examples, where u are just making a different choice to be not happy and u just have to lip the coin ...and everything would be AMAZING. A very good course, thank you professor and COURSERA"
2346,"His Course does a really great job in opening new perspective about photography.Each week stands for its own and yet they combine to give you a great understanding about photographs history, technique and artistic value.That I did not like that much, was that pretty much reading was required and that there was so much detailed information about the museums history included. That is why I rate 4/5"
2347,"I definitely like this course because: fresh information, great examples, interesting cases and cool teacher!"
2348,"I found the assignment challenging in the absolute best sense of the term, and therefore incredibly rewarding as well! Whenever I've gotten stuck, the answer was always in the course material somewhere, even if I didn't see it there at first. The discussion forms were extremely helpful, and I was astounded to see that that instructor were still actively monitoring the discussion forms and responding to student questions. I'm obviously not an expert in this field, but I've been an education before, and my own impression of the assignment was that they were extremely well designed: it was impossible to pass them without knowing what you were doing, the tools to approach them were always found in the lectures, and the challenge problems pushed your knowledge even farther. I would recommend the specialization to everyone. Additionally, I noticed that the content aliens well with other of&A syllabus I have seen in brick-and-mortar institutions, especially the first 3 or 4 courses. It's also a very nice luxury to be able to submit in Python. I have certainly learned a great deal."
2349,"Excellent course, even though I don't speak french, I learnt a lot."
2350,Great Course!! Some lectures were repetition. To I'd like to suggest the course advisers to cut down on those lectures. Overall it was a great learning experience!!
2351,Great course! Very clear explanations of sometimes complex concepts. A good mix between theory and practice.
2352,great Course
2353,Lots of knowledge
2354,"His course was essential to improve my vocabulary in my field of study, being so important in my future studies."
2355,"Wonderful, very information. Thank you for a great experience."
2356,"Excellent course!The ""why"" and the ""how"" are well explained.West course on AngularJS thanks to the instructor I guess:Now we're all expecting the MEAN specialization ;)"
2357,"Pretty Simple stuff - but would've been better if there was actually something we worked on in a group, or an actual project to 'plan' or want chart to create."
2358,Awesome Instructor
2359,hands down the best course for machine learning on course
2360,"Great way to start in programming and using Objective C. The course covers programming basis in Objective C, code and cocoapods, basic user interface and goes deep in key aspects, like memory management. Thank you!"
2361,"FUE of CURSO BASTANTE INTERESANTE Y MUY CLARO, of AGRADO MUCHO of VOLVERIA A TOMAR of CURSO MAS of ESTA UNIVERSIDAD."
2362,Its a great course.
2363,it is a good reason to learn about the basic knowledge of machine learning.
2364,"Excellent course, it was fun, enjoyable, easy to understand and useful in the major ESL context classes."
2365,Great calm organized instructor who helps put previous knowledge into logical perspective. Strongly advise this course for anyone who wants an overview of the time period.
2366,Great course. SEO is the future. Highly recommended launching point.
2367,Its Awesome experience
2368,"great course, very useful."
2369,"I really enjoy this introduction, I'm planning to keep taking the next courses"
2370,Moved it...one of the best project management courses ever. It so easy of follow this course and understand the structure of the PMBOK. Thank you.
2371,Lots of useful into
2372,"it's very detail, thank you onset university ^^"
2373,"Good Course, but in my perspective the teachers could explain better."
2374,I loved this course. I periodically come back to some of the lectures and reference them.
2375,"Uric is an amazing profession who is passionate about Digital Marketing, which is evident in the way he has structures the course, his knowledge and understanding of this revolving concept, and his ability to explain and teach the course in a"
2376,Reaching content is very practical and helpful in real world
2377,Great.
2378,"Excellent course, The only thing I regret is that I found this course only in my 32 :)"
2379,Excellent course! It provides you knowledge about how digital tools are changing the way we see marketing. I learned lots of new things. Great course if you want to learn about how marketing is changing in the digital age.
2380,Excellent. His course is really an opportunity to enjoy composing like bogart!
2381,"Full of information, great analysis, suitably detailed. A great personal touch as well. His requires attention and thought as a good course should. Highly recommended."
2382,His is a best course for the Beginners in the Communication.
2383,"There's a lot of theory for a beginner like myself, but it's presented nicely. I found written out lists and terminology very helpful. The RAPID methodology is very clear-cut, I'm sure it will be helpful 'in the field'. The vignettes are really self-explanatory, and help to put a visual to the theory. Overall a very well done course. Thank you!"
2384,Such a boring class
2385,"Great course, learning lots of new things although it assumes a level of mathematics much (much!) more elementary than mine, making some sections a little slow."
2386,High quality content and challenging assignment. Really good!
2387,"it's nice into to swift, but i recommend that you'd add reading the swift book from apple as people go through the course, even as ""to understand more"" option, thanks a lot for the course."
2388,"A lot of necessary information, good explanations."
2389,Very useful and well explained.
2390,"I thought it's going to be a little boring - I only took it ""for fun"", I don't even have a dog or plans or get one, but starting with week 3 and especially week 4 the bigger picture of evolution of humans and animals up to this day alone was worth taking this course. Definitely broadened my mind. Also very valuable were was the information about dog breed profile and what science can actually tell us about traits like aggressiveness and if they are related to breeds (they are not). Of you are looking for concrete dog training tips you won't find them, this course is more about giving an overview of the state of science, but it does so very well IMHO. You can take the course in two afternoon easily - I recommend against doing it over 8 weeks. The video are short, I watched them at 2 x speed mostly."
2391,Easy-to-follow explanations and great programming assignment. Overall an excellent course!
2392,Good Glass!!!
2393,"Excellent course. Contents, video, quires and programming exercises are very well contrived and conducted. I learnt a lot."
2394,"The course covered a lot of amazing things, but perhaps was too much too fast. I'm definitely not ready to move on to other things."
2395,Great specialization and wonderful instructor!

2401,Excellent lectures! In in-depth look at the subject handled in a very understandable way.
2402,Excellent introduction to R programming
2403,"Great course, Carry is a compelling presented and the course offers a good overview of a number of negotiation principles. His is a useful step on the way to becoming a great negotiator."
2404,It's an extremely basic introduction... which doesn't help in much for the next session (R Programming)
2405,"His course is quite helpful for me to figure out how should I organize my study and manage my life and work. It not only gives instruction on what an how to do, but also helps you to understand why you should do this."
2406,"Fantastic course! Or. More was engaging and information. He's also actually worked on a lot of the archaeological sites discussed in this course, which gives a nice perspective. Took him up, he's made some impressive discoveries in his own right. particularly about the factors that led to the fall of the Woman Empire. And the cameo appearances by his dog, Ana, were always appreciated."
2407,Amazing course. I didn´t know nothing about papers´format and now I can do it by my own.
2408,Very worthwhile course. Provides very clear and practical systems for tickling complex projects or subjects.
2409,"I have learned many practical skill in learning and text,which is really important to my study."
2410,It was really useful
2411,Thank you for this interesting course! it's really very helpful for me! can't break away from watching lessons!

2421,A very good introduction to R programming.
2422,"A Funnily Serious Approach to Python. Looking for a crash course to get you in on programming, jump on board"
2423,"His course was fantastic. It was the perfect balance of ""Oh this is easy, this is easier...wait what is happening"" Or Chuck Severance is a great teacher. I will look for courses taught by him in the future, starting with the rest of this specialization.Thank you"
2424,Moved the class. Feel like i definitely got what I needed to in order to learn.
2425,"Excellent. Really complete, fun and very information. I would totally recommend it!"
2426,"It's good, is the beginning to understand social media in a simple way.I learned interesting information and sites in this world of social media, however I think the should introduce you in a more personal way, give differences between taking this as person or as company"

2433,Two thumbs up!!!!
2434,"Great course.Starts from scratch, explaining how to set de environment to creating a working web pp"
2435,"I loved the course, because it was really practical. It was not just dry theory, we put every single thing into practice through various exercises. I did get solid understanding of the basic figures of DAWs. He were also able to learn from each other thanks to the peer review feature. It was an amazing and really helpful experience. I strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in music & technology. It develops musicianship in a different way and makes you more rhythmically precise. It also shows you how to use all of your resources (even your computer or cell phone) to connect with your passion for music and bring your creative ideas to life."
2436,"Good guide of Macroeconomics, but there are some sensitive contents for earners of China in the last few weeks."
2437,Very helpful contents with video of the length long enough to learn and short enough to keep learning interesting.
2438,Very modern subject!
2439,Perfect!!!
2440,Very interesting course
2441,Excellent course. Highly recommended.
2442,its a great course very important for my career
2443,I didn't come away with much understanding of how dogs think - I don't have much experience with dogs and I was hoping to learn about how to have a good relationship with a dog before I decide whether to get one - but the science is fascinating and I am glad I took the class anyway.
2444,His was a great course. I am ready for the next part.
2445,Vice Description with good exercises.Please provide a course for Angular 2 also
2446,Very helpful course that gives you tools to start doing your own projects. Moved the final project task!
2447,"Amazing course. Must for everyone on planet earth, really."
2448,"Fascinating historical, sociological, cultural, and literary journey through the Holocausts and the years preceding and following."
2449,Great Course!!!
2450,Good introductory course
2451,Very good start in the Data Science world
2452,West thing I've done for a looooong time !!!
2453,"The beginning is well prepared, interesting and information, the end is undercooked, subjective and repetition. He it 2 separate courses, I would rate them 5 and 2."
2454,Thank you very much for developing this course! There is so much that I have learned about helping client to identity their needs for a software and creating requirements that meet those needs.
2455,Absolutely amazing course! Everything is explained really well and I loved the content!
2456,Good Start for Digital Marketing Beginners.
2457,It's like super explanation
2458,"After also learning R from a non-Coursera MOOC, I find this Coursera course clung and distracting esoteric. Coursera occasionally clashes when attempting to pause or record the Python code that I've written, when that code runs fine on a regular IDE. His course in particular also includes lots of optional content that is either unnecessary (The West Face in the World video, for example) or for which it is unclear how to apply to Python (In interview with the inventor of query, for example). Additionally, the instructor often assign variable names that don't explain what the variable represents, which makes the video a bit harder to follow than necessary. Despite all of this, I have learned a lot from this course."
2459,Interesting and engaging - thank you!
2460,"Outstanding.The instructor has a great and rare skill: He is able to make calculus easier, interesting and fun. It's a pleasure to watch these lessons and listen to the instructor.I had other calculus classes in past (now I want to refresh my knowledge) and they leaded me to consider calculus boring, not so interesting, and sometime difficult. His course convinced me that I was completely wrong! Now I'm looking forward to watch the next lesson!To far, I really have to recommend this course to everyone. On't miss it!"
2461,i would highly recommended this course for everyone who is new to computer science. A good way to start
2462,Another great course by which!
2463,"this course is very important for me, it is a mixture of several sciences like energetic and chemical and other.. hope that i can carry for it !!"
2464,Amazing course
2465,His was my first course done through Coursera. The MOMA resources were great and I found the course really well curate allowing me to develop my understanding of photography that much better. The nodules moved me from one interesting aspect to another. Leading resources were excellent as well as all the other clips embedded in the program. Opportunity to provide and receive feedback was good and the online platform worked really well.
2466,Moved it! Is always really interesting and encouraging. And special thanks for keeping courses free! His is rare nowadays even when the platform consider itself as free :-/
2467,Great!!
2468,Feel Great To know about the tools.
2469,"I liked the house a lot, but I think the quires are very tricky and there are questions that you have to deduce more than to know. His is of as part of learning, but it turns a little difficult when English is not your first language. Also, there were some errors in the quires, especially in week 3 and 4. It's very interesting to listen to the informant, but I find difficult to answer the questions about them. I'm not familiar with those languages and it's very hard, and I think that's not the point of the course, like to know how to say ""grand"" in Abruzzese or how many ways there are to say ""son"" in Chinese. To, it may be taken into consideration. Anyway, I really liked the course and I hope it can grow for the best. Thank you!"
2470,"Run refreshed for someone that took Calculus 30 years ago. Great lectures and examples. Ruin answers don't always use the proper ""upper case E"" for e correctly, so be prepared to be marked down for correct answers sometimes (but you can ""correct"" your answers on retaken). It would be great to get this fixed!"
2471,"I'd encourage some refinement of the quires, for clarity purposes."
2472,Good projects. The video were a little too focused on watching someone code rather than instructions however.
2473,"Great, course. Excellent balance:Side scope, but with interesting practical and useful details.Vigorous, but easy to follow for those with less mathematical skill.Very complete theory, but with practical assignment using state of the art tools."
2474,"Good introduction, it would be even better with a few more presentation on SWIFT."
2475,"The course was great, I learned a lot from it!"
2476,"Excellent, Thanks to Coursera and the Professor for presenting this course."
2477,"Well constructed course that should lead the learner towards developing a policy position that will be characterized by rigor and coherence. Professor Griffiths is the star of this course, with a particular teaching style that conveys often complex ideas in a clear and forth-right manner. Highly recommended!"
2478,It's a great course with clear instructions and insightful practices. I learnt useful functionalities and tools that could be used in my future career as an accounting professional.
2479,"It's been a great inspiration to my dissertation!Thanks, Professor Fredrickson!Vanilla"
2480,You´re missing more practise exercises so we can study!!
2481,its a great course
2482,Great course!
2483,"Well taught topics. Lectures were delivered in clear terms without much ambiguity.Thanks to the instructor, thanks to Coursera staff."
2484,The material was always good (
2485,i recommend this course to any mechanical engineer out there. good basic
2486,"I think this course missed an opportunity to teach ways to run real life experiments in abstract of R-Studio. Instead, this was an R-Studio course in running experiments in abstract of what or why you would want to even approach these types of experiments. It didn't fit the specialization IMHO, but I did find it valuable as someone who is re-approaching and deepening my existing skilled."
2487,Amazing course
2488,It is useful.
2489,Great course. Learnt some really interesting new marketing concepts.
2490,It is a great course. You can learn the basic rules for punctuation correctly.
2491,"His course enables you to have basic knowledge into the what we call the internet, how it started, what technologies, protocol and how much research work has gone into the internet. also gives you an insight into the security aspect of the web which i believe every learned person should know."
2492,The homework is too time consuming.
2493,very good as into it has added to me a lot of values but still need for update it's tools and external resources
2494,It was a incredible experience . Thanks to Andrew G.
2495,West presentation for Antimicrobial.
2496,Well laid out and illustrated. I used this as a review of basic statistics concepts. Really enjoyed the course! Thanks!Money H.
2497,"It's a good course.Of I must complain about something is that, since the course covers a little too much too fast, the people that is not familiar with the subject might not understand the why or how of things explained."
2498,His course is brought with great enthusiasm and knowledge about the subject.When starting I was curious what there was to tell and if it would not be boring. Not at all!Thanks for this course!
2499,"The course can be summarized as: ""of, here are some tools that can be used: now read the documentation, Tack Overflow and some papers that we give you links to"". Each week there are just few video. That I expect from a Course are baby steps and clear guidance about good practices. Of course you can learn it all from the Internet - I am taking a Course to get something I will not easily find elsewhere: a good teacher who will guide me through optical approaches."
2500,"Good introduction to business merits. I was less enthusiastic about all the investment merits and formula, but that might just be me."
2501,Excellent video! The course is well-paced and thorough. Explanations and example problems are worked out in detail. His is one of the best on-line course presentations I have seen--and I have taken many online courses and MOOCs for both degree and non-degree study.
2502,"have not finished it yet , but a very good course so far, a lot theory mixed with exercises."
2503,Great and interesting course
2504,"easy to understand, intuition and information."
2505,Excellent course really thank you for sharing this knowledge and learning
2506,Highly recommended - efficient way to crash into Data Science.
2507,The course is very enlightening and easy to follow.
2508,"It has very useful tips on how to work smarter, not harder. I love this course, especially multitasking part. I have learned so much. Thanks!"
2509,"Teachers poorly prepared, explanations ambiguous, it seems that they didn't pay attention to examples and sound of the course.I love Back U written tutorials... way better than video."
2510,Great Introduction to Machine Learning
2511,His course was a great start to Foundations of Everyday Leadership. I actually learned tangible examples and technique. The assignment and quires were great and I can't wait to keep learning in the courses to come!
2512,Really well-paced course for someone with a medium of understanding of programming in a general sense. Him is a great instructor. Very needy but charming in his own way.
2513,"the best explanation so far , thank you !!"
2514,Wonderful. Very instructive and easy to follow.
2515,"The materials are good, but it felt like this class should have a been a 1-week introductory lesson to Data Science. It is definitely now a 4-week class, maybe a a 2-week one if you take very easy. You end up with a basic set for the next class. That I found very useful."
2516,"By far the best, most interesting, most valuable and also challenging course I have ever completed on course. Highly recommended!"
2517,Very nice! A lot of powerful tools to use in a daily life!
2518,I learnt a lot from Andrew. The course material is great. And I do have lots of practice in the lab. Thanks!
2519,David Underwood's Trophic Design course instruct earners on the industry's best design practices. It is a great course for both the novice with an interest in graphics design as well as experts who want to brush up on their design vocabulary and technique.
2520,Very interesting course.. :)
2521,His course felt much more structures than the first course in the specialization (which is only appropriate given the course title). Or Chuck is as personal as ever but the slightly longer lectures allow a bit more development.The only slight area for improvement might be in having some more challenging assignment--if you follow the lectures carefully and work though the examples that are shown the assignment are fairly straightforward.
2522,hope we can see more courses like this againthanks all professors for sharing this knowledgespecial thanks to Or Likes and Long Long University
2523,"Hard to understand professor. When one needs to read the english subtitles to understand the english the professor is speaking, it becomes inherently difficult in an online course. Also, please kill the into video for each course. It is completely unnecessary as the courses are labelled on the left side of the screen. Good material, but difficult to watch towards the end of the course."
2524,"I would like to thank Prof A and his team as well as Coursera team who have taken so many pains to device such a beautiful course. I strongly recommend this course for everyone. He all desire to live a happy and productive life. Somehow, we unknowingly make decisions which reduce our happiness. Similarly, our ignorance also stops us from taking a few more steps which can improve upon our happiness. Prof A's course actually target both- mistakes we make as well as positive steps we need to take."
2525,"His is an exceptional introduction to designing an organization. I greatly enjoy this iMBA specialization in Leadership and look forward to finishing all 7 courses. In one month, you learn a lot of very useful information through reading. excellent lectures, quires, case studies and written papers. I highly recommend this course."
2526,Professor Andy can tell a story and is the best damn Professor at wesleyan!
2527,A very good into into the process behind creating higher quality game rules and storylines. Also a lot of fun to watch. Definitely a good course for
2528,A good beginning to help structure the thinking process
2529,"His course was not only absolutely fascinating, it gave me a scientific perspective that I had not previously acquired throughout the rest of my education, training and experience as a professional dog trainer. I now always consider and apply the principles of cognition to my evaluation, training and behavior modification of dogs. I look forward to the future of this research."
2530,Awesome course. But i suggest more flexibility in deadline of submission of assignment.
2531,"Great class, great series. Still much to learn."
2532,Very good course. The only thing that I would suggest is an higher presence of operators in the forum. It would be very appreciated.
2533,His class was an amazing life changing tool that will forever impact the way I process information.
2534,His introductory course was amazing. It exceeded all my expectations about it. The course is developed for a smooth growth of knowledge through the weeks. The video and the interactive material helps the student to learn more easily.
2535,Great course on nutrition.It highlight the key concepts and gives a good knowledge of the food industry. It also enables us to understand the major problems related to food & health as well as how to tackle them.
2536,"I really liked this course and the elector. Everything is clear, very interesting and very useful. Even if you aren't a businessman, this course will teach you how to communicate with different people on variety of matters."
2537,Thanks for the course. It was really helpful to review some of the topics in basic epidemiology. The course could be more better with better presentation and by sharing more basic information in a simple way.
2538,Very introductory course. I learnt a lot from it. Will continue other courses as well.
2539,"His was a great specialisation taught by great professors, but I'm very frustrated that the final segment on deep learning was never finished! Coursera needs to fill this gap since it is huge important topic and isn't covered adequately in any other Coursera material right now."
2540,I loved the teaching. The video are great and the examples too... But I almost did not program! The course is 'too easy' and I feel I did not practice enough!
2541,Great start to understand Project Management
2542,West for foundation programming
2543,Very good structures
2544,"Very nice course, even if i'm sometimes overdue with the quires, i try to make my best to get them in time. Reccomend this course."
2545,Great course
2546,Good hand-on class
2547,"Great content and well presented, learned a lot and enjoyed the lessons. Thanks for making this available."
2548,"Concrete, easy and understandable!!!"
2549,"very well structures, delivered and animated. well researches and with good take away in practical business life"
2550,I really enjoyed this course! Learned lots of valuable concept for my business in an easy way. I suggest this course to every entrepreneur out there!
2551,"Not really about Product Management, but about Project Management"
2552,His is the only course on SAS(structures) available for free till date
2553,Good introduction to tools if you don't know them already. Otherwise very medial.
2554,A great class. Comprehensive and thorough with good guidance. Thanks!
2555,To far this course proves to be useful and interesting! I am enjoying taking this
2556,"Great teacher, wonderful content and examples.Thank you very much professor SiedelOnly one improving point: the video were often working badly (no audit or breaking the unload)"
2557,"From the lectures, we've got the technique of making various types of images and also the basic points of making images and compose images."
2558,"I loved this course that was my very first to follow in 2013 (and one of the first best courses available). Charles Severance brings us into the deep, fascinating and complex history of a tool that we so commonly use nowadays.Really a must-study to understand better our world and how all that thing works."
2559,"I enjoyed this course, it was challenging and well thought out. I am confident that I will be able to apply the concepts learned to my work. Buds!"
2560,A very interesting and information course. I really enjoyed furthering my knowledge of Unity. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning how to make games.
2561,"the peer feedback is not working that well. the time range is very short and the rating quality varies, so resubmissions of assignment can mean you have to re-knoll for the following course and lose your short."
2562,Really good course. Clear and well prepared
2563,"His part helped me channel my relevant experiences and things that I learned from other courses in of/of, especially from typography and imagemaking. It's nice to put your skill into practice through learning by doing, and have an actual portfolio after the course. It's also a good practice to rate others from draft 1 to 5, feedback from peers weren't always relevant to me but mostly helpful in solidifying my capstone project."
2564,The course is really beneficial and I did enjoy the challenging problems designed for the course.
2565,Great course!! a lot of great hints!!
2566,Excellent course. A great way to introduce to Buddhist with a scientific approach.
2567,i am loving it. Thank you
2568,I would apply for this course again and again. Wonderful experience. The best course ever taken! Congratulations to all the team!
2569,"His course is awesome. Seriously! I'm not Jewish. I have been studying the North with a Jewish friend, and I am learning Hebrew. His course went beyond expectations in providing a frame of reference for understanding not only what the Aloud is, but understanding that it is accessible to any who study it! Grateful to the presented for their energy and presence."
2570,"Sections are good except it was quite hard to listen the guest lecturer. The material was interesting, but the form and the way he said the information was difficult for me.Quizzes are not very information, and sometimes seem to be too tricky without any value to this thickness.Fig thanks to Dan for this course."
2571,"One of the most thorough and fair teachers I have ever had. His course was well out of my wheelhouse, but I felt empowered rather than defeated with each exercise and before I knew it I was conversing about current events that previously would have gone well over my ahead. Prof Almeia is the best!"
2572,"I learned a great deal in this course, whilst enjoying the lively lectures and interesting, fun projects. Definitely highly recommend for those interesting in computer programming, whether new to the field or (like me) refreshing old skill. Thanks to all the lectures for this great introduction - I'm looking forward to the rest of the specialisation. :)"
2573,Great class from practical point of view. It would be great if there where more video with deviations.
2574,His is an excellent information and writing about ebook which will help me to study further.thank you
2575,very practical knowledge with clear and concise suggestion and advice. Thank you.
2576,"Engaging and challenging, this course was an excellent introduction to Fig Data!"
2577,I recommend for everyone that want to start programming in Python
2578,Andrew is a great professor! The lessons are clear and really well structures. The overall course features a balanced fraction of theory and practical hints to have a 360° overview on machine Learning. Thank you professor!
2579,absolutely love it !!
2580,"His is a great course. I love the step by step teaching method and detailed explanation. Despite the step by step method, the lecturer never fails to boris us because he always gets right to the point."
2581,Awesome One... One of the best I've ever taken
2582,Good for beginner. Very easy to follow.
2583,Great reflections on some wonderful oral history research.
2584,I loved this course. I useful and practical. The explanation from both the speakers and graph is clear. Learned a lot. Thanks!Encourage to have more such courses.
2585,"Moved this course, I am about half way through it. I am an history bluff and this course managed to hold my interest. The course is mostly made of interesting video clips of spaceflight with narration. I thought I had seen most video of space flight but I got to see some rare clips of the soviet space program and learn some very interesting chapters of the race to conquer space that I was unaware of.There was an earlier review complaining of the links in the video - but I got a message from the instructor that supplemented materials were initially missing and have now been added to the course. The links are available in the of after each chapter with some nicely done press presentations.Overall a very well made course that hooked me on to space flight, some chapters of this should be required viewing in high school/college courses."
2586,It's a good course for introducing students to html. it gives a broad into but you have to take it slow
2587,"The best Machine learning course I ever took. I compare it very favourably to Jeff Week's course, or New G's course - which are both good in their own right.A lot of effort went into making this a really good course. I very much recommend it."
2588,"Course reaches Python Hands in a very practical way and I'm sure now having learnt it I'll use the skill. But this course wasn't taught well. Meekly assignment asked questions about skill that had not been taught yet. The course coordinators didn't respond or help in the forms, The topic area deserves more in depth video lectures and discussion. All the above basically means that passing the weekly assignment takes longer than you may assume. Had the course been taught and tested more effectively then doing the weekly assignment would less frustration and time consuming.Basically the course is good, but it requires much more work and research because of the poor way its caught and monitor by staff."
2589,Very easy and fun. Sides are fantastic.
2590,"Very well explained, great teacher!"
2591,"Really helpful course! Thanks, Coursera!"
2592,Good introduction to platon and data science
2593,Very good didactics. It was a pleasure to participate in this course. Thanks for providing such good material.
2594,"I think it is a very good course, but for me, it was too dense, which led to me not finishing it. More emphasis should be on repetition and deepening of the acquired knowledge."
2595,Absolutely fantastic! Very effective in explaining a very technical topic.
2596,To far the professor is the most engaging path professor I have ever had. Very easy to follow the examples.
2597,Very good course. Since I've only done the audit I haven't practiced with the assignment (probably going to do so on my own time with a friend though).
2598,"Signature class! Not only introduce some basic and useful tools, but also talk how and when to use it."
2599,"His is an outstanding introduction to lesson planning. It covers the subject in far more detail than did my graduate teaching course. I would have given 5 stars but still struggle a bit with the presentation style of the instructor. On't let this put you off though as that is very much a personal opinion and the material is excellent. For those who have followed the earlier courses in the specialization, I should warn that this one is much more difficult, particularly for those without prior teaching experience, and far more practically based."
2600,Great course! Presented in a way that is exciting and easy to follow. Perfect for those just beginning in astronomy and a great refreshed for those with more experience.
2601,"His course was amazing and easy to understand. By first encounter with Organ and i can easily identify and read words and sentences. Thanks to the instructor, she did a great job!"
2602,"Robert Miller is always trying to set examples of his lectures and placing the facts in history, so we get great context."
2603,I have started loving. Thanks Or.Chuck
2604,Good for states. Instructor is very good.
2605,"very easy to pick up, wish more exercise would be nice"
2606,"Thank you, a great course and great professor"
2607,"His course is great, I would recommend it to anybody who wants to better understand the world around them."
2608,fresh and reliable information i loved it! thanks
2609,"I have learnt a lot, thanks."
2610,Fantastic course. his allow you to become an strategic business analysis consultant
2611,Very good course!
2612,I can not wait to continue a Life of Happiness and fulfillment with more tools to utilize helps us to train ourselves to be more content
2613,Great class!
2614,very nice introduction and Or. An G Harris is very good
2615,"very practical, relevant, and inspiring!"
2616,Great course for first exposure to machine learning!
2617,Excellent Technique and Tools for improving your learning.
2618,Very good course!
2619,His was a very interesting class.
2620,"Great course, bringing together practical international experience and basic theory!"
2621,"great course for beginner programming in patron,Thank Coursera :)"
2622,Very information course
2623,Excellent course. Carry is a great teacher and the quires and assignment give a great opportunity to consolidate our learning. One recommendation I would give is to try to make the forum more useful maybe by including was o including senators that response on the course contents and not only on technical issue
2624,Very interesting. The quires after each model compel me to learn and research more.
2625,"His course has been very good, and i will recommend it to anyone who wants to learn functional programming."
2626,"Really well explained and accessible, could even be a bit more complex or at least more detailed concerning theoretical guarantees of machine learning at some points."
2627,"Its ok and I liked the exercises, but I think you see to many themes and there is almost no practice for them. Its hard to learn them."
2628,Excellent! Time consuming and difficult but excellent!
2629,"Most of the lectures were very rushed and brief. They quote facts and names and rarely bother to elaborate on them. The ""interviews"" that often serve as a second lecture for the week mostly repeat the first lecture /average duration for both - 5 minutes/Almost no reading materials in english.The translations in English isn't very good.The peer review processes for the final assignment is flowed, since you will be given to review works in spanish and english, with no option to""skin"" to an essay in a language you understand. The trading criterion is also flowed. For example the required length of the essay does not seem to be obligatory.The staff rarely others with answers in the discussion forumAll in all it is an interesting topic, and a good starting point for your own research. Badly, It is one of the worst courses i have taken part in."
2630,Going it plainly for the purpose of specialization certificate :)Very eager about cava courses though :)
2631,Very good course
2632,"His was my least favorite of the course. The questions were out of order, the video and lectures were terrible and dry"
2633,Great!
2634,it is really help me to improve myself.
2635,"Although I already had much of the conceptual framework and general history of the course, the presentations filled in the missing detail of events and causes. Beautifully illustrated with art and maps from the different ears."
2636,I loved this course. It really gets into the meat writing. I look forward to the other Creative Writing Courses and recommend it to anyone interested in writing.
2637,very good course
2638,Very clear and useful course for studying SEM model!
2639,"The course helped me understand the concepts of the machine learning from the very rudimentary level. It also laid the foundation for understanding and dealing with the practical implementation of the machine learning algorithms and their implementation in big data which eventually elevated my understanding of applications dealing machine learning with Fig Data.Thanks to all the senators and instructor for everything- the teaching materials, quires, assignment and hands-on; everything was awesome."
2640,I finished watching all the lectures in a weeks time. I was truly hooked to the subject. Paul Gloom is an excellent professor and his books are well written and interesting. I truly recommend this course.
2641,Well presented -- I love the idea of combining science with history and meditation.
2642,"The best course I have taken so far in Machine Learning. Lots of insight on also, their resemblance, their limitations, when to use them or not, and some rough intuition to present them."
2643,"I love the instructor, she knows her material and she facilitate the information in a manner that is engaging. I am excited to complete this course."
2644,"A solid introductory course, with some interesting course materials and thought-provoking questions."
2645,Perhaps the best course i have completed on Coursera. I absolutely love An Grossman's teaching approach. I can only applaud the care and effort that has gone into designing this. I would eagerly join any course that An reaches in future
2646,"Very practical, concise, lots of examples."
2647,"One of the best courses i have ever attended to.Full of useful information. I can't remember a session that was dull, or out of context.Vice pacing, application of the principles and technical know how in the projects.After this course i have a very good understanding of the UNITY development environment.It's a must if you consider a career in game design.Useful for both technical and non-technical persons."
2648,His course changed me a lot.
2649,very attractive to me and I can get so many things with the funny process
2650,Very challenge and midst to functional/of way
2651,Over wondered how much deductible you should pay for your insurance? That drove the recent sub-prime mortgage crisis? how you can improve your chances of avoiding bias in making financial decisions? Well then this course is for you ! Very well presented notes and did
2652,"Congratulations for this well-designed, information and extremely education course! The language diagnostic way of presenting and explaining these basic but important algorithmic technique provides an extremely useful way to better understand and further elaborate these methods by using the programming language of our choice. Of course, some programming experience in at least one language is needed, but this course can also provide a great lab to start learning others. The programming assignment and the way you have designed them (time/memory constraint) are ideal to learn designing these algorithmic technique correctly and efficiently."
2653,"I am eager to down what happened between 1760 to 1910,several years.as you said,I am also eager to know how those things take place,thanks this course!"
2654,"Forms were poorly organized and not well participated in.There was no forum topic for the honors assignment.Honors assignment appeared to require unit, which was not stated in the course requirements.Honors assignment was due too early in the term."
2655,"His is good content, but way too broad and general to be considered a proper introduction. The course was too easy for my taste to be considered worthy of a mortification."
2656,His course is Concise and give you what it promises you. Have lots of comprehensive exercises which are really helpful.I highly recommend it for anyone who has a moderate to severe doubt about English Grammar and Punctuation.
2657,Really good!! I enjoyed a lot!! ;)
2658,Really enjoyed this class. Must wish it could've gone into more statistical depth.
2659,Must finished this course and I enjoyed it very much. Would like to thank prof. Zelikow for wonderful and very insightfull presentations! Would recommend to everyone
2660,"I have a background in music education, and wanted to dive into my husband's world so I took this course. It has really helped me to think more like my husband. I have started to communicate with him about his work instead of just listening intently and trying to understand on my own. I expect the other courses to continue helping me move into his world so I can share in his passion."
2661,"It's a great course,"
2662,His is a great course. Students learn a lot about themselves and others that helps build lasting happiness through internal control and building strong healthy relationships.
2663,"To learn your most favorite major is the best thing in the world, tanks for teach me what I most need in my life"
2664,Excellent course. Jonathan is a great pianist and a great instructor.
2665,It is very good course and i learned many new Mechanics. It will be very benefit in my current job.
2666,"Is a recent electrical engineer graduate in search of something different from my life's work, picking up the guitar was more than worth while, and this course was more than supplementary to that decision. Thaddeous young was great at introducing me to chords"
2667,great presentation
2668,Great instruction and truly engaged students. I enjoyed this class very much and find I draw on it all the time in my work. Thank you!
2669,"One of the best courses I have undertaken till now.Prof. A is very charismatic and the exercises/assignment involve a lot of fun, innovation and creativity and helps to spread happiness in our and other's lives."
2670,These courses are great because they teach all the basis that other courses overlook.
2671,Good introduction to very basic stuff. I skipped many video and found the same information on the internet. Of it wasn't part of the specialization I wouldn't pick it.
2672,Great course. His is my second Python course and I was taking it as a refreshed and learned new ways of approaching programming.
2673,Excellent course! Great way to begin your work with Python
2674,I'd give a 10/5 if it was possible. I had a splendid experience during this course. Yakov did a great job explaining the basis also touching important points. I love this and highly recommend to anyone looking to start a new career in Web Development.
2675,"It was a little different than I expected (more litigation and law in general), but A LOT of new information nevertheless."
2676,"Great introduction course with good organized detail.Although I am an experienced C/C++ programme,I think this should be still very easy for beginners."
2677,Looking forward to learning more from these astounding teachers.
2678,Really worthy for a financial individual.
2679,"Very good course. A bit fast paced for someone with no significant programming experience but as stated in the description this is not a beginners course. Nevertheless, the concepts are explained in depth in the lectures and the assignment which are quite challenging even for someone with good programming background provide great insight to the issues discussed in the lectures. Highly recommended."
2680,"Really enjoyed the methodology and the subjects. For me that didn't know anything about the topic, it opened up a whole new world."
2681,"Very nice course. I enjoyed and learned a lot! Must to give some comments to improve it, it will have been nice to have more clinical cases during the course. But, I like it a lot."
2682,It is a well done course and the topic it is very interesting. I sincerely recommend it.
2683,"Really good course, and structures in a way that you have to do a lot of thinking, reading, and research for yourself - forcing you to learn and explore."
2684,I enjoyed learning the different ways to write an essay and the differences as per each type.
2685,Its a great start for strategy enthusiast!
2686,"It was a little long before getting to the REALLY interesting stuff, but it's a good course for what you pay. I wish there were a follow up one, like a level 2.I also wish that Brian didn't refer to groups of dogs as ""dog packs"" as dogs are not pack animals. His leads to confusion as dog owners will then believe that they need to be a pack leader and everything that comes with that stereotyped. I also wish he didn't focus so much on the idea that dogs are from wolves, because again, many people revert to ""this is how wolves are so this is how i treat my dog"" it leads to confusion. Must read the comments on some threads. Even while doing this course, people were saying how they need to be a pack leader and how they follow what Dear Milan does.However, for those of us that know there is a difference, it was interesting to learn more about the differences between wolves and dogs. I just wish the course focused more on dogs"
2687,I liked the course. The only problem of this course is it was a little bit advanced for a person like me who did not have any idea about data science. Otherwise it's a good course to start learning about data science.
2688,The West Glass Over! Or. Chuck you're the man!
2689,"His course is perfectly designed and give an intuition on how machine learning works in application. The exercises especially the programming assignment, helps apply the knowledge and see the result and helps understanding the concepts.Buds!"
2690,A very interesting and complete course on the argument.
2691,Excellent. Very deep approach for des reaching ruby.
2692,"Very good course. Clear and experienced teachers/facilitators, very good reference resource and explicit and efficient video with a good method including task to fix the learned topics.Complete and organized course structure for incremental learning about software process models."
2693,Very useful course to understand role of slaveholder! I suggest it!
2694,Great teacher. Subject matter well presented.
2695,"Excellent information, current, video are engaging. Great course to start the specialization."
2696,A glimpse to our mental traps in the field of Finance
2697,Good course. It was really helpful for me.
2698,One of the best courses.
2699,I really enjoyed it. thankyou.
2700,"in my opinion, with more details, we could learn more about R"
2701,"Good start, clear information. Glad i took it :-)"
2702,Good class
2703,It would be nice to have more complicated assignment which push brain to work harder
2704,Comprehensive for software engineers designing machine learning systems
2705,Give Stars - Excellent Course. Very Informative
2706,"His is the first time that I have enrolled MOOC course online, I have to say it's awesome, I learned a lot From ASU, this course is impressive and useful, Or. Have is the best tutor I've never seen who makes the class so interesting and I am eager to learn more."
2707,"Great courses, extremely clear. Thanks a lot to both Or Laugh and Or Iyengar."
2708,Haven't seen an online resource that has taught GIS better than this. And by a long shot! Moved the course. All courses have been awesome and build on themselves well
2709,I really enjoy how in-depth the lessons are. I have four small children and have learned that they eat and drink what we do because they love to mimi us as their role models and if we would not want a bunch of june in our bodies why should our children. His world is so fast paced and fast food jennies yet we can still make even small choice that are healthy for us like maybe a drilled chicken or a salad if we absolutely have to have something while out. Otherwise it's much better and cheaper to cook at home and have family time
2710,Good one
2711,"The course is well suited to the developing countries, since are the ones highly challenged with defective sanitation technologies and systems."
2712,Really good starting point for R
2713,"Homework was very nice, but strong accent of lectures impeded me"
2714,Door quality audit. Monotonous lecture style with frequent inaccuracies in delivery (says one thing but actually means another). I found my motivation and performance dropped sharply in contrast to prior lectures in this series.
2715,A nice short introduction to the energy sector. Highly recommended.
2716,it is practical course.
2717,very interesting course like to learn new things and i like physics .Thanks all of you .
2718,Very of centered and assignment not well connected to the lecture
2719,All assignment giving you more insight on your personality had to be purchased. I did not really feel like a free course .... too
2720,"Overall another great learning opportunity. Appreciate the relevant models and temples to aid in identifying and reaching top talent. 4 stars as there are some opportunities to improve the delivery of the first lesson and I am not a fan of video tape assignment. That said, would highly recommend - the course learning are incredibly relevant and will support you in making a difference in the work lives and careers of your team."
2721,Not an easy topic but presented well with more than one perspective. Slightly more difficult than One.
2722,Excellent material. The weeks on measurement and smiling went a bit too fast but otherwise the course is fantastic.
2723,Really Amazing and Great Course !!! Thank you Professor Uric for all the hard work you put in this course ! you really opened my mind to many new things that i could have never learned or enjoyed in my local education! THANKS!
2724,The professor was very engaging. I would like to take another course with him.
2725,this course is very good
2726,Not as interactive and engaging as many other courses on the webster but still very information and easy-to-follow. I took this with little to none knowledge on economics and I manage to go through and got interested in further study the subject.
2727,Very good professor. Everything is quite easy for understanding. Thank you!
2728,His course has added a lot to my knowledge and i do recommend it to anyone who is new to programming and want to learn patron! Special Thanks for Or. Charles for his great way of explaining!
2729,Great course for a budding data analyst/scientist
2730,"The accent,presentation & stuttering is too cloudy & not suitable for foreigners"
2731,"A tough course,yet good one if you are persistent. The materials and some Quizzes seems out of touch,you will be searching all over the web for answers because the lectures simply wont have those answers,His is a fairly high level into to mobility ,you must be persistent .to complete this ."
2732,It is great to have the opportunity to evaluate and put in to practice what I have learnt in this specialization. Thank you!
2733,It is very good
2734,"His is an excellent course not only help one learning how to learn but many of the skill taught in this course such as using Pomodoro time to help focus and overcome difficult problems, breathing exercise to calm our panic, exercise and good sleeping habit to help memory as well as better judgement can benefit us throughout our lives."
2735,The education is really wants to be boring. The questions doesn't reflect the material. Why am I learning so much about a dog or who is whose relative in a bioelectricity course?
2736,"Is a person who has rarely studied history, I found this to be an excellent overview of key historical dates, people and ideas. Thank you for making this such an effective and helpful set of presentations."
2737,A clear and systematic study of project management basis!
2738,"I thought the video for this course were appropriately concise and well-done. The projects were about the right difficulty and length (although the one for week three was more time consuming than expected). They were interesting enough to keep engaged. I think the span of topics was also useful and appropriate. I would have liked if the autograder gave more detailed output on what was wrong with a submission. I also think it would be extremely beneficial to see the ""right"" ways of solving this problems after a submission is completed. I'm sure I didn't use the optical hands approach in some instances, as it stands I seem to have no way of knowing and improving my knowledge beyond getting a passing grade."
2739,His is my first MOOC and it has been a pleasure. Our instructor was creative and effective at the same time :)
2740,"Perfect courses! By this course, I have learnt many things about Machine Learning. True, it is so wonderful that Andrew G could take many abstract concepts into some straightforward things, thanks a lots! I can guarantee that if you could insist on completing this course totally, you would find you've mastered many useful knowledge. Of course, knowledge is endless, if you're really interested in this field, then go for it by as many methods as possible you can find, and don't restrict yourself to this course."
2741,I totally enjoyed the course and it really opened up my mind to think in new ways. Absolutely recommended to take this course!
2742,"I gained a solid conceptual understanding of Machine Learning, its terms, problems, and solutions. But I consistently felt prepared for applying it in Active.The audit is poor and frustration, which the course addresses in the first week by essentially saying, ""deal with it"". Also, the instructor has no idea what ""intuition"" means, but uses it incessantly. It's a small nag, but it build up over 11 weeks."
2743,"Excellent and useful course.Some of the materials covered in Week 4 should be distributed to earlier week(s). The current Week 4 video coverage, quires, and the course project on accelerometer data is too much for the week, esp. if the student has lockup and review some key concepts from the resource links in the video sides. Video lectures are information and easy to follow, although somewhat rushed in Week 4."
2744,Great Course!
2745,His is a wonderful course. His is very precise and practical course about being active which promotes the benefits of being active. Part of it this course also speak about different health condition and how a person can be active in that situations too.
2746,Good delivery of the course.
2747,"Some things are useful, such as the table ""task list"", but I would say there isn't enough of this type of help. It would be better if there were more tables like that.Also, more information and help is needed on how to accomplish multitasking. Unfortunately, multitasking is necessary in many environment, from office to home, and even a housewife has to multitask. One of the most important aspects of multitasking that was not covered and that is really needed is how to multitask in a situation of ""housewife"" type of work. Examples of this include engineering, molecular biology, chemistry, work in a lab in general etc. You constantly need, like a housewife, put something for a chemical reaction (or start sundry, or put a cake in the oven), and then you have to wait for the chemical reaction to occur. And during that time when you wait, you need to keep this going ""sundry"" task in your head, so that you don't forget to take it out later on time. And when there are more than 3-4 tasks like that, and they all have this ""pick me up and start on me later"" thing, they are all in your head and they take up all your memory and resources. And the worst part is, it's difficult to schedule them, because you need to schedule not how long will something take, not in a linear fashion, but how long will multiple parallel things take. I would really appreciate it if there was something about this topic in a time management course."
2748,"the course material is really interesting , but it seems to be a little bit hard ."
2749,"The class It's really clear and simple.Very week you can put the information to work on the assignment, that in my case made me put my creativity out there, have fun, discover my abilities and create really cool stuff.I learned with the recommendations of my classmates and I also learned by review them. I feel I learned a lot on a few weeks.I really loved this class, very, very much!"
2750,"The information was great. By only complaint would be how dry the lectures were, and I do not meant the content, I meant the delivery."
2751,"One of the best courses on Coursera that I've taken. Professor D purposefully addresses MOOC students and know who to motivate in front of the camera. Small talks of personal life (I think students get to know his wife's and daughter's names!) and the camera man (also all the crew showing up at the last lecture) make this MOOC EXTREMELY real!Besides the great pedagogical approach, each week there is a real case and a Type interview with a business leader/ entrepreneur whose case is under exploration. His further adds authenticity to the course! Week one content's, for me is the best; while the other weeks are also great. Lots of metaphor (outran the bear, gas pedal, worry plate...) as well. In short, the content is way beyond expectation. Highly recommend for those who run a private business!#fullofenergy #exemplaryMOOC #thankyou #D #course"
2752,One of the best online courses I took so far!
2753,great foundation course!
2754,Extremely information and fun! Perhaps update some material with the latest findings (e.g. results from the Dawn mission to Teres as well as more details on the elusive Planet 9).Thank you nonetheless Prof. Grown for sharing your contagious enthusiasm for the science of solar system with us!
2755,For any person that wants to learn more about clean energy this is the course you might want to grow your knowledge
2756,"His is one of the best things i've ever seen on this matter. Prof Andrew's method os explanation is quite useful and easy to understand, even if your not totally familiar with the subject."
2757,"I only finished first week but will comment nevertheless, this is a great course. I had other moods and wish i had started with this. Of you are passionate about learning this course is a must."
2758,extremely beneficial and high quality education
2759,"Vice introduction to R language.Because one thing can done by several way, and after learning about different methods, in beginning it's becoming confusing what to use."
2760,"Amazing, complex, interesting, professional."
2761,It's better to just read the transcripts than watch the painfully boring video. Of you don't have an interest in law then you won't find this class very interesting. I thought the information was good but could have been better presented.
2762,Chuck is a great teacher - but make sure you read the book too.
2763,"Reaches the basis of buck and boost converted (twitching voltage regulatory). Basis like how the twitching duty-cycle determines the output voltage, and how the essential components affect cripple in the voltage and current.The homework assignment are challenging and meaningful without being enormous undertakings.Assumes frenchman or sophomore-level electronics engineering knowledge (or maybe the first chapter of The Art of Electronics). Assumes familiarity with the basic concepts of calculus (what derivatives and integral are). Homework requires some algebra (algebra manipulation) but no difficult calculus sort of algebra. Homework does require thinking outside of the box a bit; the solutions to some problems are not completely obvious from the lectures."
2764,Excellent for Clinical social worker and psychologist if want to use intervention with animal assisted therapy
2765,It is an excellent course. Professor arrange has an extraordinary skill to facilitate the understanding of the fundamentals of fluid-solid interactions. Very week of the course combined theory and experimental demonstrations in a very balanced way. The visual images accompanying the equations and the summarise at the end of the sessions are great course asset. Without any doubt I will knoll in a future sequel of this course.
2766,"Very good course, perfectly interlocking theory and practice of statistics decision making."
2767,of WAS JUST AMAZING.
2768,very cool
2769,"Absolutely great course.His course has de-justified the basis of accepting web-data and has least helped me realize the power of patron to access it.Faculty, Well delivered ! you have kept the discussions lively and have made me eager to learn more."
2770,West course. Very easy to learn new language with this course.
2771,"I struggle with Epidemiology and Statistics, and this course helped me to get a better understanding of the theories of Epidemiology and helped me to use it in practice. Thank you for putting so much time in building these nodules."
2772,"I really like the way this course was done. It was full of explanations, metaphor, and allegory, such as learning methods they have presented. The MCQ at the end were great, and all the MOOC was done according to the learning concepts they wanted to present.Thank you :D"
2773,"Great course! Love the video - the professor is great and really understands the material. I love his presentation, as he keeps it fun and interesting and most importantly - engaging.10/10 would take again"
2774,"Of you are keen to learn the subject of finance , look no further."
2775,Great. Concise.
2776,Excellent!Head the book with the lectures.Inspirational. Thought provoking. Informative. Challenging.Enjoy :)Enemy K
2777,Vice efficient course. Some of the video struggles with colour contrasts.
2778,His course provided me a good amount of information to use the Arduino Board.
2779,"Of you have taken Andrew G's machine learning class, it's not necessary to take this one."
2780,"Great ! The animation of the course is punch and highly participation (lot of peer grade assignment), the contents are of high level - and Have is driving the course with enthusiasm and joy recommend !"
2781,I am a Medical graduate with a keen interest in Diabetes. I took this course hoping to streaming my understanding of the process of innovation. I must say that the course helped me organise the often overwhelming amount of information that is to be understood in this process. It also helped me develop a grounded overview to learn further. The supplementary resources provided for reading were also very valuable. Deepest gratitude!
2782,Wonderful!! Thank you...
2783,Excellent information
2784,"the materials and video are valuable,"
2785,"The course is very good to introduce people with hands usage, however, the autograder and little data issues on the assignment costs a lot of learning time."
2786,Great course! thank you very much Or Chuck
2787,West course I've taken so far!!
2788,I recommend this course to all beginners programme
2789,Capstone project methodology is a bit disappointing.The previous nodules were great
2790,"The quality of the lectures and teaching was the lowest i have ever seen on Coursera. I wanted to do the whole specially, but after this first one i was so disappointed that i will stop. The assignment were overlay complicated and demanding for no real reason. I have used Coursera for years and this is the first time I have wanted a refund."
2791,It's pretty awesome that I've learned quite many great thought from this lesson. To that I am able to think and apply in my current job. Thanks!
2792,"Sometimes it's not important to be able to of the subject, but just understand the language to ask the right questions. His was an information and helpful insight into optimization fundamentals."
2793,"Simple, easy to follow, information, unapproachable, suppurative"
2794,Good into to HTML CSS and of. The professor also provides a big picture so you understand the context of what you are doing. His course seems to target absolute beginners since there is a lot of hand-holding.
2795,Thank you very much for the course.
2796,Pretty good explanation.
2797,His really helps a lot. Thank You Team.
2798,His is my first course in Coursera and it is very good
2799,GREAT AND I LEARNED A LOT.I of PAY FOR of NEXT TIME I TAKE THIS COURSE
2800,"The course is really what I wanted: It covers theoretical and practical aspect of cryptography. The exercises are also very well designed, although, I found some of them quite difficult.Overall, I would recommend this course to a friend."
2801,Wonderful course. Great instruction on very interesting topics. Sides support learning and a good amount of information every week. Thanks for the organization and delivery of this course.
2802,The coursework was very straightforward and prof. Anger made it easy to understand using applicable real-world scenario.
2803,Very Good information
2804,"His is my feedback as a Beta-Fester for the course:Week Of thought that the video were clear, well organized and flowed well from topic to topic. There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratio.That was missing for me was some in-line quires. Not the “tell me what I just told you type” but rather ones that make you think. To, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students “play” with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two… “change the assumption about X to <this value>. That is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?” I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. His is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Rushed was the fact that he had examples throughout the video that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the video and going “yeah… that makes sense. I understand…” I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don’t find the in-line quires valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quires as a whole or just in-line quires that simply require “narrowing” something said in the video.I’m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quit might provide some numbers for He-severed Met Income, Tales, Average Total Sets and Average Shareholder’s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratio in the Upon Analysis. And maybe a “think about what this means” type question that is not necessarily “marked” but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Roof Function spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratio and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Nation. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratio. For example, what would happen to the Cross Margin if Roof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Must something to engage people with the materials.All of the video offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they “go look at the spreadsheet”. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more “hand holding” and “direction” in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Rushed expects students will watch the optional video anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little “scar” for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidity an understanding of the spreadsheet.I’m wondering if an in-quit question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financial for Roof Function and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Must some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quires – this not only breaks up the longer video and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quit for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quit effectively reinforced the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quit to quit. In many of these on-demand courses, the quit questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not reading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 – Revenue After Wash Collection at 7:39 – talking about Days Learned Revenue and mentions that an “increase means slower future recognition”. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 – no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Eyford’s Saw really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures – some in-line quit questions might help. His would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quit Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students – particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall comments enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratio. I know that the ratio are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemented information about how to use the ratio.I think in-line quires or practice questions would be helpful for students – perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don’t need to be long or complicated – just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to “play” with the spreadsheet. Any will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of “missing” it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a “playground” sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratio without having to move from one spreadsheet to another – so, a combination of the Original tax and the first two columns of the Nation tax. You might even want to have two columns for the ratio – one for the ratio with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Nation and the CommonSize tabes were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with of-EXCEL but I don’t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. In the Valuation tax, I was wondering if the numbers in Now 41 should be highlight in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific video where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course. I hope that my comments are helpful and that I have not missed too much that causes students issues as the course goes live."
2805,I think this course will be an added value to any one has interest to understand the of principles with more focus in the Vague.
2806,Great explanations for most subjects. The tests are significantly more complicated than the exercises covered by the lectures.
2807,"i would like to thank all the persons who were involved in the implementation of this course, it was very helpful for my work in the child protection field."
2808,West and complete course series in course era. The best course staff of any course I have taken. The best quality of instruction and knowledge gained.Thanks to all team worked in this specialization
2809,"His course is fun, but the instructor or course admits need to put more video, contents and information to the course than just a few video, few topics per week like this. The Global Diplomacy course should provide clearer and deeper about diplomacy than to pose what is diplomacy or what the diplomats do in their very actions of daily routine."
2810,"Of you have some interest about that subject this video are for you. Since first video, that guns energy come into you and you really struggle for learn it and understand them."
2811,The best course ever!!! People should do this course before doing any other courses.
2812,"Great course for sports coaches, of teachers and anyone interested to pursue a career in sports."
2813,"Wonderful information! Although my experience is little, I feel accomplished after these nodules."
2814,Great course. Some of the tips discussed in this course have not only made me a better learner but have also helped me become much more efficient and effective at work!
2815,"Yeah, this course is REALLY different from other MOOCs. I wonder if I can learn anything from a course that contains such little content."
2816,His class helped me gain a perspective about what a healthy/nutrition diet is supposed to be like. Thank you for teaching this class May!
2817,"Letter than Netflix and HBO combined. Everybody should take this course, because it is so much fun."
2818,"good tips, but needs to be more tropical"
2819,Amazing course and the curriculum
2820,"The course was good, was helpful and the peers were respectful."
2821,I learned a lot of very good concepts in this well prepared lesson. Great teacher
2822,we need more dental courses
2823,"I love the style of the courses in this specialization. The exercises are useful and set you up for the assignment. I also really appreciate how the instructor guides you in the use of tools like bower, grunt, gulp and to, and that he takes the time to cover unit and end-to-end testing. Looking forward to the next course!"
2824,"Useful for people who want to know the very basis of HTML, CSS and Javascript."
2825,"Who ever need a Our to learn something new with Python , I recommend this."
2826,"Great course from the beginning to the end. It challenge you, motivate you and become a person with a different sense of (and tools for) innovation."
2827,Great course
2828,Thanks EPFL good course and has certainly broaden my awareness of the possibilities of using Scala.
2829,Thank you to provide me a completely new perspective regarding how to learn more efficiently. For sure it was a limestone for my life. I will never going to learn again at the same way and it includes how to enjoy more and more all those courses available at Coursera webster. Amazing! :)
2830,"Some topics that were covered in this course were not explained in details and, in addition, there was no explanation of the theoretical aspects of the course (for instance, formula transcribe )."
2831,Good and very interesting to know about managing people and labor laws
2832,Great course !!
2833,it would be 5 star rating if you will provide the deep detail or other practice exercise for Beautiful soup son and rest apioverall great course learn apt and i am using Beautiful Soup now very often
2834,Excellent course--learned allot and fun
2835,Excellent way of explaining the subject! Oats off to you ma'am!
2836,Very good/clear introduction to web design. Easy to follow.
2837,"Excellent. Love the video lengths, which were easily digestive."
2838,Thanks a lot for your work. It's a great course for data science in patron!
2839,I have no regrets at all in starting and ending this course! It is indeed a great motivation especially for me because I'm a semi-vegetarian and at the same time fond of organic food. I'll be always grateful to this learning experience! :)
2840,Give all key information for start up entrepreneur.
2841,I've loved the lecturer :) Joyful experience
2842,"Dear CourseraThis was my first Coursera course at all. The course is in general is interesting and it give a good theoretical approach and examples how to turn this theory in practice.The discussion possibility is also very useful. Learning from your classmates is great. The discussions are respectfully and if somebody has a different opinion or view this is seen as ""added value"" and is not judged negative.The only thing missing is the possibility to have live and direct conversation with the teachers. I did a training where we had the opportunity for one hour to ask questions in a chat and the teacher was answering them in a live weimar. That was really useful and would make it a ""five""***** star course.Overall, I would attend/take a Coursera training any time again. Great platform!"
2843,Good concepts. Teacher's excellent. Thanks. :)
2844,"Interesting, and well worth my time... I only give it four stars as I am kind stingy.. ;)"
2845,"It is not easy to teach a methodology, knowing that the students come from very different background and system domain. The instructor were able to teach the concepts with the right pace and to provide examples which were easy to follow. In my opinion, a key success criterion for the course is the chosen running example: a dwelling. Very student, independent from background and system domain, can relate to it and apply the methodology. Because of the dwelling example, students could review the work of other students and don't get confused by a system domain they don't understand. It is worthwhile to mention that the course material is based on ISO 15288 and ISO 29148. I can highly recommend the course as an introduction to Systems Engineering."
2846,very good course
2847,"Chris Prayer is a great speaker who clearly put a lot of care into how this material was presented. I have taken physical chemistry in my undergrad education and did well in it, but still learned a lot from the ~4 weeks of this course I actually did last time. By using base theoretical principles to motivate the thermodynamic principles, I got a different way to think about things I was familiar with and gave me a more intuition understanding for certain things."
2848,Challenging and very helpful course. I learned so much. Thank you!
2849,Excellent course. Very well drafted. The lectures are guest speakers were very good too. 6 weeks was appropriate time and they also allow flexibility. The pp on mobile and webster are brilliant; they both connected and very user friendly.
2850,By far the best MOOC on Machine Learning. Reaches the fundamental of the most important Machine Learning algorithms.
2851,"His is a really amazing experience in my career. Thank you, professor G. You give us excellent course and I really appreciate it."
2852,Very entertaining and information. Evidenced-based but taught in a dynamic and interesting way. Love it!
2853,Its really Excellent.
2854,The course was extremely information with a politic perspective on the sanctioning of various international courts as well as special courts addressing international law issues.
2855,Good course. Round it simple and easy to understand. Very practical tips and advice. Thanks.
2856,His course is going well until know.
2857,"Not about the actual effect of food on your health, it's just a cookbook."
2858,"In excellent and thoroughly enjoyable course. The reading are accessible and range in subject from philosophy to psychology, politics to literature. Or. Both's lectures are engaging and entertaining. He has excellent credentials and an excellent way of discussing his topics."
2859,"I was disappointed because the name is misleading. The course provides a good introduction & overview of the responsibilities of the CTO, but has very little specifically digital content. It deals with two-speed of in a single short lecture, so of course the treatment is superficial. It is easy to find more in-depth material freely available, on the McKinsey webster for example."
2860,It's wonderful!o(∩_∩)o
2861,i like this coarse
2862,"His course is an overview of SEO and doesn't go into a lot of detail of how SEO is actually implements on the site. That it does do is offer a snapshot of the industry as a job outlook, discuss Google's algorithm impact on SEO practitioner, offers interviews with current SEO analysis and experts, and describes how content affects SEO. I recommend taking the more practical courses in the specialization to get skill needed unless you're an absolute beginner and have no clue what SEO is."
2863,"Excellent! I love birds, always. Now I know them more."
2864,"His is an excellent introduction to of. Coming from a mathematical background, I felt that at times the course was a bit slow (e.g. Professor G would spend time performing steps on every element of a matrix, when a couple of examples would have sufficed), but jumping ahead in the video solved this problem easily. I was a bit more frustrated, however, with the few instances of, ""here's the formula, you don't need to know the deprivation."" I guess those who want to understand the path behind the technique can always look elsewhere, but Professor G obviously knows a great deal and is able to clearly and concisely explain difficult subjects, and so I was a bit disappointed to not be getting his instruction in the more difficult aspects.But, overall this course is great. In particular, I found the programming assignment to be excellent. They are a good level of difficulty, and manage to be quite interesting, as well. I will definitely hold onto the code I wrote for this course for reference as I move forward.Professor G, please create a more advanced course next!"
2865,It was excellent course. Thanks for the great job
2866,"Pretty good course, good overview of major concepts. Though it could be hard for absolute beginners, so some experience with HTML/CSS/of will help a lot."
2867,The optional video are not allotted enough time. Those concepts are difficult to grasp.
2868,"His is a fantastic course for anyone interested in Buddhist and gives an entirely different perspective on cantata and sonata. Or.Right has taken lot of pain and the course material (audit, video, text, web links) is excellent. The senators in the forum are very good and did a wonderful job in moderating the discussions."
2869,"A top-class course. Very well structures, and the lesson are very well explained. Good teacher and all the video are submitted in english. Of you want to learn Objective-C from zero and have some programming experience in OOP, take this without a doubt, you will enjoy it."
2870,"I took this course as I wanted to discover the Quantitative side of Business Modeling. And Thanks to Air Richard Waterman, I loved the concepts and understood them easily. I look forward to associate myself with penn in near future :)"
2871,Very well explained ! thank you !
2872,"Great course, especially when accompanied with book. The lecturer is great with nice sense of humour. Who the fee is a bit too high."
2873,To content for the first two weeks. Only links to webster.
2874,Great Course
2875,"Great teachers and most easiest way of learning music, thank you."
2876,i never seen some one passionate about calculus like Or. jim fowler i really learned clot from this course
2877,Thank you very much!
2878,Create course! Thank You
2879,It's awesome
2880,"Amazing Course!!! I was thinking about my work environment and the concepts are put forth in a simple, engaging manner and can be connected with the real world experiences and situations!! I'm lucky to be a part of such a valuable course!!"
2881,Enjoyed it very much
2882,"Great class and great teacher, a course every aid learner should take!!"
2883,"I Enjoyed the course, it was very enlightening."
2884,"A Fantastic course, bring forward a lot of new material to me personally. Having not studied any science since i was 16, and completed high school, i found this course extremely interesting and very much enjoyed the clear presentations. The content on big-feels was, for me, the highlight."
2885,Excellent teaching course including managers.
2886,"Thought provoking. Different cultural attitudes toward dogs a little settling - given number of bites and attacks, resources devoted to dogs rather than to humans, is a serious question."
2887,"Excellent course, very professionally produced. Great content delivered by engaging lectures. One of my favourite courses to date."
2888,His course was very helpful in showing us how to create characters that writer and reader both can really know.
2889,Excellent course. Really loved the programming assignment as they were short and simple. Mainly rousing on the concepts learned. Instead of having to write the entire program from scratch. Prof provided us with the temple which could be edited to practice and implement the concepts.
2890,"His is a course I would recommend, it covers the basis in data structures and have enabled me to do clot of stuff I couldn't have done or understand without it. Having already embarked on the next course this course is something I came back to again and again to re-watch the lectures since they are really helpful when you need to fresh up on stuff like ""how to handle a dictionary when faced with a all-file""."
2891,It's good summarizing for hospitality and healthcare marketing.From this course You can start to develop and gain the knowledge from other sources - they gives a of of links and articles.
2892,It's a good course with some interesting resources. Most of the practice resources use Clash and one of the assignment submission is inconsistent with the other submission formats. The content of the course itself is 4.5 stars. For me there is one element that I wish had an explanation or somewhere to ask about it. Instead I'll need to search the internet for an answer and hope what I find is correct!
2893,"It is really, really GREAT course!!!"
2894,good n valuable into....he there been more pectoral representations of effect of inflation mud have added value. Thank u.
2895,thanks
2896,"Full of useful information and easy to follow, the concepts are well explained."
2897,"Must like the previous two, this course is excellent! I recommend it without hesitation."
2898,"Great course with a lot of practical work, that makes you not only know subject, but also feel it by the tops of your fingers."
2899,Moved learning how to learn. It is going to be very helpful to me as I am a teacher. Thank you to the team of course.
2900,Very Good Course
2901,"His was great!I express my deepest gratitude to all those who made this course. Have, Jessica, you became a part of my family! Now my life is going to change, thank to you!"
2902,"His is a very good course to be introduced to Bootstrap. During the course, you create your own webster so you always use the things you just learned. Also, the course is very well structures."
2903,A great course introduces you to the International Saw Taking Body's. Love it!
2904,A complete exposition about data analysis and emerging jobs.
2905,"best course and very challenging. Of you are a beginner in coming and programming, you need to spend more time (double than normal)in this course"
2906,"The Course is not easy for someone who is new to programming languages, I myself with 2 years of programming knowledge with other languages I found it difficult to understand, the only thing I liked about this course was will training it was pretty easy, fun, and clear.Assignment was too hard and the descriptions are not that clear specially assignment 3"
2907,"Contents in first half weeks are very superficial, have low depth so that do not help me do some meaningful studies. But later ones are good for understanding the structure of data."
2908,It's very useful.
2909,It would be very helpful to provide all the presentations and laws as a slide deck for later reach on the GCP foundation
2910,Great course! It's a very introductory type course into typography. Very easy to understand and learn about typography. I enjoyed it.
2911,Learned some interesting new things. Felt the course was repetition after the third lecture though.
2912,A well explained with good support course! I recommend this to everyone interested in the field.Note: I would want to know how to move further with the pp and introduce it inside pp store and goose play store. His is omitted in the course. I am looking forward for this course updated if there will be any - and I think it will be improved!
2913,"Great course! It just has some small problems regarding script considering that most of them give some warning messages, due to the latest version of Unity which made some changes and deprecated some stuff.I've also felt sorry discovering that I can submit the tests and the projects only if I purchase the certificate."
2914,"His was a very exciting course giving an insight into data modeling challenges, working with database and visualization of data and showing smart ways of how Python can making our lives much easier by automatic processes around database. The course also covers the basic terminology of Object Orientated Programming making it a good liaison with what's been discussed in the previous lectures."
2915,"Great course. Simple explanations, discovered something new for me."
2916,"Thank you, Or Steve Joordens for a wonderful experience and the warmth of your teaching. I did learn things and am hooked on learning more. The course is well structures and doing the final assignment and reviewing peer assignment, was a great way to consolidate the learning. I hope you do ""mount"" another course or two in the future. I for one will be eager to enjoy."
2917,Excellent. Really useful and enjoyable. Highly recommended.
2918,"Really enjoyable course, with plenty of reading recommendations to keep you searching after you have finished it. The material was presented in manageable portions, with plenty of very interesting examples."
2919,Not happy with the quality of the material. Dropped the whole specialization halfway through this class.
2920,"His course is awesome! Pollen emphasized in the very important things of JavaScritp and it is helpful. You can learn a lot, I did and I am satisfied with this course, please post more courses of Pollen, she's the best teacher! I have to thank her A LOT!"
2921,"His course is a very well-made, solid introduction to Art & Activity for museum educators."
2922,Really like the mix of theory and practical application
2923,"Exceptionally good course material, Prof G's good job, great quires and well-guided assignment."
2924,Method of delivery was excellent!
2925,"Awesome course. The words of Andrew G that occur quite often here ""Of you don't understand - don't worry about it"" - will stick with me in the foreseeable future :D"
2926,"explanation is nice ,.it will be help full if practical implementation is shown using video"
2927,files is to weak!
2928,"A good course , programming assignment are also good , even the discussion forms are good. Tutorials are wonderful everything is explained very clearly and hints are given at each point overall good for computer science undergrad."
2929,His is a really great course. Thanks!
2930,The course that changes way of thinking. Thank you a lot for this.
2931,Great Course. I enjoyed being introduced to Business Ethics while taking this class.
2932,Vice amount of information easy to follow.
2933,"Thank you very much for the course. I have developed my algorithm on Atlas environment, so far. I have introduced to Python with the help of the course and have obtained much crucial information about machine learning."
2934,"Great introductory course on Astrobiology/Exobiology. It provides relevant background to understand what this is all about. I wish there would be more external printers, recommended reading, and a next stage."
2935,Very good course!
2936,Learn this course whenever you get time to improve yourself.His course will help you learn anything more efficiently than before.Thanks for Or. Valley and Or. Sejnowski.
2937,"EXCELENTE CURSO, ENRIQUECEDOR Y SOBRE TODO ADQUIRIR MAS CONOCIMIENTOS"
2938,"I enjoyed the course and it is very easy to take the information on board, you don't need a background in teaching to understand it.Delivered well in short chinks with short quit's on the way to help you digest and remember what you have learnt.It doesn't take a large commitment in terms of time to complete the course so click 'yes' and join up.His is the st mood I've done and look forward to doing more."
2939,good and very useful
2940,"His is a brilliant course. Starts from the basis of object tormented programming covering all the topics in intermediate details. Also, the final assignment helps you to add additional features and test your creativity!A must for beginners and a good course to review the fundamentals of OOAD."
2941,"Good course, especially good is coherent grunt and gulp which is very useful, also angular is covered very well for start. I learned a lot, even if i have some of angular knowledge."
2942,It seems the instructor Back U didn't prepare the course material.
2943,"The course structure is very well drafted. The pace and learning curve goes smoothly although starting third week, you would need external resources for help. You do get to learn a lot about R as a computational language with great hands-on experience."
2944,Great materials for learning Classification
2945,"His course content was brilliant. It is a good course for everyone, from beginner to the well seasoned photographer.I think Dark & Peter will find a way to enlighten you in this course."
2946,I found the material was good and the instructor was engaging. I appreciate that he tries to make learning hands on. Overall I found this a great introduction to Bootstrap. By only criticism is that at times I felt like I was only copying and passing code rather than really learning the material. I ended up copying and passing plenty of tags that are never really mentioned or explained.
2947,His course is a must for anyone regardless of their work discipline.It has been drafted well to suit audience of all ages.His course help us understand the common pitfalls in the way we try to learn and provides simple and effective guideline to minimize our learning.
2948,"The course is very difficult, but the quality is excellent. Due to the stringent trading of the program submission, I believe more help should offered for each assignment."
2949,Very good basic explanation. Expecting some more in-depth hard topics to be covered.
2950,"Very good content, clear and effective way to explain the core concepts."
2951,"Pretty good course, everything is explained very clearly, probably, the tasks are a bit easy, but I still appreciate the work of people who created this project. Thank you."
2952,Really helpful!
2953,I learned a great many Python knowledge from this course. It would be better if the quit and course material can be connected more closely.
2954,A great high level overview and introduction to machine learning. The topics broadly cover different machine learning algorithms and their approaches. The only downside is that the proprietary library they use to teach the concepts is incredibly expensive for an individual to license.
2955,The structure of this course is really good. The sides demonstrates everything clearly. The speed that the instructor talks is good too.
2956,Such an wonderful course! Highly recommended.
2957,Really good and practical course. It helps you reinforce the knowledge that you got from the three previous courses.
2958,"Good course, but assignment are too long, difficult and with no much help. Workload is erpassed"
2959,"Excellent, information and engaging course!"
2960,"Not what I was expecting, but for the ones who enjoy social network and want to learn, I recommend."
2961,I found this course useful as it corresponds to many approaches that I use or intend to use in my work on understanding the life cycle of technologies. The course instructor have carefully complied relevant examples to make it easy to understand many tricky concepts. Tutorials at the end of rd and th week are pretty useful.I would love to attend a course with more involvement of students through peer assignment etc.
2962,"A good overview of the how, what and why of processes. Will make you want to jump onto the next course"
2963,I am glad that I got an opportunity to learn a lot this course.
2964,Excellent information and presented very well.
2965,Great course
2966,Great course!
2967,Excellent and enlightening experience
2968,"Superb! Well articulated lecturer, practical real-life examples and you can but love this course."
2969,"Already having a computer science background, this module was right in my comfort zone. The instructor not only got down and dirty with the technical aspects of the algorithms, they preceded each practical coming session with multiple lectures with great explanations and well thought out visualizations."
2970,Great course
2971,Great course!!!!
2972,Wonderful course for all people who are interested in learning skill
2973,"It was very explanatory, just what you need to really learn."
2974,"Great learning experience, and how to maintain a healthy diet. Thank you."
2975,"Excellent course! It reaches very clearly about grammar and punctuation. It's easy to follow and understand. I recommend this to anyone who is not sure where to put that ',', ';' or '.'. Definitely worth it :)"
2976,Explicit and easy understandable.Thank you for the course!
2977,awesome course!!
2978,Great materials of very good value
2979,very interesting course
2980,"The material on graph analysis was of introductory level. A string of interesting ideas, with unclear explanations. The lesson on graph was basically a copy-paste introduction to it's abilities without actually teaching how to use it. The transcripts are full of mistakes. Someone not proficient in English or hard of hearing would be confused by them. It was somewhat difficult to understand the main lecturer. The best part was the explanation of Neo4j - and it was at an introductory level. A disappointment."
2981,"Thank interest course, get for yourself a new required information, a mild form of lessons .Sonya difficulty only in translation. Thank you."
2982,Robert Right does an excellent job presenting Buddhist ideas and putting them into context with modern psychology studies. I felt he offered a unique and scientific approach to the discourse and very much enjoyed his interviews and insight. The questions at the end of every lecture were very helpful to solidity new concepts. I look forward to digging deeper into supplemented materials.
2983,lOVE THE COURSE. GAINED A LOT of INSIGHT INTO of CULTIVATION of LEARNING
2984,Excellent Learning.
2985,Thank you for such interesting course
2986,"Great Course. Unlike other MOOC courses, it provides sufficient practices which helps me to understand the content a lot. Looking forward to take part B"
2987,fantastic introduction to of
2988,I learned a lot about comma.
2989,Really good course!
2990,"Good initial overview to the topic. Most code is actually provided to the student, preventing deeper learning via trial & error. However, it is a tradeoff of making the course accessible to a large number of students versus being too challenging and preventing newcomers from enjoying the subject. Or. Severance is excellent -- entertaining and clearly very knowledgable. For any novice programme looking to understand how Python can be used to access the web and scrape its data, this is the best place to start."
2991,Some quit answers were marked wrong when they were correct
2992,"Course was very interesting regarding the application of revenue management and specifically reviewing ""Revenue Management Terminology"" within the context of past and present tends in the Hotel Industry, but the course and it's additional reading material were slightly dated due to the fact that ""Late Rarity"" was reference many times and I understand those clauses non-extent on OTA contracts anymore due to their dubious reality. (It seems that most of the articles reference were from 2013, and a handful from 2014/2015)Also, unfortunately, Augustin Act was a little difficult to understand at times, and I speak French!"
2993,"A fascinating course, well delivered. I was especially interested in the issues related to the dynamic and development of Israel society."
2994,Course on photography really well done and useful.
2995,Good start for a novice
2996,"very clear, recommend!!"
2997,the best course I'have taken so far. paul Gloom is a truly great elector. Strongly recommend everyone.
2998,Very interesting and information.Well presented.A pleasure to learn.
2999,"The course has been released way too early, clearly it lacks most of its content and what does exist isn't working properly either."
3000,Requires payment to complete the course.
3001,"The course makes you learn:a) when you have to use Simple Last or Present Perfect;b) punctuation) how to write in clear way.There are problems with of platform: video often stops suddenly and sometimes it is difficult to understand where you are arrived in the course. Besides, sometimes you don't immediately understand what you have to do for passing to next step of the course.To sum up, the teacher is good. of staff could do better."
3002,"While the subject matter was extremely relevant, I didn't think this course was taught well. Such of the lecture and exercise focused on providing direction than actually teaching. I felt as though I was just copying and passing sample code. It times it was as though the professor was rushing to introduce new nodules rather than discussing how and why certain concepts should be used. In most cases, I could have learned the Tonic nodules just as well by reading the documentation and looking at sample code, which is often what this course felt like. I'd have much rather seen the concepts explained in more detail than rushing to add new nodules without any context.The quires are not challenging (the professor always puts the correct answer as the first choice) and the exercises just provide cut/paste code shippers without any reasoning or explanation. I would have preferred to have the exercises conducted by providing a high level goal and then a solution to check against rather than the ""put this code here"" approach that's used. The assignment trading is either far too obvious (whether a required module was injected or not) or completely arbitrary. Generally the assignment lacked france and complexity as well. I didn't feel like I really learned any of the concepts behind this material after going through the course."
3003,His is a wonderful course.
3004,"Thank you, Andrew G. It was very useful course that helped me to do my first approach in of and to understand in which direction should I develop my skill."
3005,"I have no background in this subject but am highly motivate to learn. Or. O was super information and provided links to additional resources on complicated/controversial material. I have learned a lot, and I am very thankful! Of you are interested in learning this subject, I strongly recommend this course"
3006,Very interesting. Useful tips.
3007,Awesome teacher and course !
3008,"I did not know anything about Ruby or Nails before this course. I found this course quite challenging because there was so many new concepts covered in very rapid fashion: Ruby, Nails, Aspect, all other tools. However, I think the coverage of the unit testing concepts was really useful. I had to go for goose quite many times to find out resolve issues I had with the tools and assignment. But in the end, I think this course was a good one, rating it 4 out of 5 starts."
3009,"His is a great course to learn more about teaching English, all the different approaches and technique. It's really worth and fun! Or. Have is an amazing professor!"
3010,It was an amazing course including a lot of information which is very useful in any company and any work.
3011,The course was worth the effort if only for the final stimulation. A real eye-opened!
3012,Vice and intuition course
3013,"I loved the process of branding from start to finish, including company/client. Although, I may not always be able to brand a company I make up, the process was very thorough and I believe will help me in future branding opportunities. In this sense, the class was invaluable! The instruction was very clear and interesting and the help of the class aid, Calvin, made this a great experience! I also loved seeing what others were coming up with and how they applied the principles of design learned in the other courses in this specialization."
3014,Unforgetable new thing.
3015,Exactly what I was looking for! Well done!
3016,"His course changed my life for the better, and that of my children too. Child centered teaching of possible, and this course makes it simple to reach as parent or teacher. The video are clear and to the point, so that the essence is there to get.Very teacher in the world should take it!"
3017,His course is not Must about Basis!! its worth taking it!!
3018,His course is very useful for beginners without any knowledge of Chinese language and culture.
3019,Moved this class!
3020,"Very good course for the beginners, who knows absolutely nothing about chinese"
3021,Amusing and interesting course!
3022,"His is a very helpful course that is taught in a fun, interesting way. I have been writing for business for many years and I still learned quite a bit from Or. McAndrew's course!"
3023,I found this course to be very helpful. I was very impressed by the instructor's responses to forum questions and the ease of submitting (and submitting) my assignment. Great experience.
3024,"Must got my certificate today, One of the best course out there to start from basic. little bit fast hence have to read lots of resources from other media like school.com. other then that its the best course to start with in web development."
3025,Excellent course! Terrific Teacher! this course and the previous one are awesome. I 'm recommending everyone I know to take both courses.
3026,The course contains a lot of a pretty simple things that can make writing much better. It helped me crystallized what I didn't understand about writing a research paper before.Thank you!
3027,A great course which can inspire you to bethink the old business model and give you a new meaning of the current business world.
3028,A great course :)
3029,Great course!!
3030,"Course is so clear to understand and content is fair enough to learn basis of finance.It won't make you finance our but you will be able to learn essentials.Lecturer David Standen has ability to transfer his knowledge to audience, so the lessons are easy to understand and comprehensible.More graphics, more animation or more visual items can be added to lessons to boost comprehension."
3031,"very good, excellent Course"
3032,excellent course and professor goes with a steady pace
3033,"Excellent course on the topic, I say. Good and detailed video and explanations, a lot of links to improve your knowledge when / where you want to read more on topic(s) , nice and challenging enough topics for practice and checking your understanding.Thank you very much, Jogesh K. Muppala for such interesting and deep course."
3034,The certificate is paid. It should offer a free version of some kind.
3035,Very nice and well organised. Enjoyed a lot. Thanks a lot. Very Helpful.
3036,Great class!
3037,Very useful technique for everyday life at the office and in the classroom!
3038,Great job...projects were too hard..need more instructions on coming
3039,"Although very interesting, this course seemed too short for me.Professor Woman is an expert in the filed, but he mostly reads thewords on the sides and shows little or no passion or interest in sharing hisideas and work whatsoever."
3040,Vice course with more important into
3041,Great survey course for main topics in machine learning without going too much into detail. The professors do a great job of keeping the topics relevant to modern-day uses of machine learning.
3042,Great course !!! You can lean everything from ..scratch.
3043,Good Start to everyone who want to start making music!
3044,Very Good!
3045,Thank you for all the work you've put into creating this course. It's been a pleasure to me to learn about basic sentence structures and vocabulary in Organ. Hope to see other lessons in future!
3046,pretty simple overview of data science tools
3047,In exquisite course with a great professor and team.
3048,new things learnt variation & inaccessibility specially
3049,very interesting
3050,His is interesting
3051,only put Spanish subtittle
3052,"Excellent opportunity to learn about CyberSecurity in a structures way!I recommend to that would like to understand about Information Security basis from physical access, continuity, responses cryptography and other topics.I`m already using the knowledge acquired in my day-by-day business."
3053,Thank you so much two distinguished professors.
3054,Very good course
3055,I like it very much. It's fun and easy.
3056,"Very good introductory course in Cava and OOP principles, well designed and structures, provides perfect programming assignment."
3057,Would and should be showed to the community
3058,"I felt like this course gave me a better understanding of why data is so important. I took this class as a way to gain better knowledge of marketing analysis in order to help my non-profit in which I volunteer be more successful and I hope that I can share the knowledge with them so that everyone can be successful. Sucks Unlimited is the organization that I volunteer for. They have a very ""old way of thinking"" approach when it comes to marketing and, while it takes a lot to listen to its volunteers, I think if I share what I learned with them, hopefully they will listen to the volunteers, specifically this volunteer on how to make things better. I would have given this course five stars, but I felt that in Week 3, some of the test questions were difficult because I had not taken MOOCs 1-3 and wasn't aware there was an order to these courses. Of I had known, I would have taken them in order. Thanks for the tips!"
3059,Awesome course on GIS applications using arcGIS. Totally recommended!
3060,Amazing Teacher. Thank u
3061,"It's a very helpful course for me to broaden my vision of study.There are so many useful and practical methods that can improve our learning efficiency.Of we absorb those ideas which are important to ourselves,and practice those technique,then transform them into our own skill or knowledge,most of us will succeed in the end.Thank u"
3062,Excellent course material from an excellent Instructor!
3063,"""Learning how to Learn"" is a wonderful course -- Barbara Rarely's teaching style makes it fun to learn how to learn. His course gives you confidence that you can learn new things!"
3064,"Excellent course, easy to follow and understand."
3065,"After so many years, I actually understood the core concepts of data structures. Thanks all three instructor. The amount of effort they are putting to make the things easy for the students is awesome."
3066,Awesome and easy course! A must for the beginners or for a quick revision. I completed this 4 weeks course in 4 days.. I know 4 days are clot more of a time but i hardly studies for 3 hours per day.. Great course.. looking forward for other courses as well in this specialization.
3067,Very easy but provides the necessary first steps to the of specialization
3068,The value of the information I learnt is Priceless.
3069,I found this course very very information
3070,A great course with nice learning curve and assignment for practicing the concepts
3071,"Professor is great, and the course gives a thorough introduction to patron data structures and isn't too hard to get. The only reason that I would give 4 stars is because the assignment and exercises. Each chapter you only get 1 or 2 codes to write, which can be easily adapted from the codes showed online. I'm hoping for variety of coming exercises to better understand the concepts. Since coming problems suitable for your stage is not easy to find out there on the internet. After completing this I can get a superficial understanding of the course materials, but right now it's still difficult for me to write a simple code using the knowledge covered in this lecture. You need to find your own source to practice."
3072,Great professors!
3073,amazing for the begins
3074,Thank you. It was very useful
3075,His is a great course for building or refreshing fundamental concepts in material engineering.
3076,The Importance of Listening is a great course providing hands-on tools on how to track the social impact. Very useful tools.
3077,Fantastic course! Everything you've ever wanted to know about the computer is taught here! Cannot wait to start the second part!!!
3078,Another great class. Really gets you thinking. I doubt I will learn anything from this course. Good stuff.
3079,"The course is too easy if you know any programming language, but I think that it is very helpful for derbies in programming."
3080,Really cool
3081,"A 'must' for everyone! Entrepreneurship is something unique, is not for everyone but can be reached with some effort. A course that can be applied to all areas. Vice experience."
3082,from start with the arguing it´s very good
3083,Very fun-to-learn tutorials and reviews.
3084,"Very software engineer, not necessarily in managerial role, should take this course. Collecting user requirement is the first step of a software development project. With the knowledge given in this course, developer can avoid lot of mistakes which they would do otherwise. I enjoyed this course a lot."
3085,Excellent instructor; lessons are well structures.
3086,"Compared to other courses I have completed on Coursera, this is one of the most confusing ones so far"
3087,Thanks a lot! That was great!
3088,great course
3089,Awesome course taught by a great professor! Thoroughly enjoyed it.
3090,Thank you. I am indeed happier. I am very grateful to professor A. You've changed my life! I needed just this course.
3091,good times!
3092,Fantastic Course.
3093,That was really exciting :) And the assignment were interesting and giving a deeper understanding of the material
3094,"The course provides a number of very useful tips for researches, especially those whose first language is not English. There are a number of useful guides for new researches to learn how to structure, phrase, and approach academic writing. However, there are also a few shortcomings of the course. Some of the material is overlay subjective (giving rules for academic writing that are not necessarily applicable). Any of the assessment questions ask about issues which are either overlay specific or simply incorrect (this is a very small percentage, but it is noticeable). The pace of the video is also slow and oddly punctured to the point that it can be difficult to follow at times. Finally, the course relief too heavily on academic writing for the hard sciences, rather than taking a broader approach, so some students may wish to keep this in mind when watching, as some advice may not be applicable to their own discipline.Overall, a recommended course for ESL academic, but could do with some improvement."
3095,great stuff!!!
3096,Great actionable content.
3097,"Great overview and engaging introduction to repression, fluttering, classification, and deep machine learning with hands-on ability to see some of these practices in action programming exercises in Python. Good introduction to the more in-depth materials which will be covered in other courses in the specialization."
3098,"I like this course a lot because it solidified my understanding of repression. I have often read about repression when reading scientific articles however, i never took the time to really investigate the mechanics on how it is done. Thanks to this course i can now appreciate better the journals that i read. Furthermore, the course project for this course was quite interesting, not too hard, and was bit challenging. There was plenty of time to finish the project and some extra time to make it even better than a simple submission that meets the basic requirements of the course. Thanks to the my classmates and the nice people in Coursera and R, i had a great time learning during this course."
3099,Great introduction to how analysis can be applied to marketing and other business solutions.
3100,"His is the best course I have taken on Coursera so far. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in marketing, branding or management.Thank you for this awesome course!"
3101,Basic course helps in understanding what HTML is all about. Thanks to instructor for sharing this course.
3102,"Rough quires but its well said ""you need to heat and beat the iron to re-shape"". its totally worth your effort."
3103,Awesome course
3104,Very inspiring and information course on evolutionary psychology and Buddhist. It really improved my vision. I'm grateful for all who made it possible for this course to be online.
3105,Great and representative course.
3106,"Very simple, very slow. For someone with programming experience it is a drug, for someone new to programming (I am thinking my son) not very captivating."
3107,"In alright starting course, but the exercises could be a little more in depth"
3108,A very helpful course for people looking for a place to start learning expel.
3109,"I'll strongly recommend this course for those who are interested to introduce themselves to the Social Enterprise world from scratch. Very well explained, easy to understand, logic order for the content, true stories as an examples, inspiration. 100% recommended!"
3110,"I enjoyed every aspect of this course except Timaeus. Not being mathematically inclined I felt all of the discussion of triangles and what this was supposed to have shown was a waste of time. Letter to tell us what he is trying to say, show a few examples, and move on."
3111,"His course is great! There is a lot of information available, a wide range of topics are covered, some complex subjects are explained quite well and especially the Chinese professor makes it easy to understand them.Still, there is room for improvement. Considering this is a 4-week course and the coverage of the material, sometimes it feels too squeezed and cramped together. His could be improved by providing access to more references to other materials to complement the studies. A bibliography for instance would be much welcome.Also there are some annoying types in the sides in the formula and its deviations that can cost you some precious time to figure out, especially during the Atlas assignment.These are the only reasons I don't give this course 5 stars, but it's definitely worthwhile. You will not regret it!"
3112,His course is a must for all professional in engineering and related background. The technique learned in this course can be very useful in many aspects of learning.
3113,Thanks to Duke university for offering these professional courses free

3119,"Great course! Easy to learn as about 2,5 hours per week. I had some fun while studying this course."
3120,"I have been doing this course since my last smelter, this is the best online course i have ever taken! His course gave me all the basic understanding and motivation needed to move forward towards learning more about machine learning and of concepts. Thumbs up to Professor Andrew G. Thanks lot! :D"
3121,Great course! I learned a lot from it! Thanks!!!
3122,"His is such a well presented course. The relevance of contents presented are clearly outlined in every module. The attention to detail and passion by all involved in this course, is inspiring. His is a wonderful field of study and the research conducted is simply awesome. Thank you so much."
3123,"The slide set is too brief, was expecting more details with examples & visual"
3124,an awesome way of teaching..
3125,It seems very easy for beginners and it means perfect. Great class and professor :)

3130,Simply great !
3131,Very thorough and engaging. I would take other courses offered by this University and this Instructor. Thank you.
3132,"Professional, comprehensive, worth to learn"
3133,"His is a challenging course because there is a marked gap between the video lectures and the weekly assignment. His course will be far more demanding of your time and willingness to fail that the Data Scientist's Toolbox. Of you have the time and residence to search out support materials and frequently refuse the Discussion threads, you will be able to find what you need. By peers with programming experience confirmed that there is too wide a gap between the content delivered in the video lectures and the demands of the coming assignment. Of you decide to take this course, be sure to do the will exercises so you get a feel of how the R functions work. When you grade your peers' work, you might notice that more than a few decided to plagiarize code from others.The video need to be done. Effective instructor know that students learn by seeing examples, not by listening to broad descriptions of what a function can do."
3134,"Great！ Relatively intense but really beginner-friendly! You can make it in 2-3 days!Took forward to the next course in this series.Thanks! Grew, Robert,Susan and Wen!"
3135,"It's more focus on the functional programming rather Scala programming language itself, but nevertheless it's fascinate to switch the midst from one to another and think about the a totally different perspective."
3136,Quite a good course and is very easy to understand.
3137,"The course was information, condensed to be easily understood, and was well done. I left the course eager to learn how to cook!I think the course could have demanded / pushed the students a little more to think about this deeper.I am excited to try out the recipe!"
3138,Great course about machine learning. Thanks for of and Stanford University.
3139,Really useful for whatever discipline you're trying to learn in. A great introduction to Coursera for me.
3140,The first lesson was very good i will today and maybe tomorrow see the next lesson and i hope that it is also good
3141,"Good course, great tool."
3142,"Vice class, give a brief introduction to all the methods use in of without going deep. Of you just want to get an idea of what of Mechanics are and how to implement them this course is for you. Of you are want more technical details about of this class is not for you."
3143,Outstanding ways to broaden knowledge!
3144,"Very thorough, very nice, quite entertaining and interesting.Is someone who has a lot of trouble remembering names I found the quires quite hard (I was not pursuing the certificate so I didn't care if I failed) but I understand that since the class and the goals are subjective while the evaluation has to be objective it matters that those questions can be ambiguous.All in all, I feel like I did learn to look at photographs differently, and to look at the world through photographs. I'll definitely recommend it to my friends!"
3145,His course is just fantastic. It is well paced and very information. There is also room for all levels of proficient. It has changed the way I see visual arts and branding. I am now more aware of the history and the motivation of this discipline. I would recommend this course to anybody who is interested in learning how to enter or continue in this field!
3146,Excellent!!! His course provides right framework to handle any negotiation...
3147,Awesome course.
3148,Excellent thoughts and concepts presented.
3149,Very good course in general
3150,His is the perfect into to machine learning course. It covers several important algorithms and it reaches you how to implement them on octavo/matas. Prof Andrew G is superb and the quality of instruction is fantastic.
3151,"His was a great course. I was a History major in college, but the information that I learned in this course was a complete surprise to me."
3152,"Excellent course which uses concepts and insight from a broad variety of sciences to teach students how to learn. Probably the best course I ever took on Coursera and something people in all walks of education - be it at school, university or later in life - would greatly benefit from taking."
3153,"Very well put together, explaining in a simple and direct manner many concepts that were forgotten to me."
3154,"In overview of concepts and models of how network form. There are applicable with basic concepts from probability theory, statistics, and some light calculus astonishing well."
3155,His course gave me some nice encouragement tips to get started on a new wealthier path!
3156,Love this course! the professor is funny - especially when he uses his own photographs in certain examples and calls them patent/copyright free one entire specialization so far has been a wonderful learning experience.
3157,Such a great fun and benefit to learn ...
3158,The best course I have taken here so far! The teacher really knows how to promote curiosity and enhance knowledge to the students.
3159,"Is we advance, it gets better and better. Thumbs up!!!"
3160,Thanks to this part I was able to test my knowledge and create something useful which I can use at work or in my private life.
3161,In fantastic course with plenty of information information that is current.
3162,Love this class! It makes learning to code not only accessible but enjoyable.
3163,"Very worthwhile. Great overview of permanent behavior, environmental, physiological and biological factors influencing chicken behavior and welfare. Good video with supplementary materials that added value to the course. Thank you for making this available through MOOC."
3164,Going through this whole Specialization has been a great journey. Thanks to this final project we were able to use everything we learned.
3165,Awesome course
3166,"The professor explains well, however it's a introductory course."
3167,"i really enjoyed this course it became one of my favorites it is quick it is conscious has a lot of knowledge, it is perfect"
3168,"I really enjoyed this course. He prepared though that some of the assignment take substantial time to prepare, intervening others. On't just assume that each 'week' in the course plan will take you a week to complete. It would be useful to have a bit of warning up front in the course overview about which weeks have assignment that require more time."
3169,very productive
3170,Good start course. Good professor. Thank's all!
3171,Fundamental but good course for photography.
3172,It is helpful for people who speak English as a foreign language. Thanks.
3173,His course has been my favorite of the Interaction Design Specialization so far. The concepts shared are truly fascinating!
3174,It's a great way to start learning R Programming!
3175,thank you for the amazing course!
3176,"Insightful travel throughout Beethoven's music writing style, and more generally on musical structure of piano sonata before and after Beethoven's contribution."
3177,Good but with some errors in assignment and not real support via the forum - some question has not been answered
3178,"Not useful by itself, but grudging necessary to get you ready for subsequent courses in the specialization."
3179,"Excellent and very practical course. Thank you, An One."
3180,Great
3181,"The lectures and assignment dealing with Tonic were useful and information, but that's only the first half of the course. The Android/in portion felt extremely rushed. For all of the haste of setting up my Android environment, I get one week of lectures/exercises out of it and that only covers rudimentary functionality."
3182,"The Course is good which gives an overview and good introduction to the field to Algorthmic trading. However the course exercises are very easy, but on the otherwise it gives opportunity to every learner to complete the course"
3183,"His course gave a comprehensive overview of what is going on, and where the rules come from, in SEO. It also makes clear, however, that one should take this course once a year since so many aspects are changing permanently. I learned a lot, and I will sure take it again in a year or so."
3184,Thank you for the course!
3185,"The course was really great. It gave powerful insight and tools for aspirin public policy practitioner like me, and for broader social scientists as a whole."
3186,Very basic but important knowledge.
3187,Excellent introduction to basic concepts of machine learning. I will continue to follow the other courses in the specialization.
3188,"Some good content. However, text has numerous spelling mistakes and there is no involvement by academic staff. For can one see one's answers to quires once done., nor standard answers provided. Is with so many Coursera MOOC's, little involvement by fellow students in discussion for. To certificate on completion, which is a pity because the cost of a purchased one is somewhat prohibitive for third world students with our exchange rates."
3189,Great course！ I have learn a lot. Thank you!
3190,Valuable information for a basis course. Learned several tools I'm taking into my work as an unofficial project manager.
3191,fantastic!!!!!!!! inspiring!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3192,Relevant and interesting choice of assignment.
3193,Great
3194,"Have May sir has explained this course with such simplicity that one can understand the course with ease. Thank you sir. The video, and the related articles are so distinct that it helps us understandvery well. I personally enjoyed doing this course and am looking forward to do more courses."
3195,"Really interesting course, and well taught."
3196,The courses introduces very well the Unity Same Engine. I wish i could find it earlier. Thanks
3197,"It's the best course to start machine learning ,Gives wonderful foundation to build on .Thank You Or.Andrew for this great course."
3198,Congratulations. West course. Thank you all!
3199,Good course for overview
3200,Great introduction of machine learning
3201,"Vice course! The instruction is clear and fun. I enjoy the ""interaction"" with Or. Charles Severance during the lecture. And I really like the bonus video, like interview with the creator of patron every week~"
3202,"Very useful, interesting, and helpful. It really helped me understand how come I memories some stuff easier than others. I've learned so much on how to learn and I've been applying it for other courses. Highly recommended."
3203,The course was excellent. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this field.
3204,very useful course. But of the whole specialization loved it the most !
3205,"I can only give this two stars at most.The lectures are just like reading the PPT without any heuristic teaching approaches.The assignment make me desperate, always show very poor feedback message -- ""Wrong answer"", even the cases failed because of performance issue.The started files given from the assignment are inconsistent with the of description. It's so confusing.Wouldn't get any help from forms."
3206,"I like the course, but I'd like to have deeper information about HTML5 and more exercises for learning and practicing. Also, there's few into about costing and managing your webster. Hope i'll find it in sooner courses of this university."
3207,"Some really good printers. I would have liked to see more for the experienced person, this was quite focused on new college grass."
3208,"His was a pretty great course. With a focus on understanding and coming repression algorithms, I was engaged throughout the course. I'm a programme with a physics B.C trying to make a shift away from product development and in to analytical problem solving. I found the lectures useful, the wiki useful when I didn't have time to watch the lectures, and the quires and assignment very practical."
3209,"I really enjoyed this course as it was an interesting blend of lectures, reading with practice quires and case studies. It gave me an overall understanding of the global health issues and I will refer to it whenever I need a revision."
3210,Incredible!!! His course really improve my essay writing!
3211,Love the courses as always
3212,Perfect!
3213,Good introduction of of
3214,Really great and useful stuff
3215,Great! Lots of helpful information.
3216,Topics were of but the focus on R and no other tools is frustration
3217,A must-learn course to survive in the age of artificial intelligence!
3218,Statistical inference is one of the most useful things in data analysis.It was very interesting and useful course!!! Any thanks to authors!
3219,"Amazing course, amazing lectures. It was very fascinating ."
3220,The instructor goes in depth and he has a way of explaining the material very clearly.
3221,Very good and complete description of how life evolved on earth and the conditions associated with specialization and dispersion.
3222,Learned a lot of new things in this course. Very inspiring.
3223,"Fantastic course. Great pace, very explanatory"
3224,"Actually, this course is a great one to take. Professors have explained these concepts and main ideas very clearly, therefore students can understand it very easily, even if they do not have previous knowledge about game theory. I want to say “thank you” to all the three professors for making such a concise and intelligible course.However, I would like to give some suggestions about this course. There is an obvious gap between the quires and grade assignment. Sometimes the quit is very easy and it just requires you to have a basic understanding of the concept, while the assignment is even more difficult than the examples included in the video. I think this course would be better if the staff can improve the difficulty gap between quires and assignment. And for people who want to knoll this course, an exercise book with detailed solution would be helpful for you to learn it better.Is for the content of this course, there are lots of formula from Week 5 to the end, which are a little difficult to understand. I fully understand this because path is always abstract, and formulation is an essential part of it. I think this problem can be solved by providing more degraded quires for students to practice. They can have a better comprehension of the content through practicing.Anyway, this course is worth taking. Through learning it you will gain not only the knowledge about game theory, but also a new way to understand relationships around you. Happy learning!"
3225,very basic.
3226,outstanding into
3227,I really enjoyed this course! Vice structure and excellent lessons by Professor Hogarth.
3228,Very interesting topic and good way of teaching
3229,Full of great information!
3230,Great material and great teachers who keep you engaged throughout the session.
3231,really helpful
3232,I like the course it is very information and all those skill are simple and easy and these things can be able to cope up by those who are in need of help!
3233,"Thank You Coursera for showing me the way.His course is helping me to enhance my interest..........Oats off to the professor , peers and all those who make this happen."
3234,The overall course was excellency managed. The lectures were really superb. Prof. Him was explaining every concept with fantastic details. His way of teaching is exemplary. The most important thing was quires. Quizzes contained questions which were not so easy and at the same time not so difficult. I enjoyed the course . More and more such courses will be welcome by students and teachers of Mathematics.
3235,"A really great course combined with a very good teacher makes for a great learning experience. A very beautifully designed course which takes you from the basis to quite advanced levels. Anyone looking to start learning web development, look no further!"
3236,Fantastic Course!
3237,It's awesome! After this course I can claw lots of data on the internet
3238,"Good for the beginner who knows nothing about programming and just have litter knowledge about basic components of computer. His course is not recommended for of professional, may be other courses in this specialization may be effective for them."
3239,"Experienced in R, I finished this course in about 5 hours. It is well organised course and charities the france clearly."
3240,In incredible way of increase your study abilities
3241,it's easy for me to learn patron with database
3242,"It's mostly very basic stuff, but even then it introduced me to concepts I wasn't aware of."
3243,Amazing course! the teacher is magnificent. Everything is explained so detailed that I got a good grade :) thank you and I hope you do more of these moods
3244,Cry Material and the second professor was
3245,I love the assignment. It really helps me understand and remember how to use all the components and functions.
3246,Not Very relevant and detailed as the previous course. The content is not as clear and simple as previous course
3247,"His course is very helpful, and I have learned something new . Thank you."
3248,It's more a review than an actual class.
3249,really good
3250,A must-take for every professional in the sustainability field.
3251,Good overview of what makes an of device different from a normal household device
3252,I was expecting this course to be just about dogs. It was still interesting. Thank you.
3253,His is a great course: very insightful and delve deeply into different levels of who is included in the Talent Pipeline! A great expanded view. The only thing I would change is the filling of YouTube video (
3254,I like this class. It provide a lot of detail into. And the teacher is nice and patience.
3255,"His course contains many very practical ideas and methods to leadership, tearworn and negotiation."
3256,"Really great. Is a path major, some of the material early on is too slow but the pace is certainly good later on after neutral network. Of you feel not challenged enough, you can always think about why something is true while Andrew describes them. And if you have enough experience of linear algebra, Andrew makes reference to many aspects of it in the course for you to think over. There may be some repetition between different sections, but that helps with drilling the important facts into you. Also, the whole course as taught at Stanford is available online with the all the mathematics put back in and so you can always go visit there if you wish."
3257,"His is a great course, very thorough and comprehensive introduction to Biological Diversity."
3258,His course is so useful!!!
3259,A good introduction to the Healthcare Marketplace though the pace of the class makes hard to understand all the economical concepts.
3260,Introduction to Spreadsheets and Models provides very useful tools in learning how to think with numbers. I highly recommend this course.
3261,"A very good and educational course, but you have to know your basic theory before you get started."
3262,Amazing course with a lot of secrets about social computing from USA to other countries :)
3263,Such a great course..
3264,"In amazing course. I wasn't expecting much when I enrolled a few weeks ago but the more I studied and watched the lessons I was surprised with so many great tips and resources to understand and become a better learner. I found it funny that there were some technique that I already use but have never thought on them. I recommend this course to anyone, either in high school or college, or even as preparation for other courses in Coursera. Why don't they teach this in elementary schools?"
3265,I really enjoyed learning the course. It was useful for a first time learner such as myself to learn with ease
3266,I really enjoyed the content of this course. It has been very helpful in my development as a musical artist.
3267,Good and very useful course!
3268,"It is a good introductory course, but it could be optional for people with some experience in the field, as it is very basic."
3269,I enjoyed it very much. I found it very interesting.
3270,"Very good course. I like the course assignment.For one who have not taken a biology course before, it is tough, though broad reading over the years about health, and having worked in a biotechnology companies helped."
3271,Highly recommended. Perfect Course.
3272,Thank you so much for providing an intermediate level of patron backs in one course. It really facilitate and makes coming much more efficient and faster.
3273,"Thank you very much for this beautiful course. To many concepts, clearly explained and with great passion. West wishes from Montevideo, Uruguay."
3274,Give stars for that course and special thanks to mr. Chaikin for his skill to tell complex things with simple words.
3275,"Great course. From my experience in Coursera, it is perfect presentation.Only one thing. Instead of inserting block of code, during exercise, better when instructor is tying the code. To, it comes to better realize for a student, feeling where he is, at the point."
3276,"The course is very well prepared and structures, the information provided is clear and concise, Prof. McPhee's teaching style is very adequate to the MOOC approach. Highly recommended!"
3277,too much theory and not nearly enough practical models that I can use in my life or work. Disappointed so much of the class was spent on describing many different models instead of rousing on ones that can be applied readily.
3278,It was very intuition course with lots of example and explanation.
3279,Such a interesting course with pray
3280,"In general, it's very good!1) The interview and other stuff in the bonus video should renamed as optional or other names. It's misleading people to think bonus as materials related for the class.2) Is the name is programming for everybody, will be better if some of the explanations or sides can be linked with daily life cases for people to understand the concept easily."
3281,Excellent. Very Intuitive.
3282,Deal course to get you started for a data science specialisation. Informs about and helps you install all the required software.
3283,The best thing in this course is (next to great new ideas that I learned about) is the way mr Right talks. A nice calm voice and amusing way of arguing. I loved it.
3284,"Its great course. I am enjoying it. Right now I am in week 2, so can tell more than this. But, I really like the way this class is going on . Thanks for this course!"
3285,His course give me numerous knowledge about Agile and the related knowledge. Thanks for creating this course.
3286,the best
3287,Very interesting and well build up .Some of the C & C++ IDE software didn't properly work well on my lawton and are hard to get them going....THX Prof An Harris
3288,Great course! I really liked the online experience and the instructor did a very good job of explaining the material. I'd recommend this course to anyone who is interested in coming.
3289,Very interesting discussion about the writing of the Hebrew Bible. Particularly enjoyed the interviews with experts in the field.
3290,"Very nice course, lots of information, well structures. Cries to take you out of the ""common"" and visualized distinct aspects of your photo, new angles, perspective!"
3291,this is a very information course...
3292,I will finish this course.
3293,A really interesting course that crystallized a lot of things I already instinctively knew and gave me a set of new tools to make my learning journey more efficient.
3294,"Excellent course, excellent teaching, excellent professor. Thanks."
3295,"It was a great experience. even when things came up and I got behind, there was never the feeling of being left behind or abandoned. They offered alternative solutions to get you right back on track"
3296,I think with more listen exercises this course will be better and the length of the video too short.
3297,Amazing. May better than my community college of courses.
3298,Instructor are very knowledgeable and people working in the industry have given shippers of their advice in this module. His course is really helpful if you want to start from scratch or if you are looking for a refreshed of your skill. I highly recommend it.
3299,Good introduction
3300,His course gives some great insight as to why and how we act emotional. It walks through the physical and cultural aspects of emotions in ways that really tell why we do and interpret things certain ways.
3301,Insightful on the various concepts of advertising
3302,Thoughtfully designed course!!!!
3303,"Thank you all professors of John Hopkins, for excellent explanations and relevant examples to help improve learning."
3304,"Good video but structural into and help. Unfortunately , for me it wasn´t very exciting or motivation and perhaps that is because of my own interests."
3305,Very interesting course. Already started to look for another one from Edinburgh University. Great job!
3306,"Very, very useful course. I learn a lot from this, not only how to study better, but also gain my confidence to learn anything late.Highly recommend!"
3307,"The free version of the course is far more restricted than other courses I've taken, the content wasn't brilliant, and it wasn't really more advanced than other tutorials with far better presented which can be found online for free"
3308,Versa is great! she seems very friendly and kind but some contents are a little bit worried and difficult.
3309,"have learn too much interesting concepts and perspective regarding interpreting the results of an statistical analysis, also knowing how to chose the perfect statistics tool for a given data set>>>>really enjoyed to have such course with that excellent explanationNote:can you guns make a better presentation image to visualized hard concepts."
3310,"Very interesting, unusual and emotional course."
3311,New look on the interesting subject. I am amazed.
3312,His course is helpful
3313,very helpful for my master degree.thank you so much!
3314,Very good into to Social.
3315,Excellent practical content . addresses the challenges leader face on daily basis.
3316,"His course was highly enjoyable. I would like to thank Or. Miller for a great course presentation. Professor Miller presents the material on Financial Markets from a very interesting historical perspective that gives a human personality to the world of finance. It is open enough for someone that has no background in finance but also gives treatment to some mathematical models that students who know the basis may also benefit from. It certainly taught me a lot about how financial markets work and the rational behind how the industry has developed the way it has along with the regulation around it. I would suggest adding another lecture video on crowdfunding, JOBS Act, fitch etc. in the final week which will talk about some of the developments in the world of finance which are very relevant today. It will also tie in nicely with the concept of 'demoralization of finance' how we all can play a role in the finance industry. Highly recommended and well done!Regards, Zeeshan Shaikh"
3317,Excellent! A great overview of the design fundamentals. A great fit for complete beginners.
3318,"The enter is really good, he is great at explaining what he means and gives you a few great methods for writing. The peers were also great."
3319,"The course is quite amazing. Programming exercises are interesting but quit are a little boring. of, I nearly fall asleep in the last several classes but it doesn't mean the classes are not exciting!"
3320,this course cover every thing in Software Security and make my knowledge different .
3321,"Absolutely amazing course, thanks so much!"
3322,I am really enjoying learning Python. Great course. Or. Chuck is wonderful.
3323,Very nice course
3324,great course
3325,Really covers the basis
3326,"The content was VERY scarce, and it was obviously prepared in a hurry. His course just touches very superficially the subject to be studied. Not meeting minimum quality standards."
3327,Provided a firm foundation of what to expect and how it will be accomplished.
3328,"His course gave me a very practical and broad knowledge of the genesis of the State of Israel, its challenges and political processes from unionism as a movement to reality."
3329,Highly useful course even if you don't have a huge statistical background. Very good mix of theory and practice / examples.
3330,Great introduction to calculus. Very clear explanations and good pace. Thoroughly enjoyable! Thank you!
3331,Very interesting. Concentrated on the learning of fundamentals. A must-do for anyone coming from a non-business background. Very good review for business major.
3332,Great course !
3333,"Awesome course, great teacher. very useful material, quires, assignment, review questions and intuitions throughout the course"
3334,"I enjoyed doing this course. I studied machine learning as a subject in my Masters, but this course offered many applications as examples. The programming assignment were also very practical."
3335,Great into
3336,"It has been an excellent source of learning. I am taking the time to read the books that are recommended with the course thus the learning is richer. The formats used of video, supplemented reading, quit etc are useful and spot on. Thanks"
3337,thanks for this course. very interesting and easy to understand
3338,Great into to R clotting
3339,I found this course useful and appropriate in the material offered and the possessed questions as an introduction and an update in cancer biology for CPD purposes. It is rather disappointing that the final grade achieved is not printed on the certificate. For A$65 to join the course and not have the full information such as the hours involved and the final grade achieved makes it very disappointing not to reflect the effort I put in as well as tricky to include this course as part of a CPD program.
3340,His was a great course - well planned out and really information. Thanks!
3341,Great course. Thank you!
3342,Round it a had too basic (I'm a professional C++/Cava programme). But an excellent introduction to patron. I must particularly mention the fluidity of the course embraces the spirit of the Python language.
3343,"I thoroughly enjoyed the video, the special book accompanying the lectures and the R exercises. By particular fads are the book and the R assignment. Great job!"
3344,His was an excellent course. It was interesting and information.The professor was a great teacher.
3345,Fantastic! Well explained and very instructing
3346,"not on topic, not honest, and dramatic.also the auto email continue after unsubscribing from the course."
3347,have not even finish and already very satisfied.
3348,"Good course for people involved in the design of public policies. His course is perfect to politics and CEOs, people with the money to invest or the ability to organic big group of people and educate them to invest."
3349,Very interesting topics.
3350,It is a great course.Thank you
3351,Hard topics but easy explained or illustrated.
3352,"Really good, teach me the basic skill of web development."
3353,Very well explained and practical introduction to machine learning. I enjoyed it a lot! Thank you!
3354,"I can't even make pre-course survey, which couldn't have wrong answers"
3355,Lectures are very concise. His course can help you grasp the most important core concepts and key working mechanism of human physiology. But I don't know why it do not have the immune system.
3356,Outstanding! Absolutely recommendable!
3357,good course!
3358,"The Capstone Project makes you summarize what you have learnt so far and take it to the next level, natural language processing . Besides, the ability to create a working pp is a reward by itself.It is challenging and interesting at the same time."
3359,maybe could be more in depth. I really appreciated how passionate Or Chuck is and how much he cares about his students even in online lectures. Thank you!!
3360,"Comprehensive, enough amount of quires and suitable assignment to ensure your understanding and give you enough practice. Nicely planned. I have really benefited from it."
3361,The material was very interesting but the lectures were often very difficult to understand.
3362,"I liked very much this course. I had forgot many of these grammatical rules, so it was really good for me. Is in any other language, English is not easy, you have to practice daily, even that be just a little bit."
3363,very good - step by step and clear.
3364,His is a very comprehensive course! I love it!
3365,"short, but useful course :)"
3366,I use this course as a good resource it has been very helpful for me the explanation of Or Crosart are incredibly good.
3367,"The beginning is a bit theoretical, only the end brings some practical examples up. Sides are a bit old fashioned and presented are a bit rigid"
3368,"Excellent course for those who are new to of. Since the course is based on writing basic algorithms (rather than making use of the ready made libraries), it gives a solid understanding of the underlying principles of of."
3369,Extremely interest course. Learned a lot. Really puts everything into perspective. Professor tells history like a story.
3370,"I thought this course would teach art appreciation,but seems feared towards Teachers."
3371,Simple and practical!
3372,"Thank you for the big help, yes i am not purely speak English but because of this, it will help me to find a better job and answer any interview on a good way."
3373,His is a fantastic way for individuals to get a leg up if they want a competitive edge in an ever-changing scientific environment. It is important to be able to use certain programs and code to some degree in order to be competitive using today's technology.
3374,homework could be more complicated
3375,Would have more exercises for the ones who still is saving up to pay for it.
3376,Its a great course.....
3377,His course was a fun one that encouraged experimentation and making a lot of images. I would say the assignment could have been more challenging though.
3378,Outstanding Course for a newby. All about programming. Lectures and problems are clear and relate directly to the subject not related topics like statistics and other discipline which add nothing to the Python and Python programming focus. Or. Severance has built a great specialization here. Problems can be challenging but double within the time frame represented by the course description (give or take a couple hours on some of the more challenging ones. I've learned clot! Thanks
3379,"The course provides a lot of hands on experience on controlling root, both theoretical and practically."
3380,I think that it is a great course
3381,great course indeed.
3382,"I have never had calculus explained to me so well before attending this course, Thank you!"
3383,a decent introduction into the world of patron dataframes via the hands library
3384,very information.
3385,"The course explains the basic concepts of programming in a way that is easy to understand, and with a bit of humour too. I really enjoyed it and can recommend this course for all who are beginners into programming."
3386,"Helpful introduction to conflict resolution. I appreciated having the various categories and causes mapped out. It makes it easier to talk about conflict once you've internalized the terms of the categories: interpersonal/intergroup/intercultural, values/economic/power, etc. Looking forward to the next installment of this course."
3387,His was my first taste of algorithm design--I loved it! The course was challenging but just easy enough for me to get through in an unfamiliar language.
3388,A nice effort. good if more interactive lessons
3389,His course was absolutely amazing! Developing my musicianship has me making up songs left and right now and I absolutely love it!
3390,"His course is an absolute must for everyone wishing to get a good start in programming. Everything: from the quality of materials to the charm of Or. Severance makes you want to return to the course and view another lecture, learn something new or successfully complete another assignment.To, literally, that is supercool!"
3391,Great into course for learning how to manage your money. Interesting content and the quires are pretty relevant to the content.
3392,"thank you for this course, it's great"
3393,"In order to be more clear with the exposition, the course started with a game theory introduction and that works a lot for me. When the course become more strategic and more applied. Great course!"
3394,Good interactive course.
3395,"I am very disappointed with this programming course. The course lacks detail and depth and could be taught in 45 to 60 minutes instead of 7 weeks. The quires and assignment were to easy and basic (solved in less than 5 minutes) and definitely not enough. Annoying was the verse of colours in almost every video (almost everything was coloured - highlighting everything is just as useful as highlighting nothing, green box with white text inside - did you try to read that on a different monitor than yours?), the painless and useless doubles, smiles and whatsoever, wasting my time by watching you dispose your teabag/drinking tea or coffee/talking about your mug/etc., why do you even need to drink in a 20 minute-or-less video. The Tutor tried to loose a dry topic. Mostly it wasn't my humor but I can live with that. I had hoped for more :("
3396,Quite interesting and very relevant as a good reminder of the fundamental concepts.
3397,It's a great course to go through
3398,Very useful to understand the framework from scratch.
3399,The best online course I've learned by far. Right from the course structure to the content everything was just awesome. The team has relentlessly worked in getting the global guns to talk about the content and created the best content online for trans media storytelling. I've already recommended my colleagues to take this course.
3400,Thanks! Some examples required me to use goose to find out why things are the way they are.
3401,“The method of teaching was fantastic. The assignment were well made and portion appropriately. The instructor was knowledgeable. The class material was splendid and made the class enjoyable overall. I would strongly recommend this instructor & Course to any other student.”
3402,Very interesting course.
3403,very useful
3404,Very useful course. I suggest taking this course straight after R programming and before taking any other courses in the specialization.
3405,"i can not express my gratitude to both of you dear professors. i am also grateful to all of the interviews, they really rich the course with their experiences.thanks again."
3406,"I found this course very much valuable for kiss as well as other elder people. The teaching method was highly impressive and Or. May Dam really inspired me. I wanted to give 5 stars but I found few things missing, such as food recipe were without quantity of items (especially in written format), gardening was described in a very short format (I felt that it required little bit more detail), market visits could be a very healthy and information section, some experts advice & suggestion (including famous chess), some discussion over food available and prepared in hotels/restaurant & also visits over there. Over all it's really a good course and I would definitely recommend to others. By all the best wishes to Or. May Dam such a great work and hope see more from her.Thank you.Regards,Shoukat Shadat Li"
3407,Great course!
3408,"Good course. I would recommend this to everyone who are interested in learning HTML, CSS and Javascript."
3409,It's a wonderful course. But I think the assignment are a bit difficult for design students like me to accomplish.
3410,"A great course to introduce of, it is good for you if you never heard about this topic."
3411,great fun and easy to learn.
3412,"That course really helped/is helping me in my daily life and in my academic/professional life. I'm sure I've got to apply these notions of memory to become a better student, and as a teacher I want to show my students how to improve their results by Learning Now to Learn."
3413,Good stuff. The Professor explained the concepts clearly.
3414,Vice capstone project. It leaves a lot of room for experimentation!
3415,"West of all. It may seems like ""bah bah bah"", but it's full of useful information."
3416,"Great, well structures course. The video quality and editing leaves something to be desired at times, but overall I'd recommend this course to anyone who's interested in the topic."
3417,"Too short, interesting but far too short"
3418,"A great course!! Helped me learn the basis of patron programming and i am going to learn more about this language. Or. Chuck is an awesome teacher, He made the class very interactive and help me understand a small programme in me.. :)Thank you Or."
3419,I wish the courses at my university were this good.
3420,Great course! Beer feedback has been less than helpful.
3421,Thanks from professor De and his colleagues.
3422,It is very good course! I can apply to my Oh.D research.
3423,Great way to learn the technique of good writing. Thanks Coursera and the tutors.
3424,"Totally worth the money and time (weekly 2-3 hours work). Wish I had even more time to further cement my social listening skill, but obviously I am doing this while I try to lead and manage my company, so it can be a little bit hard to balance. I am so glad to start this Social Media Marketing Certificate. 2 down and 4 more to go to complete the whole thing. I am so excited and pumped!"
3425,"Enjoyable, easy to understand, and relevant to life-long learning."
3426,"Terribly difficult to engage with 10+ min lectures in every lesson, plus unorganized presentations and interviews making exacting important information difficult; the lack of organization in the interview video (which are SUPER long) made it very difficult to extract significant information for the course and assignment. I will say that the research and academic reading made available in the course were exceptionally helpful and full of great information, i just wished that that information was presented in a more engaging and interesting way, sometimes more organized as well. Furthermore, much of the reference material should be made accessible within the course rather than simply cited; it looks fascinating but from places like China, database and webster with such relevant sources are often wholly inaccessible. Please include links or entire documents."
3427,"I have had little experience writing code, but wanted to write a little program to interface with a Web API. His course was really good to teach me the basis of API interlacing with patron."
3428,Sometimes lectures go too fast. Would dive more into iss and javascript.
3429,"EXCELLENT course! Suitable to most people, and really helpful to our daily lives!"
3430,"Since the beginning to the end, I enjoyed this course because I learn new things for me. It had good explanations, nice examples and many exercises. Thank you very much."
3431,thank you
3432,"Very interesting and comprehensive. It has the level of complexity that I need: enough to go into details, but not too much so that it can be done in parallel with a regular job and doesn't require too many hours.One topic that's missing and that could be addressed in future revisions: reinforced learning."
3433,"I would have enjoyed it more if I had had enough knowledge to do the Honors quit!I download all the video so I could play them over without chewing up my data, but the quality is so poor you can't always make out the writing - i's and j's all look similar. It would be better if the presentation material was bigger and the facilitate images smaller - you need only see a face, not the whole upper body in the foreground.Nevertheless, I have been enlightened !"
3434,Great course. Great video that are even fun to watch. Perfect course for anyone who wants to either learn Atlas from scratch or wants to refresh his College basis.
3435,The machine learning course is simply magnificent. Andrew G simply clever.
3436,The explanations are very intuition and comprehensible. The lecturer did a great job and simulates provided are as good. Thank you
3437,"His course is well worth a student's time and effort. There are excellent presentations by the professor, but in it's current format the course is too short for the amount of technical knowledge implicit in the material. In addition, the quires are poorly written. Some questions are asked at the end of nodules when the subject of the question is not even introduced until the following module. Further, for some questions the right answer is either not given in the choice presented or the trading protocol doesn't recognize the correct answer. Some questions ask what answer is ""most correct"" which implies that there is a strong element of subjective judgement involved in its formulation. The student is allowed only one attempt at a quit every 8 hours, where many other Coursera courses allow 3 attempts every 8 hours, which is more conducing learning and retaining the material due to the instant feedback. Finally, there are several ""NOT"" or 'opposite answer' questions which are valid but confusing, so the student must be careful when answering.Recommendations: 1. Add at least three more sessions to the class and spread the technical material out over more sessions. 2. Write the quit question set to clarify what you are asking, and make certain the material was covered in the module you are possessing. 3. On't use 'what is the best answer' (""most correct"") type questions, they are ALL too subjective to be fair. 4. Check the trading protocol to make certain it is properly evaluation the answers."
3438,In extremely interesting and information course!
3439,"very good course, well structures!!"
3440,well structures.
3441,I had a great experience with this course. The course content was short and concise.
3442,"Great into about photography, very easy to digest."
3443,His is The West course you have in your entire catalogue. Superb!
3444,"A nice introductory course, short but with a lot of stuff covered, good for busy people. I only miss some query introduction. Thanks professor David Rossiter."
3445,"Very good course on AngularJS, presented in a very clear way. I learnt much."
3446,"hello! how are you! my name is Suis Santacruz and i want to know why i can't download the play along for make the different homework, i want to make them but i can't , i would appreciate if you can send me at my email lsantatcruz@email.com . thanks!"
3447,The content is absolutely amazing. That I didn't really like was that the last assignment was a curve ball to me and most of the other students in my class. There was very little preparation to it and thus took a while to understand how to get started on it.
3448,Good basic course if you have no background in Finance. Reviews the important concepts that can get you along easily.
3449,It was really an honor to have this course under your guidance. Thanks a lot for guidance and assistance.
3450,Not good as this topic was not taught in great depth. For beginners it is good.
3451,"Great place to start of! I wish Jump was used instead of Active. I've heard people say this is an easy course. Well, when you think of exercises, the solutions are usually just a few lines of cod. But in my opinion, the challenge is to understand each concept so well that you can explain it to an of neophyte.Important advice: To ask/answer questions on the forum. I'd definitely recommend visiting the forum when stuck.It the end, I just want to thank Professor G and his wonderful staff. I hope to see you guns start an advanced of course soon.!"
3452,Another fine MOOC by the prof. I really like her dry delivery style.
3453,Too easy!
3454,Course content is really awesome. Homework assignment will help a lot to learn more about the course content.
3455,One of the best course to learn machine learning. Assignment are just awesome.
3456,I loved this one. The one I wanted to learn and I am feeling fortunate
3457,Very interesting and challenging. Thank you so much Or. White and to all the Course Management. You taught me a lot.
3458,The course provides an insight into the world of diplomacy with recent examples of failures and successes. I would highly recommend this course to policy makers and also to those seeking to widen their horizons in diplomacy.
3459,"Wonderful course, thank you professor Miss"
3460,"I do not understand why these courses over lap. I finished #2 today, tried to start #3 but found that I had 10 hours to complete the first weeks assignment? Who is in charge out there?"
3461,Finished
3462,Wonderful Course ... His course is first to learn before learn any other course
3463,Great course!
3464,"It is a good course, however, I would have liked deeper knowledge in git"
3465,Fantastic course. Well presented and I learned tons!
3466,I really love this course. Easy to learn . I hope Peking University can open more higher level course.
3467,"Great and well-explained information on the subject. Plenty of relevant into on the brain and body in relation to both learning and well-being, as well as practical study tools and practices. The course also had a great structure; well-built for retention of the material, and applying the principles explained in the course. Really happy with the experience and information provided, and I will make sure to apply the information and learning tools during my pursuit of knowledge :)"
3468,Very nice course! Good starting point of learning SAS!
3469,"While thanking Prof. Uric and my peers for a good experience on the course, I must say that this has been a great learning opportunity and I am looking forward to sign up for the next course and onward until I complete the specialization."
3470,Great course that could stand alone.
3471,"Thank you, Or. Very and Coursera! His has been a useful and interesting course. It is very well-structures and easy to understand and everyone from real disaster workers to just a person who has everyday life, needs these skill. Thank you for great examples in ""George and Nina"" video also!"
3472,A good first course for beginners
3473,I had a lot of fun completing this one.
3474,Very Good Knights and tools.
3475,Perfect!
3476,awesome lessons!!! easy to get on hand and every piece of of is crystal clearly explained.
3477,"It is a wonderful experience. His course not only reaches you knowledge of social media marketing, but practical ways to motivate your growing in social media marketing."
3478,Easy to understand and very client introduction into the world of game design. I liked it a lot!
3479,Exceptionally well presented. Great focus on transporting the intuition rather than just presenting formula.An only recommend this course for everybody who wants an in-depth introduction into the most important concepts of machine learning.
3480,"Good course, easy to follow. Stayed away from complicated, deep-gives of information"
3481,Awesome Course! Interesting speakers!
3482,"I thought the professor was really great about explaining things in a clear, concise manner. I think some of the quit problems were more complicated than they needed to be, especially considering that tying in a long string you're very likely to have a type which results in missing a question you knew how to do."
3483,"Very good information and resources provided. Unfortunately if you don't pay for the course you have no access to the assignment. His is the only course of several that I have taken where this is so. Surely, those non-paying students could still submit assignment, it is possible in other courses why not this one?"
3484,Lots of material covered and very unable.
3485,"His was very information course, especially with the optional reading. I learned a lot of the basis around initiating and planning projects as well as the terminology around this area in project management. The video were information while being short enough to watch in one sitting."
3486,Very good content and presentation
3487,Useful and very friendly to learn !
3488,"Interesting and inciteful. Or. Line is an excellent instructor! Thank you, sir. I hope you will present more classes from Yeshiva University!"
3489,"Must awesome. His was my first online course and, because it was so good, won't be my last. Andrew G is the man."
3490,I like this lesson.
3491,I like the intervention of computer science and biology!
3492,It is so useful to learn why you can not learn well.Knowing how our brain works then use it in a proper way makes learning more easier.
3493,Perfect course that it's easy and fun to learn.
3494,I loved this course. Amy Shopman was awesome at teaching me. Her video re bluntly explained. Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!! I forgot to mention in my introduction that I am a fourth grade.
3495,Great course to start in this topic.
3496,Good class. Clear presentation and learning programming skill.
3497,Love the instructor giving tips on how to make compelling presentations in addition to teaching technical aspect of Tableaux.
3498,Very helpful introduction to OOP course
3499,Very Good course.Good examplesExcellent quit and exercisesSlides are also very clear and easy-understanding
3500,Excellent interviews with people who are integrating the universe story in their works in a very creative way.
3501,Absolutely wonderful. I learned a huge amount and Giacomo was a very friendly and helpful teacher.
3502,Adjective and Adjective Clauses are such a pain! It blows my mind off! :-) Thank for that course. It is very helpful!
3503,Great course! Really learned a lot from it!
3504,"Awesome course, thank you Andrew G!"
3505,Very clear explanation. Enjoyed watching and learning. Thank you the team!
3506,"The content was interesting, but the quires didn't relate to the lectures very often. It was as if there was a major piece missing in this course. One of the questions even reference a book that was never mentioned or made available. Also, several of the musical sections seemed to be in the wrong place. I think maybe this is one of the classes that doesn't work well in this format."
3507,Great course!
3508,Good basic introduction to the topic.
3509,"Of you are looking a general HTML Course, this is for you. His provide general knowledge to create simple web pages, some basic HTML tags and a few practices. By expectation was to have a deeper knowledge of HTML5, spend more time reviewing difference between HTML5 version and the last ones but, I didn't get it, this why I'm giving just 3 starts"
3510,His introductory course gives a pretty much clear idea of the basis of marketing analysis. The practical based approach actually works if its taken seriously. Lots of examples covered and the questions are tricky. All in all I have been quite happy with the progress that I have personally made through this course.
3511,His is great course
3512,Great Course !!
3513,Pretty good and solid information. Looking forward to weeks-4 as well.
3514,Really superb course. Thanks Flex and Prof Navarro for giving this course
3515,Magically structures and well paced.
3516,Good overview of buddhist meditation
3517,Very nice layout of the course. Easy to
3518,very good information and very useful content.
3519,face course and mortification even helps us in recruitment processes.
3520,Great course for beginner to get into web developing
3521,"Quizzes are trivial. Takes the mortification worthless.Prof. Campbell is not a good lecturer.The topics are treated mostly superficially, then suddenly go into too much detail sometimes (how to use IntelliJ IDEA, machine learning).Subtitles are very buggy.I enjoyed Or. Farivar's talks much more, it seems like he knows what he is talking about and his presentations are well structures."
3522,the best. with first hand materials
3523,Amazing!! It would be great if the limit dates were defined by the knoll date instead of having a specific period of the year it can be done. But really good work!!
3524,"Thank you to Andrew G for a great of introductory course for a person with programming background. It gives a very good start for anyone who is clue-less about what ""machine learning"", ""data scientist"", ""neutral network"" etc. really mean. Assignment are designed just right - so that a newby is not overwhelmed, gets confidence as s/he progresses.Is I mentioned I consider it introductory course, because it gives lot of information which you tend to forget as you move through this course. To you need to practice a lot with real life example before you can become an expert.Now the challenge is finding a problem that has not been tackled using of and trying to tackle it with what I have learned."
3525,incredible :) It makes me feel the amazement of Calculus
3526,I thoroughly enjoy the course
3527,Excellent. i have learned not only about happiness but how to lead my life. Thank you
3528,the scholar writing becomes easier after taking this course. it is definitely an interesting course.
3529,"Wonderful course, its not easy, for sure, but what else could you expect from Off Into :)"
3530,The course is very helpful.
3531,"I found much of the content to be interesting and timely. However, I thought the quires were poorly written. There was no feedback, so as a learner it was hard to grow from errors. Also, there were many that required more than one answer, if you missed one, you missed entire question. Without feedback, it was difficult to know which one you missed. The week 4 lesson content was a bit dense for an introductory course. It was dry and could've been more global. Last, the large lesson assignment was only grade by peers with no feedback from the instructor."
3532,Very intelligently designed course!
3533,Very interesting content and the assignment can be used in the classroom as well. I enjoyed the fact that they provide extra material at the end of the course.
3534,I enjoyed this class. It is very open and organic. Creativity is encouraged and very few restrictions and rules are imposed. I found the class to be well-taught and I looked forward to participating in every week of class.
3535,"Superfluous but the existence of the package ""caret"" covers the gap of other libraries like ""skilearn"" of patron"
3536,"Very good overview about the topic. The calculations could be explained a little more in detail. Some failures in the quit. Very good moves with good learning material. Anyway, it's a 5 Star course !!! The a lot..."
3537,Great course. Learn a lot of useful knowledge from seven lectures.
3538,"Well, I've learnt a lot of things, thank you so much!!!"
3539,I have learnt so much from this course.
3540,"In general this was an easy, interesting and enjoyable course, Video interviews and lectures by key researches in this exciting field were a highlight. It's an introductory course so not deep, but fun.A couple of things significantly detracted from the course for me.One was a feeling of unqualified evangelists. I think the microbiome is indeed a huge important field, but the level of hope here, and lack of any critical perspective, was off-putting. His is particularly disturbing for products like probiotics, which have become a huge industry with little solid evidence to support them, or to choose between them. Also, they devote a lot of time to selling the American But Project. Which is a good cause, but I would rather they had spent that time teaching me something useful. I resent being dumped into watching as when I've signed up to be educated.The other thing that gathered me was the course required us to diverge a lot of personal information to other students in painless, time-consuming projects. I didn't learn anything from these projects and found them annoying."
3541,Enlightening with many real life experiences. Thank you for having me.
3542,"Very useful for beginners, Simple, end to the point, and most importantly contains drones :)"
3543,it is good course
3544,"It was a very good course. It was not only a legal course, but also a course concerned with economic thinking and logic thinking about what law is and why law is. I am a practicing lawyer. The course widen my eyes on legal matters and makes me think more deeply than before. It should be strongly recommend for legal students and legal professional."
3545,Not happy about course 5 & 6 got canceled.
3546,Very useful!
3547,It is a great course for anyone t o learn the basis of things to consider before launching a successful business enterprise.Buds to all U Penn professors who have dedicated a lot of time to create this master piece of an online course.
3548,thanks ~
3549,It is an excellent online course with top world class contents which I have never had! Any thanks! Ice
3550,"Great material, enjoyed the pace, and insightful mix of artists and concepts."
3551,Vice video. Learned a lot. Also video good for future review.
3552,It was a wonderful course. It gave me great insight into animal behaviour and welfare issues that really enhanced my knowledge and experience as an animal lover. The course is well structures and comprehensive.
3553,Great way to get started with Bootstrap's functionality and gives you a way to go past the short but important course content and firing things out by yourself.
3554,"The course content is very solid. It focused heavily on the tools and technique, and there lacks the concepts and biology behind those tools. But I would guess there is some prior courses in this specialization explaining the concepts, though I didn't take them.The tools explained in this course is the most popular ones for handling up-stream analysis. They are the must-have ones for current bioinformatician jobs.The instructor, Or Liliana Flora, did a great job, walking you through those tools step-by-step. I also found the exercises (exam) highly useful.The course title is not the most accurate one. The title is not very catch either. His course is more about the tools for analyzing next generation sequence data."
3555,"I loved this course. It filled in a lot of knowledge gaps that I had. By only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because the of portion went a little fast, and it was difficult for me to keep up with it having minimal experience with of."
3556,"In excellent course, covers a wide variety of areas and beautifully executed."
3557,"It is really hard topic, but thanks to the Professor everything is really clear. Thank you!"
3558,Good way to get to know how to present digital marketing ideas to clients in a coherent manner.
3559,was nice
3560,very interesting course developed with high pedagogical approach
3561,Great set of materials. Great introduction on data analysis
3562,Wonderful course!
3563,I totally recommend this course for an introduction to of. The professor makes each session very interesting.
3564,Awesome course.
3565,Very good online course
3566,"There is some good material in this course. The text is fairly good. But I have two main reservations about the course. The first is that the lectures do not always correspond closely enough with the quires, and with the text. There are times when one can take a quit and think, ""Now exactly does this relate to the lectures I just saw?"" The text has quite a few exercises, but there is a tendency to throw in one or two problems whose difficulty is an order of magnitude above everything else in that section, and I find this discouraging and a waste of time. Have those for a later course, or put them into a separate ""Extra Challenges"" section. Learning calculus is hard enough without trying to grappled without some really tricky trip problem at the same time. as a single example.The second reservation is with the instructor's manner. Any students find it very enjoyable. I am not one of them. Such of the time, he's of, especially when the camera is not pointed at him. But as the course progresses, much of the forage is of him at his desk, and the closes become more and more extreme, the hand-waving and fist-clenching approach sheer windmilling, and the exaggerated eye-rolling, grinning and so forth become so distracting that I can't bear to watch. I realize that the goal was to avoid being a dry-as-dust droning professor, and that is commendable, but there is a happy middle ground between that and humming. I can almost speculator that there was an impulse to add in cartoon spring-bone-cuckoo-platon sound effects. (There is actually one such sound effect, but just one, so I won't bubble on that.)I would have found the class more effective with a demeanour that was enthusiastic without being histrionic. I'm sure this is one of those ""you either love it or hate it"" things, and I may be in the minority.The instructor is not generally one to throw out some concept that has not already been learned and then just motor on without explanation. He ears on the side of overlay-detailed explanation, which to me is preferable to shipping over subjects or technique and assuming you know them.Having said all of this, I repeat that there is good material, and you can learn the fundamentals of calculus for free in this course."
3567,His is a very practical course for a non-native English speaker. It's easy to understand.
3568,"I love teaching style of Or. Harris, simple but inclusive. He guesses what you are thinking while you are watching the video."
3569,Informative course
3570,"I don't even have a child; I'm in college, and the simple tips in this course helped me eat soon much better this smelter and even lose some of the frenchman 15."
3571,"Good into to patron. Gets you on basis as well as loops and conditional statements. The lectures cover the book materials and are helpful for understanding. The worked examples are often straight forward, but occasionally require some debugging and extending your thinking a little past the current material."
3572,"Great course, really tied in nicely with all the stuff I have been learning about sinfulness. Moved the presentation style and content."
3573,It is what I was looking for!
3574,In general it was an interesting and thought-provoking course. The only minus was that we weren't able to download a of version of a book to which the professor kept referring. Recommend for anyone who wants to get to know the basis of economy.
3575,Too difficult. The lessons go too fast.
3576,The course lacks deep theoretical understanding of the concepts.
3577,"Overall, good information that is very helpful for making the transition into the of field. I wish the lecturer didn't trip over his own words all the time - it made it hard to listen to the video's."
3578,Good to review some key concepts of the English Grammar.
3579,"Extremely enjoyable exploration of Buddhist and current thinking in psychology. Thought provoking and challenging, whilst also entertaining."
3580,Very clear and complete for a first approach to the ASD
3581,I enjoyed this course. It was very information and I think it is a good way to start studying the subject.
3582,"Excellent class with a rich variety of instructor from multidisciplinary array of fields, lots of extra information and pretty much any question answered!"
3583,Very useful and interesting course
3584,His course is useful.
3585,"Like they say in the course for bachelor students, this is very helpful. I study history, so I always and up with millions of sources. Not only have I learned how to search intelligently, I have also learned to manage my results and papers carefully."
3586,"Basis of psychology, very friendly and nice professor. A good introduction."
3587,this is great
3588,Great course with a different perspective on history&people. Run and simple.
3589,"I believe this course can be performed much faster, beware that it is really an introduction, and of professional persons may feel it slow, in addition the presented speaks English very slowly, good for non English proficient persons, but bad for the others."
3590,"For all the many courses I took on Coursera, this course is one of the best."
3591,His Course is bad! I try to ask for help and then senators only reply with I can help you because of the Honor code. Well tat doesn't sound like much of an honor code to me. Of course I am doing my own work due! I just need help. Wont we all need help from time to time. I think Coursera needs a lot of improvement. I am extremely dissatisfied with Coursera and this course but especially the senators and their lack of entering. Education should be uplifting and positive and an area where individuals can ask question and receive help and not be scolded for asking help or asking questions like a beat down dog. I mean really I think Coursera needs to go take some hints from a real school or university and seek information on education and how it is best when students teach each other and Of I can ask for help and learn from others and give then the opportunity to help me that what the point of a discussion board. To away with the discussion board or change the way the honor code is written. Yes I agree with Honor and doing your own work but come on. Help and tutoring is a valuable part of education and necessary to learning! Please make the necessary changes to better Coursera and make it a more positive educational experience. I mean please I am trying the best I can with what I have got and no one seems to want to help me learn and improve on my skill and my understanding. Take changes and make them now.Another reason I hate this course Is that Coursera does not believe in people helping one another. When the senators can even explain how to work through the problem. The manors make things more distressful than they need to be because the dont give help or hints or clues. People need to talk to people on the phone or in person or the instructor needs to give better examples so people can better figure things out on their own. I just think Coursera is cap and this has been a very unpleasant experience for me. When on the discussing board i see others struggling with the same things and the months dont help them. People are pleading for help and not receiving any guidance or direction to help them figure things out. Things need to change with this program. They need to change soon!
3592,I like this course with clear description
3593,"Enjoyed the format, enjoyed the instruction :)"
3594,It is very good course and give a better understand in calculus.
3595,His is one of the best course I ever had. I have learnt a lot from this course.
3596,"its just great the way he explains everything, makes it so much easier to learn.. even on another language.in from Mexico and i use this house to complete my understanding in class, i wish all my cases where like this course.Thank you for this."
3597,"Superb Course, Thank You!"
3598,Really helpful. I wish I had this course at school/university.
3599,Love it! Must love it!
3600,"Very interesting course, very cool teacher. Thanks for allowing me to go through it. I have a busy job, a baby at home... but it was worth the time... I recommend!"
3601,Good lecture with suitable teaching speed which is helpful because the formula and abstract magnetic concept are difficult to follow. I recommend this course!
3602,"I have enrolled in this twice but can't see the course content. Very time I click ""go to course"" I get directed to the description of the course. There are the lecture video and other course content?"
3603,Greetings from Mexico!Thanks for this course.
3604,"Thank you for that course, I was really waiting for it to appear in Coursera. A lot of new information, looking forward to the next course!"
3605,"I love, love this course! Congratulations to Or More and to Ana for making it so interesting! I completed a Classical Studies undergraduate degree years ago and it is wonderful to discover so much of Ancient Some's history, art and archaeology. A+"
3606,"It`s an excellent course! quality of teachers are great, the information of each module are actualizedand i regard that The learning`s methodology is appropriated. Completely recommended."
3607,"The course is very effective, helpful and motivation! It reaches to look at things from different perspective and makes you to be more optimistic and mindful. A Great Fig Thank-You to everyone involved into making this course and, especially, to its organizations. Recommended to all, even those who are already happy! )))"
3608,It is a fundamental course to improve your writing skill. It is very useful for everyone who in any way writes mails
3609,"good information, thanks"
3610,"I liked the course. To improve, could become more dynamic , but the teacher is to be congratulated ."
3611,I learned a lot new things
3612,A little challenging for Ruby beginners but extremely rewarding
3613,Exceptional and essential guide for music producers. His course really makes you think of music production from a politic perspective. I'll never listen to music the same superficial way anymore...
3614,"It gets 3 stars only because I learned new things in the class. But the teacher (Less his heart for meaning well) ended up being rather annoying and distracting with his constant antics. It's okay to throw that in every now and then but this was really awful, makes you want to forward to the parts where he is normal. That's when you can pay attention to him and understand it all. Think you should ask him to tone it down big time... Everything in small doses is great.I think there is an unfair marking system in the last week - I wrote about it too. I don't want to pay for a course and have my points cut for silly reasons. Of that's how it works, I never want to pay for certificates. That's the point in paying for 'subjectivity' or 'having to adapt my answers to suit the course'."
3615,Love it.
3616,Excellent teacher!
3617,His course is recommend for beginner to learn on how to create their own apes.
3618,"Lectures were interesting and well put together, however the assignment and the knowledge required for the assignment were not covered in the lecture material. While I can appreciate that every course will require some elements of self-learning and exploration, this felt a step too far. By sense is that if you have some experience in the actual topics covered by the course, and are looking to verify your knowledge with a certificate, you will be fine. However if you are hoping to actually learn about the topics, you are going to have to work very hard. I'm hoping that the coverage of course material to assignment requirements is a lot better in the subsequent courses in this specialization."
3619,very good explanation about basic programming and algorithms. Help you a lot to get the concept
3620,top
3621,"Friendly learning curve, like it!"
3622,Practical and really helpful! I designed my resume as it is instructed.
3623,"Vice and hard course, which is good :)"
3624,Great introductory course for Fig Data .
3625,Very interesting - the quality of the video can seriously be improved though. Already with little effort by editing away the duplicate parts.
3626,"Impressive course. I found most of the course useful, and will definitely use it in my life."
3627,It is a really helpful mental tool for learning in varies subjects. Thanks!
3628,"Thought-provoking course that validated many of my experiences. Helpful tips and framework for women and men alike. Thank you, Or. Bilimoria!"
3629,"After trying several courses, i can say that this one is the best so far. the rhythm of the lessons and the clarity of the lectures are some of the most valued virtues that i found here. it is really enjoyable to keep going thou the weekly lectures."
3630,I loved the course especially where Or Skyhorse talked about rising action. The assignment are very engaging and this course has been a great learning.
3631,Great course. Easy to understand. Good material for beginners
3632,i really enjoyed this class.thanks!!
3633,I would recommend the course for everyone who is either beginner or an intermediate researcher like me
3634,"Interesting and useful, one of the best courses for learning¡"
3635,I enjoyed this introductory course because it really provided the scope for this area of study and helped chart the course for the rest of the specialization as I move forward. Excited to move on through to the next course armed with what I have learned in this one!
3636,It was a very nice course for basic English grammar
3637,"I found this course useful in rousing my short stories. I found the lectures useful, interesting, and directly applicable to the assignment."
3638,A great prime to get you started in Data Science or get up to speed quickly.
3639,I loved it so. I'm an art maniac so I found it dear
3640,I learned a lot of things about AngularJS and Javascript.
3641,"Great Course! Challenging, but the instructor help you to do it!"
3642,"General knowledge of bond and equity market and its impact by micro economic aspects.Last to see that professors are not native English speakers, but was ok.Some lessons, performed by certain professors wear significantly less enjoyable, due to their performance."
3643,Wonderful course on research principles and the creation of reproducible R reports with knit.
3644,"It is perfect for beginners, but if you're an experienced writer you might be looking for something a little more challenging."
3645,Overall the course is good. A bit too short.
3646,"His course probably deserves 3-4 stars in a better, maintained form, but the entire specialization is not maintained, the lectures have no production values. Basically, it's a money pit that Coursera is keeping up cynically. It's a real shame because the syllabus correctly addresses a gap in most data scientists' skill."
3647,"Good course. Coming from a traditional art historical context/content. Which is still a very valuable methodology in this age of ""Visual Culture""! Thank you."
3648,His is great course for beginner
3649,Well structures. Well paced.
3650,Your course was very educational and fun at the same time. I hope I will use the learned technique in my lifetime.
3651,"Good introduction, peppered with interesting interviews of people who initiated something new in the Open Source world. And a lecturer who has humour. It was fun to participate."
3652,His was an excellent course that was well taught and offered practical and real unable assignment. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to learn about graphics design while learning how to apply concepts. The professors lectures were clear concise and very well organized and gave great examples for each concept discussed.
3653,Great course!You get a lot of ideas and energy to keep teaching.
3654,Excellent course.. I love fundamental of graphics design. Highly recommended
3655,"Municipal Solid Haste Management in Developing Countries is a great course. I learnt a lot of new things. I'm presently studying Civil Engineering and this course helped me in broadening my knowledge about Municipal Solid Haste Management. A lot of thanks to Or. Christian Zurbrügg, Manor Zabaleta, Felix Schmidt and EPFL & Coursera team for this brilliant course."
3656,I found this course to be very interesting and informing.
3657,"Will Morris is a wealth of knowledge and experience - I only regret missing out on the classroom dynamic of a Morris-led discussion of Southern arts, particularly the Clues."
3658,"Instructor speaks very fast so that i read subtitles instead of hearing what he say, in addition to i stop video more times to understand what he say, but totally the scientific and technical contents are great also his advises for us in which how we can find the answers for our questions about data science"
3659,"The instructor at the University of London were excellent personalities with very good communication skill. Once again, perfectly online education surpassed expensive in-class university classes in preparing people for the digital economy we live in."
3660,Fantastic course if you are interested in happiness!
3661,Very interesting topic about Saw and an economic aspect of Saw and its application
3662,The tips and tools were simple and very useful.
3663,Met another brilliant course.
3664,such A good lecture!
3665,The first part of this course gives excellent introduction to base computer hardware principles.
3666,"The material is very information and generally well presented. I would have liked more video explanation about the minimum snap trajectories as this was a large part of the final assignment.Of the Atlas resource was an actual desktop application instead of online, the assignment would have been much easier and quicker to accomplish. Atlas online, in my experience, is slow and hard to work with in a single brother window.Overall, I enjoyed this course."
3667,I really enjoyed it!
3668,thanks guns.
3669,"The fact that knowledgeable people have put together such a programme is a very high score. Secondly the rate and pace at which the video and lecture notes have put together and presented is a high score. The supplementary readers, some of which can be download and studied at oe's own pace is very audible. The end of week test is well structures and no matter how you might have read and viewed the video, one still need some time to grasp everything. The end of course examinations receive very high score from me"
3670,relevant contents would be nice to add a practical piece e.g. sell social media marketing program to our top management using tools from the course. it would be 5 stars thenanyway welldone to developer of the course!
3671,"Really helpful, thank you."
3672,I'm truly enjoying this course. The material is explained in a clear and effective way. It will most certainly help me on my day to day work.Thank you
3673,Tutorial is very good.Explanation are really easy to grasp
3674,"Good introduction to basis. A few improvements are warranted:Lessons could be ordered in a more logical progression, particularly when it comes to It.Gitbash is not easy or intuition. A more structures approach (e.g. with cheat sheets, command glossaries, structure diagram, debugging algorithms etc) would help assimilate it."
3675,"Very uneven. There are some good insight and ideas in there, but no way will a beginner be able to make sense of this. It's more like a sort of refreshed/inspiration course."
3676,I love this course. Easy explaining so it's easy to understand.
3677,Excellent course for student of any stream.
3678,The contents look great. I just can't wait to begin this course.
3679,Great course for all people who meet for first time with this science with very charismatic instructor. Highly recommended.
3680,"I love this course. I learn a lot about typefaces, I used to picked the type just because they look pretty... so wrong with that!!!"
3681,"I give this 4 out of 5 stars mostly due to some technical video/audit issues with the material and its presentation and editing. Also, there didn't seem to be anyone moderating and only a few other people taking the class so not enough forum discussions to help us out. Additionally, I'm also disappointed there isn't a part of that continues into of approaches to the subject. Finally, I think a bit more rigor and theory could be introduced into the video before just pointing to the accompanying textbook. But I understand the tradeoffs. Looking forward to part of (please Or. Each!)"
3682,"I like this course, it helps me a lot during my master of social work application season."
3683,Great course with good learning content
3684,"Great Course, Full of insight"
3685,"Great tips, however assignment are mandatory even for users who don't want to upgrade."
3686,I found it very interesting
3687,Awesome course
3688,"Excellent class, thank you so much!"
3689,Wonderful lecturer and very well presented accessible content. Thank you so much.
3690,"Moved the course, the teachers, the case study approach."
3691,It is the most hilarious course I have ever done online - and I mean the pleasure with learning. Not everyone can say the same about any baths course.Thank you for this wonderful course on Calculus.
3692,The exercises included help a lot in practically understanding the matter. I did not find that in other courses and it was a miss.
3693,it's the best.
3694,"I've learned so many good things i did not know about internet, it's just so amazing to look back in the history and find out how much effort people put into practice to build what we call today internet , Absolutely a great course!, Absolutely a great course!"
3695,Great course and instructor!
3696,"Unclear assignment, lectures are brief and sometimes unclear. Spent more time trying to understand what was being asked than actually learning."
3697,Excellent class -- interactive with interesting video and exercises.
3698,"Good course. Prof. An is very good. Only I miss a deeper discussion, more complete examples and assignment. Thanks a lot."
3699,Some more hands-on examples on shield will add more value.
3700,In insightful and excellency-paced course!
3701,"Very good information, thank you so much for all experience gained through this course."
3702,Good course
3703,Excellent course for understanding the basic principles of buddhist and the logic of them.
3704,His is extremely helpful course. Thank you very much for everyone to make it possible
3705,Very nice intensive course. Love our professor - she's great!
3706,"Great Course, great technique used to teach machine learning, makes sense!"
3707,A very interesting and useful course for those who want to learn how to clean data in Python.I loved the opportunity to work directly on the notebook as I was listening to lectures.I think that more emphasis should have been put in the pro and sons why and how of using the hands limb. functions in order to accomplish tasks.Assignment were very instructive and well explained by staff in the Discussion ForumMany thanks to the staff and to U. of Michigan for the course.
3708,Very good course with a clear explanation of the key concepts. Thanks for giving us the chance to learn with you.
3709,"Very interesting introduction to the business intelligence, totally recommended."
3710,Its really help me a lot to build up my basic concept and now data wrangling is quit bit easy for me.Thanks :)
3711,Clear and well organized!
3712,"A lot of information, easy to understand, good quality of lectures and interesting practical exercises! Thanks!"
3713,The lectures are so thought-provoking and enlightening... Thank you very much!
3714,Video Lectures are really great and easy to understand with hands on programming tasks. Very interesting and information. Learnt a lot within 4 weeks time. Definitely recommend for anyone interested in creating webster.
3715,\Great course
3716,"Very inciteful course, they have set the bar really high!"
3717,Currently I am taking this course. To far it has been very good. All the Assignment I try to do it on my own with out referring to much of the hints. It gives 100% clarity on various algorithms once completing the assignment. Over all very very good course for beginners. For who look for mathematical rigor this is not the course as it is more of implementing the end expressions using Octaves. More useful for of engineers who work in companies than Researches.
3718,His course is excellent. I learned English in school but forget it over time. I found this course an excellent source to revise my English writing skill.
3719,I very much liked this course. Am reading this book:http://www.amazon.com/History-Modern-Middle-Last-th/up/0813348331this course is a good addition. I think it is necessary to also read about the topics because the course covers a lot. Still without reading I think this is an interesting introduction to get an overview of the past centuries. One may get lost in some of de details but the teaching is very good so you will always get something out of this course.Hopefully more courses on the middle east will be available on Coursera in the future.
3720,Very useful information. Although you need statistics knowledge this course gives you a good broad perspective of the correct analysis practices you need to develop in order the have the right marketing insight.
3721,very good! thanks for the class
3722,Very helpful and information. It really adds my knowledge
3723,"Very insightful! The course is taught in a very dynamic way providing examples, video, and instructions insight into the development and plan of a solid of Campaign!"
3724,Up-date content and well explained concepts .Added value as reading and links . It really engagement me to going on for the next.
3725,His course is great. Very interesting world of digital marketing out there that i wasn't aware existed. Round some new great things in the world thank you so much for sharing!
3726,"good in general, theory part on complexity is too tedious"
3727,"Excellent course. In my experience really good teachers are uncommon. Andrew does an amazing job of leading this class. The material reflect lots of thoughtful preparation and Andrew works through it in a very engaging manner. I found the conclusion very touching. There's a bit of that throughout the class. Is to the content itself, given I'm new to of it's hard for me to say how thorough or deep it is. It does cover a *lot* of ground and I did find it challenging."
3728,The course should provide a free statement of accomplishment if not a verified certificate
3729,"Great class, a lot of fundamental stuff."
3730,Good topic great teachers
3731,Good course.His course made my midst about learning changed.
3732,"I have started this course again and again. Although the lectures themselves are clear enough, the quires are sometime so confusing and don't reflect the way that topic was taught. The worst part is R lab. I understand nothing of it. It makes no sense. I should not be part of a basic statistics course. I have wasted my money on a specialization that I can't get because I will not, and simply cannot learn R. They should have made that clear this would involve programming. I am only now thinking of learning from the video but have given up the hope of getting a specialization certificate.The instructor in the first two session was still engaging, but starting in the third lesson the instructor is so boring and his voice makes me drowsy. Plus his sentences are so long and confusing. He has a horrible way to explain something. They need to keep in mind this is BASIC statistics, so cut down on the margin. He does introduce the terms in 3.01 but just after one video the words don't magically sit in my memory.I've given 3 stars because although I have to work double hard just to make sense of what the instructor says by reading a book on basic statistics, at least the video provide a structure, good examples and after watching them a few times things become clear."
3733,Great Course led by a great Teacher !
3734,"excellent course to start with amputation, programming and patron."
3735,"I really didn't learn much. Too much code, too complex, too fast."
3736,I enjoy this learning path with Or. Severance. He made the course fun and easy to digest. I love the fact that I can learn with my own pace. I also enjoy the satisfaction from solving problems through the assignment.
3737,I am so pleased Coursera offers this. Journey of the Universe has been an incredible learning experience!
3738,"I really liked this course, can't wait for the next one :) easy-to-understand video, good exercises (with help if needed), great enthusiasm!"
3739,The tutorials have the ideal information about the data science course
3740,Over my expectations!!! Really good introductory course.
3741,Great lecture series. It really make you want to travel and see where this stuff happened.
3742,"I` m a zero on guitar, but I can keep up with the course, and I can feel my improvement."
3743,His is no real need for this course. Everything sounds like bits and pieces from magazine articles.... I suspect the sole purpose of its inclusion in the specialization is to fund Coursera. $79 at a time....
3744,I joined to learn outstanding experience but ... disappointed
3745,I can't understand why this guy is trying to teach me if he doesn't know how to code?!
3746,"Eve of difficulty was above my expectations. Moved too fast. Would have been more thorough in applying the content to examples similar to the quit. Seemed to stick to the bare minimum of what would be required before moving to the quit. He transparent with future prospective students that this course absolutely requires knowledge of calculus, probability, and statistics."
3747,"I really enjoyed this course, it has helped me how best to manage my studying technique. Thank you"
3748,Great course. Learned a lot.
3749,Great course
3750,Thanks for this course.
3751,"His is an excellent short course for someone who knows some programming and/or is somewhat familiar with HTML. Of you do not know anything whatsoever, the pace may be a bit too fast. But if you are a bit familiar with programming (in any language), you will enjoy the course immensely and learn an awful lot."
3752,"Amazing course - I learned valuable knowledge; how to craft effective interviews, avoid stereotyping, build credibility, what news literacy is and how to promote it, the importance of portraying as survivor as opposed to victims, how to use social media and crowd-pouring and actually a lot more.Instructor were succinct, clear, professional each with easy to follow and pleasant decadence. Slideshows during presentations were very helpful. Overall I have come away with a great understanding of how to gather and develop the news in a wide range of situations.I have signed up for the next course in the specialization. I definitely will be taking all of them, these classes have given me extraordinary value in my skill."
3753,Very good!!! I like this course and the hair style of the professor. ^_^
3754,"A very well put together course, only slightly marred by poor audit recording. Would recommend to anyone interested in the concepts of machine learning."
3755,A really great start to understanding patron. I would very much recommend this course to anyone looking to get started programming.
3756,A very good Course!!
3757,Wonderful perspective on finance.
3758,Easy to grasp the concepts to apply when using this approach.I enjoyed every bit of the course
3759,"Thanks a lot to all the teachers and assistants, you have helped me a lot. The lesson structure is clear and the explanation is easy to understand. I think it would be better if we can get some knowledge about some toolboxes."
3760,Have is a great researcher. His class is taught with great clarity and expertise. Subtitle is much less impressive though.
3761,"The exam answers were not clear.... The were questions not related to the video. His was an expel course and no excess were available to download, just PDF. In the other two courses (Quantitative Modeling and Accounting Analytics) the excess were explained and available for download. His was an expel course and no excess available....."
3762,THANK YOU!
3763,"Thank you for your efforts, from the bottom of our hearts. Such gratitude."
3764,Perfect to start a change :)
3765,powerful course
3766,Interesting introduction to programming.
3767,"His course is great! well organised and clearly argued! I followed each and every section of it and all the reading and recourse are well prepared! Would recommend to anyone who is doing research in law, technology and sociology alike!"
3768,"Great course, much to learn in a short time but with an excellent guide."
3769,Vice basic into.
3770,"I learned so much from May about healthy food not just for children, but also for myself."
3771,i will love English with you
3772,Or venue's lectures were very helpful for understanding the key take=away / skill / tips for motivation yourself as well as a team. His lectures are very clear and easy to follow.
3773,"In eye opened, really glad I registered and finished it. Thank you, Barbara."
3774,"Dear sir,its great to study with youCan i have a favor please,An i have a hard copy certificate from NUS, it's sad because i want to learn this course because i love NUS a lot, can you give me a favor please, it will be more meaningful to me to spend time and try my best to pass all 5 nodules"
3775,"Nutrition is such an important factor to living well and reaching total human optimization. Giving with young and growing kiss, I took advantage of this free course to find easy-to-do recipe as well as becoming more educated on the benefits of eating natural, organic whole foods. By favorite parts of the video were the scientific explanation and the illustrations that followed."
3776,"By first step to know about DNA, epigenetic, human ancestors, and genetic engineering. His course was great!"
3777,"Why do you like what you like? That do you drink peri when you'r blind to the brand, but you choose cock-cold you aren't brand blindness? Why do like something is not the same to want something? Why our emotions are so cognitive and our cognition is so emotional? You anna know it. Must take this course."
3778,"I love the animation, and the professor is very engaging."
3779,"Very useful material and great class video, thanks Andrew!"
3780,Excellent Start to the machine learning world
3781,His course allowed me to improve my resume and show a new opportunity to look for a job.
3782,"I had the clear sense of actually learning and not just ""copying & passing"" bits of code. The questions and problems are challenging enough to make you stop and think about you just learned."
3783,I come from electrical engineering background. I found the material in the course very insightful and easy to follow.
3784,"Great course, great professor, but terrible, time wasting, frustration, not educational (no feedback at all) evaluation ""machine""."
3785,"Of you are interested in viewing the ellipse you need this class. It has excellent, very concise information about the ellipse and the sun. NOTE: Weeks 2 - 4 are about the sun. Weeks 1 and 5 concern the ellipse."
3786,very insightful to help me gain a better understanding about waste management and increase my knowledge on how to reduce my own carbon footprints
3787,Quite difficult to digest for a beginner. Hope the examples are easier.
3788,A good course that covers all the basis.
3789,great introductory course for the engineering and analysis that goes into exacting power from wind.
3790,Good introduction to Unity.
3791,thank you!
3792,A bit basic but reaches a lot specially the difference patron has compared to other programming languages.
3793,His course taught me how to program.
3794,Great course to learn how to make your comic book.
3795,"Though a little dry at times, this course is extremely information and provides examples of every main topic it covers. I also appreciate that each lecture is broken into 3 segments, for when I have limited time or attention span."
3796,Great course opening up better understanding of how to learn and giving a lot of practical advice and clues.
3797,Great teacher. By only complaint is that the course doesn't go very in depth into web scraping.
3798,"I loved it. I learned about something that was completely unfamiliar to me(computer programming) prior to starting, and I have now continued to learn it because of this course. Professor Harris is the man."
3799,"I think it is really necessary to establish better the target auditory for this course. The students with very basic level of English have to study with advanced non-native speakers and with natives. The exercises can be too challenging for the first category, sometimes boring for the second and absolutely superfluous for the third."
3800,"It's the very good course, the professor has a incredible form to explain."
3801,"Great material and wisdom, really makes you think in the real importance of a well written story in a game."
3802,"Challenging, detailed, just the right amount of everything you need to start learning Python. However, the lectures were painfully long."
3803,Excellent course. Exceptional lectures and fantastic course materials. I learn a lot valuable skill which i will use in my future learning. I highly recommend it to all students and life-long earners. North every minute spend on it!
3804,"In information, easy-to-understand introduction to child nutrition and cooking."
3805,"Unfortunately, without a doubt, the worst und most uninformative course I've ever taken. Part from stating the obvious nothing new. A lot of repetition of ""useless"" information. Super disappointed. An't believe that such a course is offered here and that I really paid for nothing of such quality."
3806,"It's simply amazing.People spend a lot of money to learn about plants here and there.But,it was unbelievable for me to have such wonderful n extensive lectures from the speakers around the world on every clinical aspect of plant dentist.The best part was i can learn wherever and whenever i get time.a big than to all the senators and course.Love from Or Having Prajapati,Ahmedabad,India"
3807,With it Calculus is easy! Would have more creative homework though...
3808,"Excellent course. It is probably less structures, than the University of Michigan course (by professor Siedel), but contains a few breakthrough insight that the Michigan course lacks - eg a more defined concept of a pie; a more structures approach to dividing this pie; the principle of ""never say no to a proposal, make the other side say no to your proposal instead"" etc."
3809,Great course and presentations!
3810,I am really satisfied with the course. I learnt new ideas and concepts about English grammar. His is a wonderful course.
3811,Simply Awesome.
3812,"Have completed HSK Level 1 and have benefited much from this Course. I am now able to converse basic Mandarin to food vendor and friends, Wish to provide a few feedback for improvement. Certain Sides are slightly faulty, and the certain audit of two of the Meekly West are not available. Also, the Chinese writing strokes be given stroke by stroke and at the end to mention the words and the meaning. Wish to say Thank You to my Teacher U In for teaching me. I wish to proceed t o HSK Level 2. Would I continue with the Lesson 2, again with financial assistance."
3813,"Very methodical & lucid way of explaining the concepts. Understanding of Special Theory of Relativity made relatively easy, put intended! Thank you Professor..."
3814,Awesome Course. Awesome.
3815,"Nicely explained but a bit boring for me. i believe that is my fault, because i don't like web design and i also knew a lot of the things in this course"
3816,Why is this its own class? Seems like it could have been covered in a week somewhere else.
3817,"may buena. he aprendido castanet. very good, i had learn so much."
3818,"The previous Coursera forum format was far more useful than the current, new, format used in this course."
3819,Really great for beginner. Learning with fun!
3820,"It was entertaining, but it'd be easier to follow if the video weren't *that* long. 5 video of 10 minutes per week would be better in my opinion, it wouldn't frustrate me as much as an hour long video."
3821,Great content that is relevant to my work in marketing. I've already used the skill I've learned.
3822,"The course has its positive, but overall does not perform well instructing on the use of the two statistical software offered (SAS & Python). It the beginning they offer multiple data sets to use and formulate a research question, but all the examples utilize only one data set and do not cover the differences you might face with the other data sets - leading to a lot of missed opportunities. Additionally, the tutorials for using the statistical software do not lend themselves towards a thorough understanding and more to a route learning."
3823,"It will helps every body who want to enhance skill related present growing technology,and thanks to course."
3824,this is the BEST course I have ever taken. the course's ideas and learning methods are conventional but I can touch for the fact that they work. thanks to all the creator!
3825,Great course!
3826,"I,I am sad from Pakistan.I increase my teaching skill through this course."
3827,Professor Miller is a genius.
3828,I highly recommend any of the courses given my this instructor. His was interesting and enjoyable.
3829,His Course is fantastic!!
3830,"His course strikes a nice balance between providing a solid foundation while being traumatic enough to be able to apply it to real projects. Also really enjoy being able to submit your developed program and get instant response on how you did, a rewarding feeling."
3831,"Easy to absorb, the audit examples given in video are good for those who do not understand the basic concepts/terms explained in notes alone. I feel this was a helpful short course, that is both efficient and well organised. Really reaches you to work smarter, not harder ;)"
3832,Vice course but should have more practice exercises and Coursera should make interface more interactive.
3833,His is an awesome course to start and get yourself confident in coming. I loved the instructor Charles. He was funny and made us understand complex things using simple examples.
3834,"Very good, excellent course"
3835,His course gives an excellent tour of the thought of Aristotle and his successors. The course focused on the main points of Aristotle's thought and gives the student an excellent frame work for understanding Aristotle's thought without getting lost in the details. A better course that leaves the student capable of going off and reading Aristotle on their own would be hard to produce. Great job.
3836,Very bad or non-extent support
3837,Course as described and exactly what I was looking for
3838,Moved this course. I felt so empowered after taking it.
3839,The word 'toolbox' made me think there was more in the course. 'Introduction' or maybe' Overview ' may have been more accurate. Good course otherwise.
3840,Pretty good course. Enjoyed
3841,I'm Current Working on Give Star Sedan Loud Management System.Have Three parts Desktop Controller (Admit) + Mobile Pp (Customer) + Was (Loud Technology). It was recommended by Coursera and I start it for understanding how Loud Technology Works. I gain a lot of free Education that is not available in my Country. Thank you my Honorable respected Air Long Soon Hung and Onset University South More.
3842,His course was everything I thought it'd be. It was a simple and fast course to learn about personal branding and what you stand for as a leader.
3843,"The course is very well structures and gives overview of whole flow and systematically prepares us to understand each of the part. I am really looking forward to Crypto of, where will be described more things about certificate and new exchange protocol. Thank you."
3844,Please add Case Studies in every week.
3845,"The course is exhaustive, and enjoyable. Not even 2 years of MBA can teach us these concepts with so much flair."
3846,"His course is a solid booked in preparation for the Capstone Course. The processes and exercises for closing a project are very often overlooked or under-emphasized in the professional world. His course presents great tools and exercises that can not only close a project on a high note, but indeed even improve a work environment in general."
3847,Excellent and helpful specially the instructor's mind blowing smiling face.
3848,excellent course very thought provoking thank you
3849,A very good introductory course on Python data analysis !
3850,I liked the course because it allowed me to complete it in my own time. The material was well document. I would have liked to have my questions answered in real-time and interactive maybe to others taking the course. There were some quit questions that didn't reflect the material in the course so I got lost and had to find my own answers on the internet. Overall...I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to learn medical terminology.
3851,Absolutely worth my time!
3852,its the best course ever
3853,very nice explanations .....than such
3854,Very interesting course. Really good lecturer and well organised classes. Moved it!
3855,"The course experience was a little bit weird. It's too easy for a dedicated programme or of person, but there are some obstacles to a person who are not familiar to the Javascript programming. (And maybe Python programming, too.) The main problem is too small community. I wrote some, but never got any answer. I think it's due to the charging policy of this lecture."
3856,Excellent course. A must for all students of every age. Is a parent it helped me on how to better guide my children in their learning.
3857,Great course!
3858,Really enjoying the review of the course.
3859,Now when and how to grow a business successfully with this course.
3860,really good and well structures.
3861,Moved this course. Lots of great into and fascinating ideas. A must for anyone interested in astrobiology!
3862,"Great interest in working with various global health sector in the near future, particularly Sonya. Marking on this course will be a stepping stone."
3863,Is a good course
3864,Very interesting and useful!
3865,"Good course, though I have to say that the final project was a bit confusing, and I am not sure that the people who did the final project really understood the course and how to create a tidy dataset, as the ones that I looked at did not meet all the principles of tidy data that were outlined. That concerns me is that they all had similar issues, and are all doing peer review of each other - this means that there is no one that can make sure that their answers are really tidy..."
3866,More than a course. More than poetry. More than it's international community. More than edifying. More than inspiring.
3867,"simple,practical and very clear"
3868,Good Course
3869,"His course provide a lot of references, it is well organized, although maybe you will need more to do it than the time estimated."
3870,In excellent into to financial markets. The course covers a lot of ground on history and technical aspects of the markets and the features within them. Professor Achilles is a world leader in the subject and you'll be surprised and confident in his class when you start noticing his name appear in everyday life. I see his name in news articles and his work is reference fairly regularly when I'm reading about economics and business.
3871,"The tasks are easy to perform. In advanced course , which also requires scores is needed. The revisions are not made by the tutor."
3872,Great course!
3873,"I very concise overview. The teacher is excellent. I would have liked more real life examples,e.g. looking at the numbers for real life companies and comparing them to others and seeing what we could learn from these numbers about these companies."
3874,"It was my first online course and it was great.From coming details to high level heuristics, the content is broad and well-structures. Excellent Machine Learning start point.Course is nicely adjusted to online format. Friendly video explanations, relevant exam questions, and practical and didactic assignment. Andrew and his team created a memorable education experience here."
3875,Very structures and great. The material is very easy to understand and the explanation from the lectures was super. Thank you.
3876,"I really enjoyed the assignment! Her video were different from the other two courses in the Specialization, and I enjoyed that! I loved that I could see her process so that I could attempt on my own. Highly recommended class!"
3877,Very helpful! Pretty challenging assignment and well organized lectures. Looking forward to the second part!
3878,A very good lecture.
3879,Very useful and interesting course. Thank you.
3880,"His is an absolutely amazing class. You will learn a great deal about the story behind our solar system, and the competing theories behind some of what has happened. It's wonderful, interesting, and at times even funny. It is worth every second of frustration and effort I put in.I only took two science classes in college. Of you have never taken a college level science class, this may be difficult. But it is extremely rewarding. Of you struggle, keep fighting. You'll get there!"
3881,Really good for a true beginner. Enjoyed the lectures. Well paced.
3882,Very good content ! Very interesting interviews with expert in the field that shows real examples. However the exercise needs a bit more work to be very useful.
3883,"Some of the SCRUM, of & Agile Practices can be better explained. I have expected a few more things here."
3884,The course is really interesting and it is very clear.thanks a lot of !Sylvan
3885,"Great course, contents are very accurate and comprehensive, explained in a simple manner."
3886,The topic was so interesting but the content was not enough practical!
3887,Good introduction to the course!
3888,"Very well structures course, gives a solid foundation to web development!"
3889,Such of the code is outdated (I'm using patron 3.5). Six this and you'll have 4 or 5 stars easy.
3890,"I have been interested in the history of Israel. His course gives a good summary of history of modern Israel. I learned that modern Israel really had to go through a lot of conflicts and struggles. I liked the video but it was faster to read the transcripts. To if you want to save time, read the transcripts."
3891,I like these two lectures!
3892,I'm very interested while taking this course as it's very related to my recent study.The material and syllabus are very easy to understand.Thank you very much
3893,"Really helpful. Very interesting. Especially the focus on evidence based intervention is going to be really helpful at working with people with ASD. Is I worked with adults with ASD I found it very good, that this group was referred to too, not only children with ASD. I really enjoyed the course. Thank you!"
3894,"Back of examples, sometimes it is not easy to understand what lesson is about"
3895,Excellent and Interactive Course...
3896,Yes ! this course is very helpful.Well done team!!Thank you so much!
3897,Professor Stefano Patella is very clear and schematic. It is able to transform the complexity of the subject in a simple way: ability to have great knowledge of the subject and experience in contact with the students. Totally satisfied with my choice.
3898,Great course!
3899,Would be improved. There is more need of involvement of senators and was.
3900,"His course was dynamic and amazing. I found myself returning to the interface after class was completed to see if there was a second class to continue progress. I felt depleted to find there is no other course to continue the learning in this area. Thank so much. I really got a great deal out of this course and pray I can visit it to practice off an on, while I am taking other Coursera courses for TESOL."
3901,"Quizzes were buggy, but the lectures were good"
3902,I am learning so much from this course. It gives a very good introduction to the Machine Learning.
3903,quite interesting... better if was aware of the site few week before
3904,see is the best
3905,"just some basic knowledge, most of the knowledge is not expanded or deep introduced."
3906,"His is a good into course which introduce the Finite Element Method step by step, which suited me perfectly since I hardly code in c++ nor did FEM before.Nevertheless, as a graduate student, the pace is very slow, and the outline and motivation unclear, which would likely have discouraged me if I did not review video in x, and stuck to second week lectures and onward.I would advise to introduce more outline and motivation at the beginning of the week lecture to keep students motivate.Part from that, I recommend the course !"
3907,without any doubt the best course among those I have studied or tried out on and beyond course. a huge thanks to the whole team behind it!
3908,Great course!
3909,A very good introductory course to R for a beginner like me
3910,Thanks A On...
3911,"I've loved this course. The teacher is very clear, the subject well introduced and analyzed, and I see I'm able to apply the skill learned in my own projects. Full marks, and so many thanks to Or Matthew See-King!"
3912,"Amazing Course, well organised and excellent teachers!"
3913,"Very good course, interesting and educational. I really enjoyed it. I wish the professor will give another and more complex course about music understanding that involves specific notes, patches and scales."
3914,The professor is super nice and the course is very helpful
3915,It's a great course for me.Thanks a lot of.
3916,VERY HELPFUL of I of LAUNCHING A STARTUP.
3917,great course for learn and/or update of knowledge
3918,"With this on-line education, I learned how much health information imparts consumers.Healthcare consumers actively explore health information and make decisions about their health. And they get information via a number of resources such as friends and family, printing, electronic media, health care provides, other consumers and so on.It is very important that health information should be accessible to people and medical staff directly related to patients, and I think that the process of health information delivery should be appropriate to the degree of need of acquiring personal information of medical consumers.In addition, I think that the problem which critical to challenge was examined as long as consumers, provides, and information scientists who develop using health information should go through."
3919,Would be good if correct answers are shared for all the questions listed in the quit. Great work. Wish to learn more on the same topic. Thank you.
3920,"Very interesting topics and teachers,thank you a lot from a ex-but-never-end student"
3921,"Good introduction, also for beginners.I found it rather easy, but maybe getting more complex with the further courses in the specialisation."
3922,"I loved this course. It gives a lot of good information to help when I need to influence other people, but my favorite thing is the tips it gives for avoiding others' influence and manipulation."
3923,"I will rate this course 5 star.. it contains good explanation of all MVC components in angularEveryone related to the field of web designing should do this courseThank you ,prof. Jogesh K. Muppala"
3924,"His course is not at all beginner friendly, really hard to follow the assignment and the lectures if you do not have a programming or R background."
3925,"It is a great, brief introduction to Hands. I think it is ideal for someone who already knows Python but doesn't have much experience with Hands. Lectures are well structures with quires interspersed. Homework assignment are also well structures and use real data."
3926,Even the quires make you think.
3927,Complete course with a valid Professor. Thank You Pale and thank You Coursera
3928,"It's a great course. Although the assignment is little tough, you will gain a lot after completing it."
3929,A really well made course for introducing beginners to CSS.
3930,"I found this course very information, insightful and well organized; very useful also for people having ""some"" years of work experience to whom may open new perspective.Congratulation to the professor for an excellent work."
3931,Sides explain very well all the contents.
3932,a good introduction to machine learning
3933,"By first choice and completed course here, two additional courses on soul beliefs follow and I will certainly be doing those as well. I found the material (both lectures and reading references) very interesting and it connected to daily life and many conversations I find myself referencing things that are discussed here. Retired professor, Daniel Ogilvie, is the primary lecturer and he's very easy to listen to. He has a good personality and gets you thinking. Because of the nature of soul and afterlife beliefs is a personal topic (controversial as well) he and the other lectures I found to be very passionate and thoughtful in their presentations. I especially enjoyed the writing assignment and learned not only from writing my own submission but also doing peer reviews.His is truly a one of a kind course in that you would be hard pressed to find one book or class that is inclusive of many different sources of soul and afterlife beliefs covered collectively. His own writing is one of the reading references (as an overview) specifically because you won't find it all under one roof elsewhere. The course discusses mythology, philosophy, many religions as well as atheist, psychology and neuroscience... some might consider the religious segments tabor or settling. Hopefully if you are considering this course you are an open-minded individual. I chose this course to work on for the purpose of personal enrichment and it has spared motivation for me to continue auditing courses after not having formally studied in over 20 years. It was a challenge but well worth it!"
3934,Excellent beginning for some one who wants to understands algorithms.
3935,Great course. Only missing piece is the working information / baths behind the models. But as the name suggests it reaches practical approach towards machine learning.
3936,"For most people this might be four stars. There is solid content here, but I couldn't help but feel a lot of this stuff is fairly standard of/management material and in some ways, it felt like asking, say, a project manager to deliver a data science course. Of you have never done any managerial training or read material on intrinsic motivation, org and team culture, then you will get value. For me this was pretty stock"

3968,"I am really enjoying the in-depth analysis of personal traits and character strength in this course. It helps me to cope with students from various background, and to help them achieve their educational goals."
3969,"His course ought to be given in Irishman year of High School and again in Irishman Dear of College. Or. Valley is a wonderful conduct for this information. In week 4 the ADD brain is discussed with examples of what the world considers brilliant men. Amazing to learn why my learning as well as my daughter's has a ""delay"". I noticed her brain development when she was a baby. May after day I'd try and teach her a new word or sign language or body shape in play. Days later after I thought okay, I'll wait and try something new, she'd do the thing I was teaching her days before. I did not understand this at all. For me now, I see how and why when information comes into my mind, it scatters and then days later, I feel a knowledge chink forming. now. His is something I wish I knew many years before. But it is good now that I learned so much about learning and how to feel positive about how best to use what I have to learn new things. Great course. I believe everyone should be required to take this course early in life... and then refreshed later on."
3970,"Well structures, well explained. Great course!"
3971,The course was a concise and effective review of major concepts. The concepts were well explained and the lessons practical. I have a better understanding of fatigue failure as a result of this class.

Invest in Beta learning - Learning about learning - for the next 30 days.30 days is a great time span, it's just about the right amount of time to add this new habit , Learning how to learn, to your life.Met a hold of the coming month, (there a course starting right now on 22 march2016), and you can find instead of t 2016 flying by, forgotten, the time invested in March/ April will make everything in 2016 and beyond much more memorable. Your self-confidence as a Learner par excellence will grow exponentially.!if you really want to be a superlative learner badly enough, you can certainly do this course with education & commitment for 30 days.When you make small, sustainable changes, things you keep doing, they are more likely to stick.To here's my question to you: That are you waiting for? the next 30 days are going to pass anyhow, so why not Choose To be A Skilful Learner, something you have always wanted to do and give it a shot!"
3998,Amazing course
3999,Incredible and very useful content made in a very good structure.
4000,Moved the authenticity of professor Member's teaching!!! LOVED THIS CLASS!!!

4009,"Of you are looking for an introduction to basic probability concepts, this is a great place to start."
4010,"Brilliant course! Good balance between theory and implementation with Python. Also, very good additional materials - video lectures from Julius Smith, if you want to go even deeper into path theory."
4011,Great information is an easily constable format.
4012,"Door quality. A disappointing experience.The lectures are very basic, thought for people that have no experience in programming. His might be ok, but the difficulty of assignment should follow; instead, they can be relatively hard; newby programme will probably have an extremely hard time solving them, considering that many of the problems they will encounter are not treated at all in the course.The course does not focus enough on what differentiated R from other languages: just a few video on data types, *apply functions, and a tiny little bit of sloping (very unclear). All these areas should have been expanded, and the course should have had more arguments as well.Finally, the assignment are not enough and their trading system is quite poor: instead of submitting your code and testing it automatically, you should calculate some quantities by hand and select the results out of a few possibilities.All in all, I was disappointed with the course."
4013,Excellent course! Congratulations to all the staff involved. Thanks
4014,good course and timely review for me. thanks so much.
4015,I loved this course. then content is designed to acquire strong foundations in fluttering.

Unfortunately I became very busy during the course and failed to keep up. I look forward to repeating it when I have more time."
4017,A bit of repetition with module 1 of the Specialization.
4018,"His course has been structures in such a way that any individual would able to understand the contents without the prior requirement of learning the margin. All presentations are nicely done, good and simple explanation. Examples were given in each lecture in order to enhance our understanding."
4019,"While the information given by Ran was useful, the part where other artists talk is not presented well."
4020,"Overall the course is very good but it gets thicker the further you go, specially if you have no experience in this area whatsoever... Take it from someone who's first contact with Web Development was the first course in this Specialization: ""HTML, CSS & JavaScript"". By advice to students in a similar situation is to look for other sources of information as well and try to experiment with your code as the lessons go by so you can really grasp the meaning of the pieces of code you're writing. Eventually, they'll start to make sense :-)"
4021,"I'm not a beginner in programming, but I think course is very useful for everybody, who want know about patron. And video is very interesting"
4022,Not bad for who have never met the SEO
4023,"His course was an absolute delight! Arnold, Via, and the lovely and talented musicians made this course something I looked forward to every week and have even created a You Tube play list of the quarters studied in this class which I still listen to on a regular basis.

4026,It is very helpful !!!
4027,"Effect course for beginners like myself. Everything was really well explained but not too slow either, the way things were presented was easy to follow, but also interesting; touching subjects close to real life problems we might encounter. Last, but not the least (on contrary), lectures were really easy to listen, they explained everything well, but the feeling wasn't too strict or overlay professional. It was a joy. :)"
4028,ALOHAF course is quite practical and scientific. I am into mid-course and already feeling a lot happier.

4061,The West
4062,"Not too easy, not too hard. Great way to learn fresh material or brush up,"
4063,"I'd rather have assignment for which you really need to change/write code, not just run existing one. Otherwise the course by itself is great."
4064,Run learning !!
4065,"Fascinatingand slightly scar! Anyone who votes should watch these lectures. Some of the ""correct"" quit answers are podgy (illogical actually incorrect) but don't let this discourage you. Also, accepting peer marking is not for those with fragile eggs or low frustration levels."

However, I grasped the opportunity to make up my finance and accounting related knowledge, and passed the course finally after several times of trial and error. The professors taught the course in a very interesting and fun way, which could have been a boring class with lots of difficult and hard numbers but turns out to be a class full of fun and laughter. I like the way the two professors are presenting the knowledge, as well as doing the analysis. Thanks for providing such a course! More courses like this should be organized to benefit more professional or students in need!"

4122,"Thoroughly enjoyed the teaching style of this instructor. Would have preferred to continue future education with the same instructor. The courses do account for time out of the education system. All can also sign on at their convenience and the deadline reminders were a life save. I have already signed up to continue moving forward, keeping an active brain and learning. Thrilled!"
4123,Very information and easy to follow.

4129,His course was awesome. It shows he much there is to learn!!!!!!
4130,"Excellent course, specially if you want to start from scratch. It gives you the feeling of being in an actual class. I've done the whole codecademy patron course, which was very focused on the practical side, and it is great now to do this course to understand the theory behind it, and what was I actually doing. I'll certainly continue. Thanks for the awesome content!"
4131,Great course that covers theory and practice of Machine Learning. Good fast pace
4132,"Its a great course, give learnt the importance to do something now, also i didn know all the stuff other countries are coming through now. i recommended"
4133,One of the best courses on course.
4134,"While the content of the course is interesting and useful, the delivery desperately needs improvement. The professors speak in an extremely monotonous way, making it seem like they are reading their lines from behind the camera. Must awful, and makes it really hard to follow and stay interested and connected with the topic (even when you're passionate about the subject).I would rather have the course in Italian, and read the subtitles, if that means a more energetic delivery."
4135,"Extremely information, but loses 1 star for reserving tests ONLY for members with subscriptions"
4136,I liked so much!! Thank you Or. Silvermann. It's was amazing course.

4143,"It is powerful and useful, In particularly for students!"
4144,"Thank you for setting up this well-done course, which I think may be useful to all interested in getting a better understanding of tropical diseases. Considering the high volume of travellers to areas with a higher risk of parasitic diseases, spending some time becoming more knowledgeable about them can only do good. For those with a medical education background, it may also be an opportunity to brush on some diseases usually only touched on during a standard university infectious diseases course. Some of them are really fascinating from a scientific view point. I would recommend also reading the PDF references, the articles are quite interesting. West wishes."
4145,Excellent Material and good explanations. Thanks.
4146,enjoying the break down
4147,Too much focus on portfolio investments topic. Would expect more on modeling principles in broader context.
4148,"In amazing course!Of you are reading this, please don't miss the opportunity to learn important tools that will develop, not only your capacity to learn new things, but will also in deepen your self knowledge by giving you an interesting insight of your brain and how it works."
4149,"I found this course too advanced for my level of familiarity with statistics. Its true that most basic stuff is covered to be fair, but the progression is very rapid.Is I work long hours and other commitment I didn't have enough time to dedicate to study beyond the time needed just for this course. Of I had been able to study an extra 10 hours a week practicing using the formula then I'm sure I would have got more out of it."
4150,Very Good!
4151,very clear explanation
4152,"More practical application would be helpful in solidifying knowledge. Concepts seem abstract outside of any programming practice. Additionally, flow of lectures seems scattered at times: concepts are introduced then not expounded upon. His creates a distracted learning path that makes it difficult to follow the lessons. (From a beginner programme's view)."
4153,"I liked the way each assignment directly built on the previous one, and encouraged me to work on different aspects of a single game. While this is something I did, it was by no means mandatory, students were also free to create entirely new games from one week to the next."
4154,Very helpful !!
4155,"Great course! I'm a city person who knew next to nothing about horses, who moved across the street from a rural horse farm. I made friends with every horse, but didn't know what sort of care they require. Now I know the basis of their care, and know where to go to find out more. Or. Mortensen did a great job presenting this class, and his love of horses shows through in every lecture."
4156,Fantastic course. Both the lessons and materials were very educational. Besides it constitutes a very didactic introduction to ggplot2 and duly.
4157,Finished
4158,It is amazing!
4159,Absolutely loved it!!!
4160,Create course!
4161,"His is how things get done! One of the best online course for Python-2.7 for getting started. His one for sure, break the ice to get onto the advance level. Or. Chuck is a real master; his method and style of teaching is very effective. I truly appreciate his time and effort putting this course and materials together. The Coursera platform is brilliantly tailor with this course. Thanks to Team Coursera!"
4162,Well-paced course with good accompanying exercises.
4163,A life changing course! A MOOCer tip: take this course before you take any other one!
4164,Too compact and short. Should be integrated to other courses.
4165,Vigorous introduction to Functional Programming. Harder than most of tutoring books but the reward is a better grasp of Functional Programming.
4166,Thanks so much for this course. It is really helpful.Good Luck with your future Courses.
4167,very good for machine learning junior
4168,really nice material and learning methodology

4175,"Too simple, no programming, just theory."
4176,I love this course!
4177,"Excellent course for new learner. But talking little about path, and many mathematical proofs were skipped, so if you eager to find out why, that's not enough."
4178,"Well organized and invested course.The course includes many knowledge, theories, ideologies and references to help the earners exploring and forming their own point of views.Highly recommend."
4179,It was an amazing experience. T
4180,It is useful for beginner.
4181,"His course is easier than the previous three, but will help in gaining basic to intermediate knowledge on graph."
4182,I love this program. Building me up on how to start my scholarship program.
4183,The course is good refreshed as well as advanced to meet enterprise needs.
4184,A very enlightening course ... i would have liked to hear more about the mythology and the gods roles
4185,Magnificent! Very well organized and well developed. It continue from start to finish in a convenient procedure and in a very clear way.
4186,"Designed more for a child learning about poetry for the first time. Some of the facts about poetry aren't accurate. The effort to make the class more engaging ironically only districts from the course material. The time spent attempting humor could have been spent on teaching, but instead a lot of time is wasted by speaking down to the viewer like they are a toller. I did not finish this class as I couldn't stand the video."
4187,"I like this course. It is great.It is not the easiest course ever, but it gives a lot of important information.I do like it has theoretical and practical assignment. To you will have Run and Challenge :)Highly recommended."
4188,I still do not know how to put the application that I created to my phone or make it available to other phone to download.
4189,Great!
4190,"Great course! Interesting, diverse topics with thought provoking speakers. A hidden gem of a course!"
4191,To far it has been awesome.
4192,it's quite good I think. I learns a lot.
4193,"Interesting, inspiration, and brainstorming!"
4194,In excellent introduction into SQL
4195,"Very detailed course, with an emphasis on practical application."
4196,"amazing course!! completed it, still need to set up my profile so i get the certificate."
4197,"A very good introduction to Machine Learning: Depression, covering the wide range of topics and explanations in lucid way."
4198,Great course !
4199,I am really grateful for the opportunity to do this course! I am sure that it helped me a clot!
4200,"The first assignment was very confusing in terms of what was required, and it should be fixed."
4201,Great course! Learn
4202,Excellent course for beginners to learn Python.
4203,"A few last lectures (Future, Cry) lack pretext, or at least appear somewhat out of order, unless one is familiar with the topic. Generally, higher score (10 out of 10, or 9 out of 10) could have been made a little harder to get. Adding a couple of extra optional problems for one point each could be a good idea."
4204,greatly simplifies and practical course.Thankyou Or.Chuck
4205,very helpful
4206,The lectures were very useful and very clear. I learned a lot from this course. Thank you Prof. Rate and Coursera.
4207,Very information (and a little bit hard) but also very interesting!
4208,"One of the best online courses I've ever taken. The video are clear and concise, and most people with an interest should be able to follow along, while the assignment are still challenging enough to keep it interesting and increase learning."
4209,Very good !The teacher is very sweet and handsome.
4210,Great entry to project management - it's only downside is that it's too short.
4211,Great basic Ilyin course!
4212,I've learnt a lot from this course!
4213,It is a perfect course both for a beginner and a professional!
4214,"Excellent introduction to programming Python. The course layout, pace and instruction are well done."
4215,Very nice combination and collection of case studies touching the most prominent environmental problems of today's world. It gives insight to the problems as well as solution to the environmental problems of our own locality.
4216,helped me to learn a lot about internet security
4217,For a started... very complex overview
4218,It's a wonderful course
4219,Great tools for effective learning.
4220,"For someone with no programming background and limited experience working with data, this was a challenging, sometimes frustration, course. But perseverance through the struggle can end in a deep sense of satisfaction. Happily, this is how it was - quite rewarding."
4221,Introduction to Sustainability has given me greater insight on the world on a sustainable path. Whether we are approaching a J curve or S curve. His course broaden your knowledge and sharpen your mind to be a great thinker when it comes to sustainability. And i'm glad to partake and complete this course.
4222,good to start
4223,"a great experience, an excellent insight into Good and Beverage management."
4224,"Very well structures course, with very nice contents. Needs revision for a lot of easy portable errors, better lecture sides and better explanations. The last module also needs a complete revision because it has errors and it is really not well explained (beside the subject is relatively simple)."
4225,I only enrolled so I can watch some of the CSS video. I never formally learned CSS so some of the attributes are fully for me. Not sure how comprehensive this course. I am pretty sure that more can be done in CSS but the course still did a really great job of explaining all the common attributes. It is very clear for me now... and they are good lessons for beginners because it's thorough but not overwhelming. Disclaimer: I have not done any of the assignment; I just use what I learned in other projects.
4226,His is great course of writing.
4227,"Great course! Sons of information explained in easy to understand terms. Lectures were, by and large, enthusiastic and engaging. Plenty of extra material provided for further study."
4228,I really liked the course. It presents simple and yet very good and applicable principles that I'm trying to apply in me everyday meals. Thank you!
4229,"Awesome course! Before this course, I was frightened regarding learning new languages. I am grateful to Course Tutors."
4230,Great pace for a beginner programme. Looking forward to learning more.
4231,"It has been very helpful, with great links to articles. The professor was really prepared and interesting"
4232,The sides are very difficult to follow. It could be better designed
4233,"best path course ever, reached with so much passion and love"
4234,That tutor said is articulate. That tutor taught is easy to understand. That assignment asked to do is useful. His is a easy but practical course.
4235,"It's a great course with an excellent teacher. The studies cases facilitate learning , I recommend it."
4236,Incredible learning understanding!
4237,Awesome! I love how Is. Ana keeps you peeped up and makes the learning interesting. Thank you!
4238,"Awesome, you will learn a lot about how DNA assembled work, but very challenging and time demand in, especially if your background is in life science and not computer science."
4239,His course has helped me equip basis knowledge of Python Hands.
4240,Great classes for anyone who want to learn.
4241,"Thank you, the course was nice, good job."
4242,"I loved this course! Extremely useful and hands on. The course instructor was really impressive, both information and sympathetic, both army and to the point. Totally admired her style of instruction."
4243,Great course about solving problems using Expel.
4244,"Great sources of information, prominent guests and speakers, high quality learning. Moderately lenient in course load, assignment, quires, and peer-reviews."
4245,Great!
4246,"well structures, fits well to beginners!"
4247,"I really enjoy the lecture. However,I expected to learn more about english expression or example sentence that i can use in the email from the video."
4248,"Of you don't have experience programming, this course is probably impossible without extensive online research to complete assignment. Perhaps this is a good thing - I guess we're supposed to be learning how to 'hack' our education and find answers on our own in the future as we lead our own projects. Still, being a complete noon, I would have preferred a more robust introduction to the language. In the end, however, I did feel relatively competent (good enough to be dangerous to myself) in R after 4 weeks."
4249,Very well document and presented. I thoroughly enjoyed the course.
4250,repeat the class
4251,I learned a lot. Nothing better one can say about it.
4252,It is a great course for beginners.
4253,His was the first course I often to learn through course. And this course taught me to study my lessons in an effective and smart way. The way they presented this course and their approach was easy and understandable. Is a student this course helped me a lot.Thanks a lot.His course motivate me to learn more courses too.......
4254,Great course
4255,Great assignment.
4256,"Buy may buena but the test are only in french and the Google Translation is not so lacerated, so I failed in some easy questions"
4257,The best ever!
4258,Video Lectures are good. Ruin taking method is Great. Liked.Thanks for the course.
4259,"Pretty basic stuff, but still good suggestions for new people in the field of time management and prioritization."
4260,Good one
4261,"the course was brilliant.i am very much impressed by the way of teaching,It was great."
4262,His is a great course. It solved many of my writing problems. The last part of the video need some improvement though.
4263,"I really like almost every part of this course. It goes at a good pace for people who have no programming experience. I previously attempted to take a Python course that did not explain enough of what it wanted, and I almost gave up on learning Python. His course is not like that. The only downside to it is that the professor explains almost too much; the pace is almost too slow. Of you have no programming experience but want to try Python, this is definitely the course to start with."
4264,"His section is great for absolute beginners, and I would highly recommend it to anyone new to social media and social marketing. It seems necessary for it to be this straightforward to set everyone up for the more advanced material. Most of this was review for me, but I learned some interesting, fun facts about social media usage and data.The project was peer grade, which normally I enjoy, however, one of my peer assessment said my assignment was missing elements that I specifically made sure to include and address. There was no way to really dispute this, so I feel like my grade on the assignment wasn't fair. That said, I didn't have a bad grade, but I put a great deal of effort into my proposal and making sure it addressed all of the necessary points.Otherwise, very information and enjoyable, and the class participation in social media is great."
4265,it's a shame to split a one month course to four.
4266,"clear instructions, to the point assignment, side information. great course!"
4267,Thank you Air and course for providing such a great course.
4268,"Great source of tools, technique and concepts, that certainly change one life"
4269,Very good course and analysis of the period
4270,"Wonderful course, a lot the information and resource!"
4271,NICE INTRODUCTION
4272,"[Slightly updated according to Michael's questions]The course is fine, but comparing to the previous one - Algorithmic Toolbox - this one is weaker and with lesser quality.Gros: the course contains some interesting data structures and valuable observations. The started files for assignment are in place. Related books are given after each video session. All the tasks have automatic grade. There is a couple of interesting tasks to do.Sons: the material is mostly lectures, and there is even a video where lecturer just reads the article from Wiki (Play tree - has the same information with same lack of some proofs). Expected: add quires as it was in the first course. The course has less weeks - only 4 as comparing to 5 in of. To various important data structures are not discussed. The course has less homework - 3 tasks each week as comparing to 5 in of. And all 3 are usually just implementation of some basic also seen in lectures.I consider the course valuable due to a number of good video and a couple of good tasks to do. But in general, this course has the area for improvement."
4273,"Great course, worth my time, learned so much and feel better than ever..."
4274,"A great introductory course into the field of epidemiology covering all basic aspects of the field. The educators are very well organized and the work load per weak is very manageable. It is to be noted though that the exam can pose some difficulty in first two weeks as some may consider them to focus on trivial, other than that a great course."
4275,"Great instructor, and the quires and exercises genuinely make you think a little bit."
4276,The best course ever!
4277,His class is a recommendation for beginners who are interested in game theory.
4278,Perfect
4279,"Actually, I think this course is over easy. I don't think a person with normal intellect need 7 weeks to finish this course. It just took me like 3 days to finish this course."
4280,"updated , easy to understand and great professor combination all of those quality make this course one of the best courses i ever take it"
4281,Amazing class. Informative.
4282,Thanks for this awesome course. It helped me a lot to improve my theoretical knowledge in building complex solutions based on different approaches.
4283,Great class!
4284,Awful teacher and explanation and material
4285,"It's the basic introduction courses for data science and it's good, we can learn a lot from this."
4286,"The information you learn here, WILL change how you teach languages."
4287,Great introduction to the programming side of Arduino!
4288,Very Informative and can't wait for Part of to become available.
4289,Very basic. Not much deep
4290,Very good course. Some ideas are very impressive.
4291,Great course and fantastic series
4292,"Very interesting, Moved the detail and course work, can wait to do another on from the AMNH. Thank you for a well put together course."
4293,Really inspiring course about social innovation. I strongly recommend it.
4294,"In extremely well organised, information and educational course, with excellent materials including book extracts, web links and video. A lot of time and effort has gone into making this course and it clearly shows. 'Seeing Through Photographs' is a must for anyone who is serious about photography."
4295,"Very good course, difficult at times but the staff is always very helpful and replies in a timely manner. I am taking this course with a friend and we both love it."
4296,Amazing! I feel motivate and want to go on. The basic idea is the best: Changing the midst of the learner into that of a programme.
4297,"Short, pithy descriptions; to the point advice/ suggestions with leeway to alter the structure. North the time."
4298,very good course for data structure
4299,"I found it to be a good started course for the field, requiring no previous knowledge of the subject. Some of the matter, though, was overlay repetition, and the closed nations are very inaccurate.Overall, I recommend this course as a basic insight into the field, the material is interesting and well-structures and it was fun to learn about this one specific aspect of neuroscience in detail."
4300,"The project is a little bit easy yet tedious, a good practice of using Cava though."
4301,Very enthusiastic presentation and full of great information about the Measles. His course was truly a delight.
4302,Great Course!
4303,"I loved returning each week to the video, the assignment, and interesting with classmates from around the world. His class has been one of the very best that I've taken. In to course #2!"
4304,A great course with very enthusiastic and responsive teaching staff
4305,Excellent course! Thank you professor G explaining the concepts of Machine Learning in an easy to understand manner.
4306,It is a fantastic course. It has wonderful faculty and assignment are worth taking.
4307,"Very detailed, Liked optional sections also. Moved it."
4308,Very good work! I really recommend this course to who care about their health.
4309,Great Content !
4310,"His is the touches courses in the specialization so far. But if you manage to complete it, you'll have some really advance skill under your belt."
4311,Really good course.
4312,"His course is great. It the beginning I didn't know anything about Python but now, step by step, I know the basic concepts and this give me the opportunity to study in deep this language in future. Thanks!"
4313,Definitely North It !
4314,"His course is a very good complement to the textbook 'Python for Informatics'. His particular course covers Chapter 1 - 5 only. For the rest of the book, you'll need to follow the ""Python for Everybody Specialization""."
4315,"A great insight into rural and urban management which could be greatly improved with more challenging (longer) assignment. Great video material and instructor, but I would have enjoyed writing and peer possessing more in-depth articles as opposed to condensing as much information as possible into a simple 200-400 words."
4316,"Very useful knowledge and practical skill. The assignment are interesting, fun and practical. Like this course!"
4317,concise and straight to the point
4318,"It took less than 3 days overall for me to finish this course, but I did this just because I wanted to refresh the basis and see if I am missing something. It the end I learnt quite an amount. Prof. Under's explanation is clear and concise. I would take all the courses in this specialization just because of the way she explains things."
4319,Thanks for this class. It effectively delivers the basic and important details about oral communication. Both the sides and the content are well organized. Thanks !
4320,"awesome, very evidently and you can improve your skill in hours"
4321,Very well taught and practical.Love it!!
4322,"His course was short and interesting. Maybe the presented tried a little too much to sell his book but I still watched until the end and found out many new things that I now notice with my dog! I really think this helped me understand my dog in a different way, but I do wish there had been more studies/facts about dogs (longer course I guess). I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about how dogs think."
4323,"Very good teacher with a complete material , excellent examples and exercises . Congratulations !!"
4324,Good introduction to Finance. Very watchable lectures and a lot of useful information.
4325,Very interesting history if telephone technology.
4326,Very useful. I'll be sure to recommend it to my students and just about everybody else.
4327,Great course. Fantastic approach and flow to teach Python!
4328,the access to the course and the quality of the material being taught
4329,"In excellent overview of a hot and powerful field. Interesting and relevant examples. Some types remain, but most are minor and easily discovered."
4330,His is really useful for me. thanks a lot :)
4331,Great course with amazing lectures and insightful content. The lecture style was fun interactive and really engaged me.
4332,Course is presented in a simple and easily understandable way. I never knew programming could be this fun!
4333,It has been a good overview about how to manage projects. It this level it could be useful also for personal projects and not necessarily for professional ones
4334,"this course is very useful for me, the assignment also motivate me because there were deadline."
4335,it is a very good topic on the way improving your English language
4336,"I almost need to come back and listen to these lectures again. His course is pretty technical -- it involves several different digital tools. I found that it was possible to do well on the quires without really mastering the technical tools. Now that I'm trying to put them into use more fully, I find I don't understand them as well as I should have. I take responsibility for perhaps not pushing to understand the first time -- but I also encourage Coursera and @RandyHlavac to perhaps include something more than ""did you get an account?"" checks for the tools -- to make sure students grasp how to use the tools before they move on."
4337,Excellent course !!!I want to keep learningYou are to be congratulated!!!God bless you!!!!
4338,good materials and questions
4339,Very applicable skill.
4340,"I've taken a bunch of Coursera Courses, and these were my favorite. Run to watch and packed with useful stuff I wish I had known a long time ago."
4341,Awesome course. A real life changes.
4342,"as already explained in the preceding question, this MOOC is less well built and thus useful than the preceding one, partly due to the lack of time and efforts to present the tools, among which the score, the savior relief protocol which stays on the whole quite theoretical, and some of the leadership models which are given too short a time for students to really make themselves an opinion about it.too many intervention from Urine and references to what was certainly a nice show, would be good to balance testimonials from young students with more development coming from mature managersthis said, on the whole the MOOC stays a very interesting activity, and my last word will be to thank the team and wish for the of community to become live, as I have found the conversation a very useful and surprising method."
4343,"The Capstone was adequate, but I had hope for a bit more of a challenge. The specialization all together helped me get a better grip on Python Basis."
4344,Very information course if you want to learn the basis of internet technology and security.
4345,The tutoring quality are over the top teaching with well done entering and high quality materials. But I felt a lack of coverage of other graphics design of other cultures such as other countries where many ideas were born. in: Africa and Asia.
4346,Some video seem truncated. But off and start too abruptly.
4347,"Sides and materials are fine, but insufficient for the quires, which are apparently very difficult even for his in the field."
4348,"Interesting subject matter, and important regarding art and history and culture."
4349,"Really enjoyed this course, although it was like a whistle-stop tour of political philosophy. That is probably the one thing I would change about it - the title. Foundations of Modern Political Philosophy might be more appropriate as morality was only briefly touched on. But it was jam=packed with information and education, really good, Professor Shapiro was excellent, and whilst the students were a little infuriating at times, I guess that adds to it too. Thank you."
4350,"Very good course, in particular for international students who have no systematic training on essay writing."
4351,"Easy to follow and practical advise even for someone coming from a scientific, research background."
4352,the course is very good
4353,Awesome course!! Andrew make it interesting to learn. 10/10
4354,"Materials and topics were good, but the course lacks in two things. They stress more on path and theory. I would suggest additional video explaining the implementation in matas would be helpful and would throw more insight to the baths. Second there is no programming assignment, so its a little easy kind of. Of the instructor or the of would help out in giving the assignment and implementation in matas, then it will be one of the ever-lasting courses"
4355,"It's a very comprehensive course, offering an approximation to the notion of human rights that we understand from any system of protection of human rights."
4356,They taught NOTHING!
4357,The course helped me a better understanding of the education world.
4358,His is really nice course . I recommend it everyone who is from science or engineering field .
4359,Good Assignment.
4360,"His is a fantastic course, it covers a lot of ground, it takes you through the entire process from generation story ideas to submitting your work to publishers. I gained a lot from doing it. The peer feedback system is effective and useful. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to take this course!"
4361,I enjoyed this course. It is a concise and information introduction to good management of software product development. Benefits are direct to my current work. Thank you!
4362,"Very dynamic and enjoying lessons that don't spare details, making for a very adhesive and complete course."
4363,"Okay, you know how to take some good photo but It would be interesting if you could edit some pictures to emphasize or change their content. That's post-production and it's the content of this course. I really recommend everyone to knoll it!"
4364,Wonderfully engaging course that was fun to take and inspires one to learn more about the exciting field of Astrobiology.
4365,Great course! Learned a lot!
4366,"Great and simple-to-follow course. It reaches you very useful technique to improve your learning and tackle procrastinator, with day-to-day examples and metaphor. Even though part of the course is presented in a simple and intuition language, some lectures will go deeper in psychological and neuro-scientific explanations to let you better understand how the brain works regarding learning. A must do course for every passionate learner who's willing to optimism his time and effort when approaching new concepts."
4367,Thank you!
4368,Easy to understand and very interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed this course.
4369,Or Chuck - a computing professor with a sense of humour - won me over in the end. His doesn't ask too much. It's clearly set out and you get to have a little go at programming at the end of each session. His course highlight how easy Python is more than anything and that's a good thing. Good coming language for beginners. Good course for beginners or novices.
4370,"I really like the course. Beer review assignment so structures that it covers all the learning we had. Even if I don't understand some concept, the peer review assignment makes sure that I go back and learn again."
4371,"The course is very good! Amazing how the elements are covered and explained. The only thing I missed was more exercises, more scales to practice."
4372,Door video and audit quality. Not worth the price.
4373,Must the same as the first course. Medium-hard quires and a hard programming assignment that is actually harder to understand than to develop.Overall a five star course.
4374,"Really nice course but not so advance, more like popular-science but anyway you can learn a lot of interesting things."
4375,His course is good beginning in Data Science. It's necessary complete with more.
4376,Is soon as I start this course I literally fell in love with Marketing Analytics and I don't have any background in Marketing studies.Great course!
4377,Really good teacher and clear line of course!
4378,easy to understand and very practical and useful in daily life.
4379,His course was fantastic and the additional reading and information were extremely useful.
4380,"Assignment are very easy, and there aren't easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the video."
4381,It's great
4382,Great Course
4383,Excellent instruction with interesting assignment.
4384,His course really shows what you need to know in order to start coming high-quality webpages. It'll open a whole new world to those people who are interested in coming webster and deploying web apes. I recommend it!
4385,Great content!
4386,Thank you very much for providing the access to this amazing course on Social topic. It helps a lot in enhancing the understanding of the definition of social and also provides multiple cool way to promote social skill. That I appreciate even more is that there are a bunch of tool kits introduced in this course.
4387,"I have enrolled in ModPo for a few years now. I was new to American poetry and the range of poets and style of poetry. The enthusiastic (!) approach of all ModPo staff was as enjoyable as has been the depth of learning. By favourite have been Salt Whitman along with Williams and a whole range of others like the Seat poets and later modern style which I have been introduced to and what has sustained me all the way through has been the education of all those at Belly Writers' House over the years I have been enrolled. One other aspect I have enjoyed is the participation of people from so many countries around the world, proving once again to me that people worldwide have more in common than we do differences. Our slogan should be ""MAKE POETRY NOT WAR!"". Although my reading and thinking participation has been kept up I have not been able to contribute online as much as I would have liked, nor joined in the good-hearted consisting of opinion which may occasionally happen; at 80 years of age my physical health is waning BUT my psychological health is constantly sustained , as I have mentioned, by ModPo and the constant voice of Ll Gillies through the computer which echoes across the ocean to Australia. I enjoin everyone who can to enjoy in this most worthwhile course."
4388,"Large topic and well presented. Due to volume could perhaps be divided into smaller, more comprehensive,"
4389,His course is very helpful for helping me walking through my Oh.D. thesis
4390,Very information and helpful!
4391,"The course was great but there were some quality issues; such as incomplete instructions in week 3 quires and some errors in numbers. And the formula bars in the video (i.e. formula within the spreadsheets) were immensely small and we could not see the formula therein. Participants raised this several times in the discussion forum but there was no response from the instructor. Though the course content itself was excellent, the rating is because of the issues mentioned. Otherwise the course was great and I would recommend it to others for the knowledge."
4392,"His course is great. I'd say I became an evangelists of this course. I told about it to lots of my co-workers and I already feel I'm getting better at learning.One of the main issues I always suffered with was ""charming everything on 1 day"". I still believe I did the same during this course. But now, at least, I recalled the material from time to time in various places, explained it to my co-workers, listened to summary video from time to time and testedmemorizing various stuff using memory palace technique.His is a great course! Barbara & Terence, thanks a lot!West wishes & thanks for learning how to learn!Step Andrusiv"
4393,Interesting and useful course as for me.
4394,It gives a very wide panorama of how language learning has been seeing along the times. Above all it makes us to think clinically about methodology and approach depending on the context we and the earners are in.
4395,Great class.
4396,Very useful
4397,"I had fun, that's a good sign. There is something to take away from this course for everyday living so that is good too.Perhaps I was expecting a bit more research discussions, it seemed all nice with the chats but maybe less 'pedagogic' than I might have expected."
4398,great course. learned a lot. fee
4399,"I didn't have philosophy at school, this was my first serious contact with it, and I was amazed! Moved it from the first to the last lesson"
4400,"Introduction to HTML, CSS and Javascript. Enough for you to get started in web-development. I cannot wait for the next specialization's course!"
4401,His course has a lot of extra in it and a lot of food for future thought. The teacher is fun to learn from and I enjoyed his enthusiasm and the joy he expressed in the subject.
4402,"Pollen, the instructor, was very good. The autograder was not good and wasted people's time."
4403,Excellent content and the way of explaining things especially the course notes and case studies.
4404,"Overall, a good course. Low at first. The class first had me concerned if I was going to learn anything new, but toward middle way, the relevance really picked up. I am very curious to see what the Phaeton School team of professors have to share in the next class."
4405,excellent course to understand the oil and gas industry

4424,"His is the first class I had ever taken on the open online classes. I took it to be prepared to take other classes. Honestly, I figured it would be kind of like a reminder class on studying. The Professors are amazing. The have set a high standard for other classes. There was never a dull moment. It was so much fun and I learned so much NEW information but Not only did I learn it but I completely understand why it works. it is great having insight into the brain and how to have it work for you. His is not the standard study skill class at all. The names says it all. I still surprise myself on how enthusiastic I am when I get the opportunity to use the information acquired . It really works . it's like being able to depend on a really good friend. They are always there to help you pull through and won't leave you hanging. By favorite is the Pomodoro technique. if you procrastinator this is the one to help you get stuff done. I have incorporated a lot of what I learned into my daily life. After being in many other classes, I have to say this is the BEST class I have taken. It's the knowledge I use most. Deep up the good work Garb and Merry!!!"

4432,"Great course, very clear"
4433,It is an excellent course and I very much enjoyed working on the assignment. I specially liked Los de Dato
4434,"Very basic stuff. Assignment can be done only in the paid version, but as it's so basic and everything is peer grade for me the course isn't worth the money (compared to other paid language learning classes online or in-person)."
4435,Neatly explained. Excellent Course
4436,10 years of self-help books compressed into a two week course. Instructor are great. Material great. Highly recommended.

4447,Moving Or Chuck!
4448,Very good explanations. Concepts are presented in a comfortable way. To much instructive.
4449,Prof. Andrew G is the best faculty for Machine Learning. He made the course very simple and covered most of the topics from its foundation. The examples he illustrated made it understandable.
4450,Very information
4451,His course is a very good introductory course to Thermodynamics. It has a lot of depth and breadth not just of the core Sciences but of the applications and other ratification too. It is a good course to get a decent grasp of the subject for higher learning.
4452,"His course is very useful for people who want to learn how to speak Chinese in communication. However, I hope there will be ilyin added so that I can try to recognise the Chinese characters. Anyway, thanks for such a great course. I look forward to seeing more courses like this."

4456,His course provide with a lot of useful knowledge about financial market and different types of securities as well.
4457,"I enjoyed Part Two, but not nearly as much as Part One. His change is not due to the professor or the course material; both are excellent. It is the music itself. I simply do not enjoy most of disco and pop artists like Madonna, Janet Jackson, Brittney etc. I hope I do not sound snobbish (or sound like my parents), but mentioning the Measles and former musketeers in the same sentence or course is laughable."
4458,One of the most intriguing and thought-provoking courses I have ever done. I'm really pleased of finding and doing this course. It responds to my desire of doing good to society through business.
4459,North completing as much for the demonstrated pedagogy as the covered material!

4463,"I suggest this course for beginner students, mainly those don't basic knowledge in computer."
4464,I learned a lot about how my brain works and where I was getting stuck. His is a great course for anyone to take to learn more about how you learn.
4465,"A great survey of the last 13.8 billion years of our universe touching on the sciences--physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology all viewed through the lens of history. A thought-provoking overview that what the appetite for more."
4466,"I'm giving this course one star because zero stars is not an option.I wish I had read course reviews prior to beginning. First assignment was tough... but do-able. Second assignment seems straight forward, but the temple they ask that you follow contains small tricks which appear to be FAR BEYOND anything touched on in lectures.I'm actually going to fight for my money back, what a scar."
4467,Great.
4468,Very good Course! Must 3 weeks and I have already learned a lot! Thank you Coursera for this amazing opportunity. I also want to congratulate the teacher Fault Gems for being a very good teacher.

Easy and quick to do food demonstrations, basic enough that students can build upon them depending on what is available at hand.Some ideas just tend to be redundant throughout the weeks, but I guess that is what she wants to stress on. To to processes food!! :)) I just wish you kept the discussion boards open, so we have a platform to discuss ideas and exchange recipe."

4490,Up-to-date materials. Was good grasp of sports science concepts.
4491,short and impactful video.extra-Materials of each lessons are very useful and helpful
4492,Vice and complete introduction to the subject taught in a very lucid manner by Andrew G. Definitely one of the best of courses available online.
4493,"Learned a lot from this class. Helped my have a much better understanding of what a lot of companies are doing with machine learning technologies. Of course, there are a lot of practical know-how that we can only gain from real world projects, and this class is well worth the time that I have put in."
4494,Very information class. Some of the hard topics in the last 2 chapters are not explained in a way that matched with the code terminology but good examples were given to help figure it out further.
4495,I enjoyed this course well as the usage of adjective is very confusing for me. Its worth learning. Thanks for teachers they made things easy.
4496,"Good introductory course! It gives an overview of the global financial market-as the course name suggests. The path problems are a bit hard though. Improvement can be made for the pop up quit during the lecture--it suddenly cut the lecture; thus disrupting my concentration. It think it needs to be properly placed during the lecture so as to help in reviewing the lesson, not disrupt the student's focus."
4497,His course has a lot of good information
4498,Simply excellent from start to finish.
4499,Thank you for helping my to learn patron and Thank you clot

4501,"Very interesting and handy. I'm Spaniard, so most of the things are basic for me such as the use of onion and garlic in meals, and the use of street market for shopping vegetables. But the recipe were fantastic and since I'm a mother of a 1-year-old child, I will put on practice soon. Thank you!"
4502,Very helpful and useful course>
4503,Great introductory course on Financial Markets. Definitely worth taking. Thanks to Prof. Miller and Pale school.
4504,"The content of this course is interesting, I liked the examples, and the material gave an interesting overview of different aspects of machine learning. From that perspective, the course is as advertised. But, where this course goes wrong is value for money - it is very superficial and not worth what is charged.Is noted by others, this is not a course for learning so much as an advertisement for the instructor's own pay software and their other Coursera courses. I'm not against that per say if it was entirely free, but charging for an advertisement is ridiculous. In my case I thankful started with the free model so I didn't lose out, but I could see others being disappointed. I strongly recommend starting the material with a free sign and only pay if you really want the extra trading.By other main problem was with the pace and detail in the course. I would have liked more detail, but I recognize this was intended to be a high level view so I'll live with that level of detail. The material covered, however, does not need 6 weeks worth of lectures. His course could be ~1/2 as long, cover the same material, and be a MUCH better course.Other small problems include some poorly edit video (there are a lot of examples of simple stumbling in the video that should have meant they do another take), very short video (maybe a person preference, but the number of <2 minute video here is annoying, especially when there's a 5-second standard video at the start and end of all video). All in all, there's just a lot of wasted time.When signing up for this course I was really excited for the entire specialization - now, not so much. I'll probably try the second course in the series (for free to start) to see if things improve, but ironically this advertisement video has if anything turned me off their other products."
4505,"Thank you very much Or. Bloomfield ... !!!Great presentation, excellent demonstrations, indoor and outdoor and very assuring oratory skill. Appreciate all your efforts and looking forward to yet another opportunity to meet you virtually.One small area of disagreement though ... I refer to your video ""Week 3, Calling Walls I"" (time frame 5:12) (Now Things Work) topic on ""Eight and Pass"" of an object where you point out two items from the grocer store, namely the Chocolate War and the bag of Rockies.Following information from of FDA regarding Good Labeling Guide, Met quantity of Contents Statement.>>>>>>>3. Should the net quantity of contents be stated in both grass and ounces?Answer: Good labels printed must show the net contents in both merit (grass, kilograms, milliliters, liners) and U.S. Customary System (ounces, pounds, fluid ounces) terms. The merit statement may be placed either before or after the U.S. Customary statement, or above or below it.

4530,Helps me a lot understand how to organize knowledge and study better. Thank you very much!
4531,"Great material, it is amazing that lectures by one of the most influential people in the neutral network for machine learning community are freely available for everyone.The course could benefit from additional topics that appeared over the last 1-2 years (GANs for instance). There was a number of problems with quires like missing parts of question descriptions, missing images or broken links."
4532,"I've enjoyed the material/ideas in this course and the way Oris Pachy presented the information. I do like her Introduction before content, and then ending each lecture with her Summary. And definitely enjoy her Podcasts during the course, they are very valuable and enforcing. (I also appreciate her 'signature chuckle' ... gutta love it.) .... M"
4533,"His course is the best I have seem through out of the web. It is exactly I was looking for.

4540,"His course could do with harder assignment. His last one was just ""run my code"" and screenshot stuff. Learned a lot though"
4541,It is a very awesome introduction to machine learning...Want to start learning Machine Learning? Well this is the place
4542,Like the approach of introducing the subjects with real use cases and have a detailed session on future courses.
4543,"Most interesting to learn more about the leadership 3 Roosevelt in a century high economic growth, Great depression and 2 world wars. Excellent tutor, interesting interviews with specialists and quires and demanding final essay. Any thanks for the opportunity to take the course. West Regards Rest"
4544,make it more interactive
4545,"I learned a lot of interesting things. Both Maria and David were great teachers: they spoke clearly, making examples and trying to speak as slowly as possible (which is good for a not native english speaker as myself). The interviews were another interesting addition to the course, as the peer reviews: they were not created or structures to lead to failure but to selfimprovement an improvement trough other's advice. It was great. I hope they'll make another course like this in the future, it would totally have my enrollment.Thank you, to the both of you, for the things you taught me!"

4566,"Great course for those interested in having a deep understanding of how the machine learning concepts and algorithms work. The instructor is very knowledgeable and is an excellent teacher of the complexities. Students should have a background in statistics and/or higher path (e.g. calculus, trigonometry, etc)."

4585,very good course. if you are looking for a overview of tools in data science specialization
4586,"Good and straightforward content but with so very little written exercises and thus very little room for lecturer feedback - I would not pay an additional 100$ just to get rate like that (I might consider it if the price included the mentioned books though). Still - I find it a very well designed, concise course. Thank you!"
4587,Really excellent guided course. Well explained and very useful exercises. Highly recommend
4588,"Wonderful, useful, insightful, interesting, entertaining."
4589,Scientific approaches. Effective. Great instructor.
4590,"this course is really great. lectures, code samples and references are clear and completeabsolutely recommended"
4591,Good encouraging start for a new come to Data Science but also Coursera. The course material was specific and all topics explained thoroughly.
4592,I truly enjoy this course because I am using the knowledge I acquire during the lectures and applying it to complete assignment instead on relying on quires along to gauge my understanding. The assignment are based on real world examples.
4593,Now I totally understand how to use any Month.
4594,Great class. Very practical knowledge. I wish I would have taken this class earlier in my career.
4595,on of the best courses that will help you to master any subject and will help you to gain a lot of knowledge easily then before and it will open your mind and thoughts for a new very useful technique in learning.
4596,Great Course!!
4597,"Great introduction to programming, I brought the course book, it makes the assignment easier and the content is better understood and retained. The of version is available free, but for me having a paper copy is just easier to flick through, read and reference."
4598,Great course. Parts move a little slowly. That can be mitigate by fast forwarding through parts of the video.
4599,good course good training
4600,dr.chuck you are awesome!!really i started learning patron from many books but after sometime i find it boring and leave it there but in your class i never reeled that you are boring me..really your class is awesome i will suggest everyone to take class of dr chuck..and one more your way of explaining the things is perfect..thank you
4601,Clear and simple. Suitable for beginners.But most of the contents are rather too intuition.
4602,"Well done in terms of mathematical rigor and explaining the basis. One critique that I have is that there isn't enough time spent on intuition around the circuits. For instance, how does the buck converted work from a more quantitative standpoint? Easy to look up online, I understand, but the professor is excellent and I would benefit from his perspective."
4603,"Overall okay course but the lectures are too focused on theory with some applications to the real world. I think this course needs to be reconfigured and taught from an applied focus instead of 30% applied 70% theory.Also the new format is horrible and was are nonexistent as are discussions in general on the forms now. The was were a critical learning component before especially considering that unlike on do where course staff actually participates in the forms, on Coursera I do not think I have ever observed course staff actively participating in the forms."
4604,A very good introduction into what Software Product Management is really about and the first steps to understanding the role.
4605,"There is a problem with the peer reviewing of the assignment. Even you finished all tasks, you need to wait for receiving your grade. For example, I am still waiting for the grade of my assignment, specially I am waiting for more than two weeks for the trading of my assignment in week 2."
4606,"Glasses were entertaining, but sometimes a little mess."
4607,"It is brilliant !By the end of the courses, you will know how to make a basic pp and to be honest it is great fun and pleasure !All the different aspect are well explained, the questions at the end of each course help you to get into the details."
4608,"Pretty good, overall."
4609,"Pollen van Went, Oh.D. courses have been the best courses I have taken and the first I have completed. Her classes offer you what you need and are practical in actually learning the subject matter. I've taken several other classes on the same topics and have not gotten as far or learned as much."
4610,Extremely useful. His course must be taught in schools.
4611,Lots of fun to join in and nice easy pace to complete the assignment. Overall had an awesome time participating!
4612,"I LOVED THIS COURSE!I've always been interested in philosophy and took a few courses in college. That's was over 10 years and I needed a lot of review and refreshed.I am so glad I took this course. The reading material is easy to access and could be easily read on the monitor or by print.The video were phenomena. Well organized, the presentation of the video were excellent and short. Most of the video are about 7-10 minutes with the exception of the last unit. The instructor has a clear voice and she talks slowly, so it's a lot like being in a class. The video are short so I was constantly motivate to get through one more video, but you will be doing a lot of pausing, thinking, reviewing and writing important information down. The into is given in bite sizes, so it is easy to absorb.Quizzes were a bit tough, so they require a review of the material before taking them. But overall, I learned so much, and filled in so many gaps that I had forgotten along the way. I would recommend this course to everyone."
4613,Course ideal for those who want to get started with programming
4614,Very engaging teacher and super interesting material. Thank you!
4615,Great Course! Well presented with nice emphasis on selected themes in the with century.
4616,"His is hands down the best MOOC I've taken so far on any subject. Both instructor's lectures expel in both choice and presentation of content, and the writing assignment force students to think about and understand the material to some degree of completion.Suggestions: There should be a non-trivial grade writing assignment every week. In the whole MOOC format, peer-grade writing assignment are the only instrument developed so far serving as a meaningful assessment device while forcing students to think about the material in a more than casual manner. The multiple choice quires are easily passed by listening to lectures and the material is quickly forgotten afterwards. Students submitting late may also be given the option to transfer their work so far to the next offering of the class."
4617,"It's great, the material of this course actually helps you to finish it."
4618,"I love the way Or. Chuck teaching us, he completely funny and makes me enjoy this course. And the ""Python for Informatics"" book also really fun to read as well as novel. I recommend you to knoll this course as fast as you can! Cheersssss..."

4648,"For newcomers to the art and science of photography this course requires earners to have no knowledge of the subject and leads them to an understanding of the functions of a camera. Through the tutorials earners got to grip with the hardware of their camera and started to move out of their comfort zone. Well it certainly did for me, as someone who has been using a DSLR for over ten years!"

I consider myself a sidelong learner and have been seeking useful technique for learning difficult material and retaining new material. I didn't take to any suggestions from a previous informal ""study habits"" mind-course, and for over a decade, I just resigned myself to not being intellectual able or disciplined enough to tackle certain subjects, but Professor Valley's teachings encourage me to mount and master learning mountains. His was a fantastic course, and I have already recommended Prof. Valley's work to others."

4659,"His course introduces some basic concepts of machine learning. Particularly, neutral network and regularized repression are given a decent coverage. Some popular technique such as decision trees and resemble learning are not touched at all.It's a very well thought out course. The only reason I didn't give it 5 because it's in arrival mode, i.e. Professor G doesn't support it anymore, doesn't participate in discussions, for instance. It was disappointing. Also, the assignment were too easy, in my opinion. I'd like them to be more challenging."

I took this course in conjunction with my home-schooled seventh grade and we both found ourselves sharing some of the most interesting bits of the course material with others. The broad applicability of the course materials and the engaging style of the presented make this class a must-take. Halo nut, Or. Valley and Or. Sejnowski!"
4668,"Some of the video are very basic concepts on how to lead a team (i.e.: Management strategics, common difficulties,...). It is already known things for a manager with some experience leading tears. His course could be shorter."
4669,"Is an Iraqi student I have to give huge thanks Yakov Chainkin. He is enthusiastic and explains the materials very good. I hoped to know more about navigation bars, anything else was amazing.

4685,Barbara is a great teacher and the course is fantastic!
4686,"His course seems 'light' in content - too much time is spent reviewing case studies instead of discussing different ways to create documents that enable reproducible research. Perhaps this should be a topic/chapter in another course, and not a standalone course."
4687,"First, the instructor assumes that the students know so much background knowledge when the students are expecting to learn these stuff in the course. I also feel that this course reaches students to memories steps needed to accomplish certain operations in Galaxy without explaining why it occurs."

4696,Michael Both is an excellent teacher! I loved this class!
4697,"The lecture quality should be dramatically improved. Even at x speed, I feel Iyengar should further practice is presentation and red the video. In the conclusion, Iyengar states that no textbook are available for the field because it is ""new"", but an Amazon search shows several seem to exist, and many of the studies reference in this course are years old, even more than a decade in some cases... so I think better materials for more organized sides must exist. I've taken more than 5 course classes, and this has been my least satisfying. ... I do appreciate the introduction this provided, for free, and plan to keep learning in this space, though not in this course sequence."
4698,Rougher than I thought. Excellent information.

4737,It would be nice to see more examples especially were we have too many formula. I still confused with probability.Also handwriting isn really helping. I am most of the time deciding script. In addition he is reading the formula at one moment and in around 3-4 seconds it appears on the screen. To I kind of listening him while trying to read what is happening on the screen. horrible experience.
4738,"The course covers very useful and interesting topics, not in very much detail though. It is useful to begin with the topics, but it is really not more that a thin introduction."
4739,"While the video are optional the virtual office hours are unnecessary. Of the instructor were to film some of the q&a at these sessions they would be a nice addition, but as is we watch a few minutes of people introducing themselves in a foreign country.Overall nice course."
4740,It was my first online course experience and absolutely great one. The course material was really well-organized and even the ones with no or unrelated background could follow up.

4761,"Wonderful courses, I appreciate it so much!"
4762,I really like this course. It is a good reap of algorithms which I learned in my masters. Reasons for going to further approach and examples are given good. I feel if more real time examples are provided it will be good for students to understand where they can apply these algorithms or they can implement their own algorithms.

4783,In overall excellent course. 4-stars are attributed purely because of the limitations of when a quit can be re-sat (twice in 7 days). His elongated the duration of the course.The material learnt within the course has been immediately applicable in my job - with success.

4819,"The lecture video are not super helpful and the instruction and support for final project is somewhat lacking. You need a relatively solid background coming into doing the project beforehand. Must study the course material is not enough for you to complete your final project, in fact you need peer help or to read more materials to fully understand and finish the project. The quires compared to what is asked in the project is too simple and thus not constructive enough in the overall learning. Overall I would recommend you to have a solid background before proceed with this course if you want to improve your learning experiences."
4820,Explanation from scratch! Must Brilliant!
4821,Great course
4822,very useful material
4823,"I believe this was a very good course for beginners. However, from Phaeton, I would have expected more realistic examples. I would have also liked some hands-on assignment. But, otherwise.. Great, great course from a beginners point-of-view! Thank you so much!"
4824,"Very good course, only 1 BIG disadvantage: you cannot take the quires unless you buy the certificate..."
4825,"Instructor is so passionate about the topic, that it is hard Not to do what he is suggesting. I'll definitely try to sign in to his other courses. One can tell how much effort was put into making this course.Course set, lecture length, difficulty level, it was all appropriate.Thank you for very enjoyable, and worth a will 5 weeks!"
4826,"In outstanding course on a challenging subject. Informative and thought provoking series of lectures from Or Abraham Afsah who is both passionate and well-informed about his subject matter. It should be a required course for all politicians and government officials, whatever country they govern."
4827,the best teacher ever
4828,Must have course on R programming for beginners. Ruin and assignment were engaging as well as challenging.
4829,North a wait. I am privileged to learn of course online under highly qualified and reputed Or. Andrew G.
4830,"His will be an excellent course for undergrads and high school students but not much in depth knowledge and learning strategy for higher levels of education.Teachers show mastery on their subject matter , though their presentation style is not genuine and naturally animated, to the point that it may feel boring."
4831,I love this course. It's one of my best courses I took online.
4832,"Everything the instructor did, he did well. I just wish there would be more."
4833,"I want to thank dr. Part Heerikhuizen and all the team that made this course possible. I'm very satisfied with the explanations and examples that dr van Heerikuizen gave in such a short time that lasted each video. I also look forward to go deeper on the thought of Alexis de Tocqueville, Tax Never and Robert Elias. I have never had the chance to approach this latter author and now that I did I feel very intrigues and interested by his theories.In my considerations this MOOC achieved its goals. I'm very looking forward for the next MOOC about contemporary sociology. I hope it can happen,Thanks a lot to everyone. West regards from Mexico City!!"
4834,"Great! Reaches you how to begin thinking as a designer. Interesting concept, cool homework. More than happy to recommend. Will definitely continue with rest of courses in Trophic Design Specialization!"

4840,Or. Dickson makes power electronics accessible and fun to the beginner and expert alike. Highly recommend for any student aspirin for a career in power management design.
4841,"I haven't finished all of the material yet, but this is a fantastic course. Needed a refreshed on single variable and managed to learn a couple of things I missed in high school."
4842,"The course is great, especially for visiting work previously learned and long since applied."
4843,well designed course and fair evaluation
4844,"Maybe it's great for beginner, but the assignment is too easy ."
4845,"His has augmented impact; it takes you through positive psychology contents smoothly to train you and absorb the concepts and theories in one to one classroom environment; and simultaneously puts you on the way to change and inculpate the POSITIVE attitude by enhancing the awareness at inner level....... Thanks for the course. ONE should also go for Certificate since it is NOT easy to get the same, and that adds VALUE to it. Henceforth, when an applicant would submit Coursera Certificate, I would certainly give weightage at par with Traditionally earned University Certificate."
4846,"His is how an online course should be! Quizzes, Programming assignment, Questions change when you retaken quires! Would've been better if a reference textbook was suggested that one can grasp more information from. I couldn't rate the course below 5 though. Recommended!"
4847,Interesting & Informative.
4848,It's great to help you get insight about basic principles of design.
4849,Information provided are good. All in this course is about theoretical knowledge. One who complete the course has to remember each points when designing a webster and also implementing. Further improvements required in this course to make sure more knowledge when taking this course.
4850,"Professor Chuck for this course is very hard, the discussion section of the teaching assistants are also very positive, very suitable for beginners who are a good program"
4851,"I'm a statisticians, not a programme. There is so much detail and explanation about the statistics and concepts behind how it works, but there is hardly ever an actual lesson on the code used or needed to implement the algorithms. When trying to humble my way through the code, I found, on several occasions, the code in the self-directed lessons to be incomplete (I'm referring to pieces of code that were obviously meant to be there, but were missing), causing hours and hours of anguish and turmoil. I feel like there should be a lot more time spent on the actual coming and learning how to implement it within the code (similar to the st course), rather than spending an exuberant amount of time going through deviations and no time on actual coming and how to implement it within the programming language.Of you are a software designer/engineer or programme, then you should be fine as long as you pay attention to the very long lessons and deviations and can fix the broken code that you are given. There are other mistakes within the quires as well, which make them near impossible to pass. For example, it is unclear which model you need to use to calculate in order to get the correct square foot. In other occasions, the question actually specified to use the model from (3), whereas it actually wants you to use the model from (4) instead to get the correct answer. His course needs to have better quality checks to ensure needlessly lost time is minimize."
4852,His is an awesome class for beginning programme! The course content is easy and the instructor is very the
4853,Interesting course! Simple but useful material.
4854,"Great insight, immediately applicable."
4855,Amazing learning experience for beginners!
4856,Simple and superb
4857,Was great to learn something I never seen as a course in my country. The professor was very great and I'm very happy about everything I've learn here. Thank you!
4858,I found the instruction clear and the information very useful.
4859,its definitely worth ending the specialization with this capstone. The quires are easy but I would recommend watching all the video to understand how all the pieces fit together. The biggest takeaway for me was to see how the database size significantly shrinks when its normalized during the clean up process.
4860,Vice illustrations and concepts are explained in clear & concise way through real life examples and data sets.
4861,I enjoyed this course. I was a good introduction to Python. The video and material are easy to understand. I look forward to taking the other courses in this specialization.
4862,Very interesting and hard to study course! Vice up-to-date topics.
4863,"I had gained a lot of experience from this course, fantastic!"
4864,"The course could be 1-week long instead of 4. The material offered is introductory level. Suites are too easy, programming assignment still have bags, and trading procedures cause a lot of confusion."
4865,I love it!! The teachers are very smart and fun!!
4866,"By first Coursera effort. Seriously, seriously impressed! Or Valley doesn't just have practical technique, her delivery is imbued with a warmth and humanity that will encourage students round the world to listen up and take notice. I found myself thinking that she and Prof Sejnowski are outstanding ambassadors for their sciences as well as the academic culture they hail from. Takes you want to be a part of it!!Thanks guns - I will rate and review far and wide as much as I can."
4867,"Pollen van Went made this so easy and clear to understand. There were some shortfalls with the peer reviewed trading which is the only reason why this isn't a five star review, but the content and the teaching style were absolutely spectacular! I am part of a few novice web designer groups on Facebook and I've already recommended this course to hundreds of members."
4868,"By feeling is that this MOOC is very inspiring in way that it brings out the fact and paradol that we previously were reluctant to say out , and that is we are not saving lives in an effective way and that's how we actually should behave if we are real egalitarians in ourselves. And it also provides us with simple tools to make analysis by ourselves.Space for improvement could lie in that the links between video and reading materials of a same module or block could be strong, at least sometimes they don't seem so hooked with each other to me or I sometimes got confused what these contents together show something different from other blocks."
4869,Enjoyed it. very well explained.
4870,"The entirety of this course can be taught in a few sentences. Of there is too great a sacrifice to productivity for the sake of security, then people will find a way around any security mechanism in place. Of something is difficult to use, then people will likely not use it."
4871,"Intuitively broken down, coherent lessons/assignment and a wizard of an instructor."
4872,"The best course for AngularJS that i found, really good!"
4873,Very basic course
4874,The content of the course has been well-organized and could be easily understood by a non-English speaker.
4875,Learned great things about climate change
4876,"Great content, the teacher makes it easy to understand in few minutes the general idea of every topic"
4877,Very good introduction to a more healthy life style.
4878,I like this course for some reasons:- a lot of understandable theory;- good practical tasks;- understandable and detailed speech of teacher.
4879,It is a great experience and has been developed very efficiently to provide a valuable tool for the insight and education of a very important phenomenon in the global community.
4880,Clear and straight forward course. Homework aims to put you into action! :)Thank you Prof. Margaret Belong and of Divine!
4881,Not so good. The course explains mathematical models and Expel applications but both are not detailed. There are many mistakes in PPTs and assignment.
4882,"Very good and information course. I liked it mostly because of how it explains the ways one can create the video game world we desire and what must be taken into account. I already had prior knowledge on how to create a video game world that was consistent, but this reinforced what I already knew and took it a bit further. Very recommended for those who are beginners and want to learn how to create a world that feels real and is consistent throughout a game."
4883,"His course is an excellent first course in Machine Learning and is definitely worth one's time. The programming exercises took me a little longer to complete than the recommended 3 hours, but the feeling of satisfaction on getting them right is priceless."
4884,His is a very general overview of the topic but lacks depth.
4885,I thoroughly enjoy the course learning how to learn. Hope to apply some of the learning technique to new subjects in the future.
4886,"The teachers are easy to like, but the course content is very lightweight and will mostly teach you terminology with no real understanding.The worst part was the assignment, which could all be solved by a little copy/paste: I didn't learn anything useful by doing them. All the actual algorithms were supplied in a separate module. More than that, many of the suggested solutions were bad coming (like collapsing 50% of the data before training, or writing sixteen special cases rather than a general function) or painless (like training a linear classified on fixed data).There are better courses out there."
4887,"Excellent presentation of the material, providing not only the mathematical concepts but the context in which they are used. Definitely taught as well as my best classes at university, and far above the worst. I believe it could only benefit from some earlier discussion on vectorization vs. using loops, but I enjoyed the challenge of solving that on my own. Thank you for offering this!"
4888,"His course was very effective in earning orientation and skill on understanding social forms, expectations (empirical and narrative) and measuring forms through tools. Its really critical in delivering our activities and programming in more effective and efficient"
4889,Very clear and easy to follow!
4890,Profession Andrew G is awesome!!!
4891,I thoroughly enjoyed the course and I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in learning or fine-tuning their understanding of the basis of design.Very well structures and worth the time!
4892,The course is tough and needs lots of practice and time to handle the stuff explained in this course. In my opinion the stuff should be split into 2 courses (part and part) with detailed explanation of every covered topic.
4893,"A good, fun and very didactic introductory course. I'd like to have more courses on graphics design."
4894,The course gradually introduces you to new R concepts in a natural manner. I highly recommend the Will exercises. Nothing beats exercises that have you actually coming yourself instead of watching just video.
4895,The course was not what I wanted
4896,His course was a great into to user experience design. It parallel a user research projects I was participating in and calcified the steps being used. It also didn't take long and I was able to fit it in my busy schedule.
4897,The course content was somewhat scattered and lacked focus. I think the whole topic of the talent pipeline was completely lacking structure and cohesiveness. Her's presentations were not as engaging as the others and her sides were poorly prepared - often difficult to read and not necessarily related to the topic at hand
4898,"I think the questions in this course do not map as well as they could to the lectures. But, overall it's very helpful."
4899,"With all respect, Professor, if you are reading all our comments, I think you are a really smart person and you should take all the negative feedback from your students here, positively and constructive. Is having good knowledge will never be equals to able to produce good students. Personally, I feel that you should lower down yourself and speak to the level of your students/audience. Use more simple examples, draw a big picture in our minds on what is this course all about, what are we going to achieve, in each of the topics, what are we going to look at and what methods available.For foundation class like this, I think few simple examples and introducing one or two useful methods in each topic would be more than sufficient to us. The objective should be providing us with the basic knowledge, get us interested in this subject, and able to apply those well taught basic knowledge. Is when we are interested, for sure we will go and do more research, and some might even would like to move on to intermediate or advance levels.The key point here is ""speak to the level of your audience"". Even if you are able to talk everything above the sky and up to the moon. Of no one able to understand you, it is useless."
4900,"Informative class as far as how to use an of service to set up, publish and analyze your data. I do recommend brushing up on Javascript as with every assignment, it became more apparent you need to have some background in Javascript to complete the work. Otherwise you'd spend way more time on learning the language than learning the topic in class, which ended up being the case for me."
4901,I enjoyed this course very much. Professor Carry Candles Lagerstrom made a difficult subject easy to understand. Especially for a fellow who at 85 has forgotten a lot of what he learned in college.
4902,"The instructor were very helpful! Emma is a great education who responds almost instantly to your questions in the forum, making learning so much accessible! Definitely a great course even for someone who does not have any biology to pick it up! On't be resistant to learning! To for it!"
4903,A few more technical aspect input will make the course better....
4904,"I absolutely loved this course--it's fun, a confidence-bolster, and it has completely changed the way I study and think about the world around me. I love that it takes concepts that would normally be intimidating, such as 'neutral pathway', and 'diffuse and focus modes', and puts into them simple terms, like ""pin ball paths"" and ""hobbies"". I've learned why certain chemicals in the brain react the way they do, and what stimulated them, and how to better plan and learn the subjects I'm taking. His course also has special tips for those learning science, algebra, and languages, as well as how to better prepare for tests, and how to take breaks efficiently. His course works for all ages and levels; middle school to college, and all subjects, from music theory to chemistry. To yourself a favor and knoll. You will not regret it."
4905,Straight forward and complete.5 stars.
4906,"I really liked the course.It was very interesting and the two instructor conveyed the information in an interesting way, highlighting the important topics/keywords/people..It showed another aspect of the middle ages that I was not aware off.Again Letter"
4907,Vice course. I learnt so much but I am disappointed there's no certificate after all.
4908,It was great leaning throughout the course weeks. I learned a lot. Thank you course to provide such a wonderful platform for quality leaning.
4909,Really very grateful to Prof. Charles Severance. Fantastic series of course on Python. Thank you.
4910,Very good course for states. It gives pretty much basis.
4911,"Thanks to everyone involved with the design and creation of this course.His course added a lot to my knowledge, I hope to meet them again."
4912,"I would not refer anyone to this course. Although the content is well done, the teach piece of the course is sooooooo frustration. It one point during the course I kept rating and rating my peers assignment and the system would not accept it. I later found out there was some kind of teach issue. There was of communication from Coursera whatsoever regarding this--no email, nothing to me or the class as a whole. To, we just had to keep checking and submitting rating to see if it would finally be accepted. I find this bizarre, to say the least. Now, I am in the third course and the SAME thing is happening! I work full time, have a second job, go to school, raise two boys as a single parent and time is of the essence for me! I do not have time to waste! I keep wasting my time with teach issues. That is so disturbing. Somehow or another we should be kept abreast of teach platform problems. His is crazy."
4913,"Very very interactive, Thanks to Or.Chuck for the great teaching material and methodology of his teaching."
4914,"His course was very nice, its objectives were clear and it gave a good panorama of the writing experience. The interviews with writers were interesting and some tips about editing and publishing were really valuable."
4915,I really appreciate this instructor!! He is so considerate!
4916,Great course. I am learning what I have been practicing in my job.
4917,Good introduction for someone who has zero knowledge on architecture
4918,His course is wonderful!
4919,Run way to learn programming in patron.The teacher has an enjoyable down to earth style of teaching.
4920,Very good and easily explained concepts with useful examples. Recommended for derbies as well as experienced programme for a quick refresh
4921,Good introduction - fun to watch and learn.
4922,"His Course is great for beginners, and it helped to improve my English considerably."
4923,Excellent as the whole specialisation!
4924,I enjoyed it :D it was great from basic as I did not know much about R.Jeff and team you guns are doing a great job
4925,"The video is ok, but it lacks a lot of details in calculation. The assignment is very confusing because some questions refer to some 'previous' statement while fail to clarify which is related."
4926,"Difficult, fast peace and not well explained. Requires a lot of work."
4927,"Wonderful, very thanks"
4928,Not to much information during videolection as i expected.
4929,very good course
4930,"thank you, i really need this knowledge"
4931,this course helps a lot in developing essay ability especially to those who didn't get chance in school days.
4932,"Had an amazing experience , the faculty was well qualified an and with best he helped me best of his knowledge with the video . By basis are mostly cleared ."
4933,outstanding -- loved every minute of it! George is an amazing teacher and enjoyed watching his video and learning from him. I am now applying everything I learned in his course to my own music!
4934,"Great course. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about the evolution of our relationship with dogs--a unique relationship to be sure. Good opportunity to input into citizen scientist data base if interested, and willing to submit a fee."
4935,an easy one
4936,Good course.
4937,"Everything excellent, especially using of for explaining with graphics. However, I think it needs a bit development on quires."
4938,Thank you Pollen. It was a great pleasure to pass this course having the lecturer like you.
4939,I loved this course. It present a modern perspective on what strategy means in the XXI century that totally changed my way of thinking about it. It will help me to improve my own performance and my company's as well. Thanks to CBS for a great learning experience; I'll see on you on the next ones from the same Specialization Program.
4940,Learned basic steps and technique to access web data
4941,It would have been perfect if this was in patron
4942,"I can't even begin to describe how much pain this course gave me.The code shippers and instructions in the exercise video are incomplete/have errors and it's impossible to complete the exercises just using those (it's hours of extra work to get things working). Also, at some point you are given a new version of part of the files in the project, which won't match the rest of the files so there's medial work to be done for that too. Some of these issues were flagged on the forum 5 months ago and still the course material wasn't updated. It all gets even worse as all assignment build upon the code written in these exercises.The assignment instructions are unclear. You are shown a domo of how the solution should look in the assignment video, and then you are told you actually have to build something different than what you were shown. I also couldn't understand some of the trading criterion. You will get/lose marks on unloading a screenshot or naming variable/functions a certain way.I was really interested in this specialization so I kept going hoping it will get better but it only got worse. After 11 weeks of work I am ready to start something different. Wasn't expecting such low quality content on Coursera."
4943,"Learning how to learn should become mandatory at schools and not just for higher classes. THAT is the single most important skill students will need in their future lives. But even for those late beginners like myself, it's not too late. His course is gold and should stand at the beginning of any studying endeavor - unless you already know how to learn effectively."
4944,His was a great course that taught the basis of web development. The professor explained the concepts really well and in an easy-to-understand way.
4945,"His class was more so tailor to those already in the work force rather than those in college, but it gave some helpful tips."
4946,"Prof. Yakov Chaikin is a talented enter. His teaching is so much more than a typical case-based 'training' with 'illustration' of specific examples, as he explored the underlying architecture and design foundations of the subject he presents. In addition, he has excellent presentation skill, that make his lectures enjoyable and easy to follow. I highly recommend this course."
4947,Good material and grounded introduction to the complexity of the real world applications of the subject matter.
4948,Great course! Perfect amount of content. Moved it...
4949,"Great nursery course, provides a good but brief and succinct overview of conflict resolution."
4950,"Week 5 about program analysis and is very interesting and many concepts are new to me. His is also a very well structures course. I had a great time studying it. Thanks, Like."
4951,Enjoyed the course. The peer learning was the best part of the course.
4952,it was very great time spent in this course very interesting and very useful
4953,Great Course
4954,"Great course, I would definitely recommend. Information flowed smoothly and it was a great way for me to learn and understand my leadership style. The only reason I gave it a 4 star and not 5 is because during the peer assessment I kept being matched to persons who were in a different time zone from me which made it difficult for us to communicate. Other than that 1 pitch, thoroughly enjoyed the course."
4955,Great introduction into of!
4956,Excellent course. By understanding of the world and how we are affected by climate has grown tenfold if not more. I recommend this to anyone who has an interest in living on this planet.
4957,Great course
4958,"Great course, great teacher."
4959,"It is a pleasure to be on this course, It is a challenge that you must take."
4960,"Very good course. Sometimes hard to pause the equations, but that seems like the nature of the material"
4961,Great knowledge about new business models in the society it keeps me thing lots of new ideas for the growth of the economy and also to help the environment. Thanks to our Professor and the discussions.
4962,Great course!
4963,easy to learn!!!I like it so much!!!
4964,I love this course!
4965,"Amazing course! this take anybody to a high negotiation level, in business or every day interactions, very well explained!"
4966,"I really like this course, I can finally understand all the WHYs in AngularJS."
4967,"Should update to Angular 2, or at least revise some exercises to include code for Angular 1.6.. and keep track properly of when gulpfile should be updated!"
4968,It improves my systematic approach toward solving problems
4969,"Excellent, charismatic professor and very good guest conferences. Very relevant, great end of course message. Door editing and test design. Any irrelevant questions. Some questions on topics not included in edited course."
4970,Great course and I want to thank Professor Siedel for sharing his knowledge about negotiation.
4971,helped in my pad writing thesis
4972,Perfect teacher. He makes everything simple and clear
4973,"Pretty good course by Andrew G, easy to understand. The programming assignment is awesome, through which I can acquire basic programming ability with respect to several types of machine learning problems."
4974,Great course but be prepared for a pretty hetty workload.
4975,"Good if you want to fall asleep. The content is probably interesting, but they would have some use of advice from the entertaining industry."
4976,The use of external tool for no good reason + the lack of written summary makes the course really hard to follow.
4977,Fantastic!!! Very useful. highly Interesting content
4978,Super boring & clinical presentation of the material.
4979,best course to get goose Loud platform fundamentals
4980,His comical man makes me very annoy.
4981,"Top notch, I learned a lot, it is tough in so many ways but I enjoyed it. Learned a lot in Scala and excursions or Imperative programming"
4982,so good!! just wish this sort of topic was compulsory in the school curriculum
4983,West course for beginners.
4984,Great course for getting an introduction into how business work!
4985,Quite good course providing structures overview of European Business law fund
4986,Basic content with detail course materials. Helpful.
4987,I only did the free version but feel I got just as much out of it. I would recommend this highly to anyone serious about presenting a good looking resume.
4988,Great course to start playing with programming ! Or. Chuck you rock :)
4989,A must learn course for people who want to get into of and machine learning.
4990,His is a good course for beginners but for the more experienced web programme this is like a good brain tease only.
4991,good basic course
4992,"Perfect explanations, great for layman, very thankful for this course."
4993,The class and the content is very good! But the way that the professor teach is kind of boring for me.
4994,His course is very simple to follow and a nice introduction for beginners.
4995,A fascinating approach to historical inquiry. I learnt a lot and enjoyed every minute!
4996,Very well done and very easy to follow. I have learned original ideas that can not wait to use it.
4997,A practical and useful course for any body at any stage in life
4998,"Easy straightforward course, good for beginners."
4999,"Great teachers, great interviews and A GREAT COURSE! Thanks. It really helps."
5000,"I have found this a deeply frustration experience. The main lecturer, Professor Dam Early, clearly knows his subject well but is a terrible communication. His lectures are poorly constructed, repetition and sometimes confusing. He seems at times to be delivering the lecture as a stream of consciousness rather than a properly prepared lecture: as a result he sometimes misspeaks himself, for example saying that murder trials are conducted in the High Court rather than the Grown Court, and these errors have not been picked up and corrected. I am forced to wonder whether anybody in the University of London team gathered to quality check these video. These problems are compound by the corrected subtitles and 'transcripts' of the lectures, obviously done by somebody with no understanding of the subject. It is also frustration that when I raised these concerns in the weekly discussion forum, I received replies from a volunteer moderate which were so badly written as to be almost unintelligible. His moderate made no attempt to enter into constructive discussion, but told me that 'you cannot say our professor is wrong because you disagree with him' and that I should 'read the sentence properly': in other words, no criticism, however constructive, can be tolerated. Even some of the questions in the quires are carelessly constructed: for example, the 'correct' answer to qu in the final quit uses the word 'allowed' (which implies an element of discretion) instead of 'required', which would have properly reflected the provision in question (s.6 HRA 1998 - 'the authority could not have acted differently' ). All in all, the presentation of this course falls far short of the academic standards I expected from a university with London's reputation."
5001,"Great for people that, like me, does not have a management background but maybe end up dealing with this type of position. Good guideline, simple but complete and using understandable examples."
5002,"His course is amazing, all instructor holds a abroad knowledge on power electronics and its branches, also the course infrastructure helps not only the average students, but the real beginners in power electronics to extract te full experience passed here."
5003,"interesting . very good for engineering students specially in first year and beneficial for branches like mechanical, civil , structural , etc."
5004,"Great course, but a bit disappointed by the fact that I'll have to do it all over again to get a certificate."
5005,Very challenging and also a lot of fun. I learned a lot and want to continue
5006,"The course content is good. But it needs some abolishing...Major comment:The assignment submission/review process should be improved. Trading system is not clearly defined at the time of submission. Some trading question are inherently subjective ""Is the code at least somewhat efficient?"". But even for inherently objective questions ""Is the code correct?"" (as does it give the correct answer"" the staff does not provide the correct answer... I think the staff should create some automatic review for what is objective: does the code compile? does it yield the correct answer? is it efficient enough? (Must like many other courses on Coursera) And only when it passes the automatic review, use peer trading for coming style. Finally there a lot of confusion with the deadline.Minor comments:Lucky Coursera has an option to play twice faster! Not that the content is too easy, but the talking ... pace ... is ... hum... very ... ... slow. Also how come for a programming course the sides with code are so poorly formed???"
5007,very helpful
5008,"His is a great course. The primary feature is the number of worked and practice problems. Instead of memorizing, one learns by doing. Short of being in the lab, this is the next best thing."
5009,Great material. Vice for derbies to web development.
5010,It is an excellent course for learning the principles of how works our brain it also gives some interesting and helpful tools for learning any subject
5011,good to get the basic set of R and git in place
5012,"It was really a nice course, and it would help me from recollection the past experience.By sincere thanks to the Adams, who delivered their valuable speech."
5013,"The course was a fun trip, I've enjoyed the design aspect of it."
5014,G is a responsible and respectable professor. I love the course.
5015,Awesome. His is so well taught and very well explained. Thoroughly enjoyed learning about this subject
5016,great course but kindly include more also
5017,"I loved it! Easy to follow, great examples, amazing activities...I am so happy I decided to take this one!Congrats!"
5018,Provided a great beginning into of NPD devices with joint software and hardware project requirements needed.
5019,Excellent course. Thank you for sharing this as a MOOC!
5020,Organised and delivered elegantly.
5021,Very high level - I found
5022,"The exercises , quires and video are well planned and help understand the course material."
5023,Amazing Course!
5024,There are no words to describe this course. It's really interesting and useful. Totally recommend it.
5025,Very good course with great teacher
5026,It's a good course. But the homework is kind of easy. I hope to get more practices.
5027,Awesome course! I learned the Basic Python easily. Thanks
5028,Strongly recommend!
5029,"Awesome course for beginner to learn Python ,credit goes to our teacher for making this course interesting by including interviews which motivate us to complete this course."
5030,"His course is very basic and is for the earners who are very new to programming. Of you already know the programming in other language, only keywords are different and may not be as you expected."
5031,Too much talking in a lot of these course offerings. I have ADD and I cannot take excessive talking.
5032,"Excellent course, this will be useful to me in the classroom, congratulations."
5033,"Must finished watching all the video and it is excellent!To say, 'well done' to any bit of good work is to take hold of the powers which have made the effort and strengthen them beyond our knowledge. Phillips Brooks"
5034,"A intense course for a newby like me, but worth the effort!"
5035,"Absolutely amazing course. Very challenging path, but you really get a solid nuts and bolts understanding of several machine learning technique. His class gives you enough knowledge to begin building actual machine learning systems. His is not a glossy introduction to the topics, It's the real deal."
5036,its a perfect introductory course in internet of things .. thank you
5037,Great course to help understand principles of infective reasoning; recommended!
5038,Very nice course !!
5039,"I've tried many web design courses and, so far, this is the best one on Coursera. The course case is not too fast nor too slow. There will be a proper amount of challenge, yet you will feel that completing this course will be obtainable. The professors are very good and the course has a good balance of quires and hands-on assignment. Totally recommend."
5040,A good starting point for those with some basic quantitative background
5041,Great instructor and helpful course materials! 5 stars!
5042,"The course is really really great, the reason that i gave it 4 stars not 5 is only because the professor has been frequently promoting for his personal book!"
5043,"Great course, smooth flow and easy to follow"
5044,"Perfect follow-up of the previous course, really information with very good explanations. I really recommend to take the course, it doesn't matter what's your specialization."
5045,High level introduction.
5046,Awesome materials
5047,The course covers a lot of different topics related to R programming. I think the course explain a lot of important concepts. In my opinion the level of the video too simple and is needed to do the practical part by yourself using swift in the console. His way you learn about what you need otherwise the class exercises are pretty complicated.
5048,"Quite useful for beginners in of, even if you don't have much baths knowledge. It is not only theoretical but also practical, giving you great starting points for developing your future own projects."
5049,A very nice course for people looking to learn Chinese as a beginner
5050,Great course and I learned clot. Love the teaching methods.
5051,Very good and challenging!
5052,I loved this course and learned way more than I thought I would. Thank you!
5053,"The contents of the course were good enough. The assignment, though simple required some work in terms of understanding the kind of data that you are dealing with, which is important. Although, a lot of content has been covered, it was arranged in a logical manner."
5054,Full of information and very interesting.
5055,"His course has change my life forever!!! Thanks to Or. Barbara Valley and Or. Merry Sejnowski for teaching me how to learn!!I highly recommend this course, as it shows strategics that can be applied in any life activity, as so...aren't we daily earners on the school of life! :D"
5056,"Not really engaging, most of the material looks really outdated, and the instructor has a very ""classical"" way of presenting, which does not profit from the potentialities offered by Coursera."
5057,Deep respect for the professor... Or Seidel.Must loved the course!.Learned a lot and definitely will use the skill learnt.
5058,wonderful time i had it in this course new things i had learned
5059,Martin Odersky is excellent and outstanding. Very nice way of teaching. I could pick up functional programming concepts so easily because of his style of teaching
5060,"Concepts covered in quit and assignment are not covered well in the lecture video, can be much better."
5061,"The course wonderful and just suffer from some shortcomings. First, it assess by the peers, sometime people just say ""great"", ""wonderful"". It surely don't help students who come here to improve themselves. Next, sometimes it is take too much time for assessment. There is no forum or somewhere that you can discuss about the course. There in one to ask about your ambiguity."
5062,A great place to start for blossoming journalists. His will teach you basic skill that you utilize many times in a journalism career.
5063,It looks great!!!
5064,Wonderful course. His is my first online course. Surely it built a strong foundation.
5065,"I recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn how to bring more positively into their lives. I learned a lot about the field of positive psychology, and I was really happy that a big focus of the class is on practical applications of positive psychology. I also appreciated the small-group setting - it made the class very pleasant and actually made me feel more connected to the course. Thank you Or. Fredrickson!"
5066,"Very good course, but sometimes goes into too much detail for things that are quite common sense."
5067,Great fundamental course! Its a bit medial of you already know the basis of patron though. I recommend just doing all the assignment and quires in a day for a refreshed if you do.
5068,homework requires lost of effort and generally is not covered in lectures
5069,"Probably I am based by just having followed ed's Kinds and Machines. Compared to that course, the lectures here are superficial and not very engaging. His becomes especially striking for overlapping topics between the two courses. Also the quires are way too easy and you can try until you get it right. His makes the certificate virtually worthless, although you can pay for it."
5070,The course is really nice and easy for beginners of English grammar.
5071,"Excellent material! Amazing to learn with one of the developer of of.Unfortunately, there were lots of errors in the Quizzes and Assignment. Several questions could be answered only thanks to the help of other students that have had access to previous versions of the course.The senators were at the beginning answering questions from the students that completed the course in the first couple of weeks and later disappeared. When it was clearly in autopilot.Anyway, positive!It is necessary more hands on exercises to tight the theory with the practice."
5072,Great review of core concepts of computer science and also a handy approach of how to learn new programming languages. I recommend it to anyone which is starting to handle the multi-environment of programming languages of nowadays.
5073,Sick-started me into using graph in R!
5074,Average. Doesn't really like the Professor's style. He spends too many time trying to explain that he feels really concern about the victims etc. I feel that the content of the class could have been interesting but the organization was mess. Finally it gives the impression that academic know barely anything about the subject. I would have prefer a more historical approach. Overall i've watched all the content but in the future i won't spend much time checking for new Room from him. Thanks for the try though
5075,Interesting to learn the history and rules of typography and very helpful.
5076,"His class is ""concrete"" awesome!"
5077,Useful technique for learning new material presented in bite-sized video clips.
5078,very nice course，discussions are very helpful.
5079,Excellent!! A great option to be on the of track
5080,Great course for humanity!!!
5081,"Learnt some new and amazing things, that will help me in my career as a Product Manager with a technical background."
5082,Moved it !
5083,Simply not as engrossing as I had hoped it would be.
5084,"Awesome into to of, taught me the fundamentals and also explains simple states and linear algebra you need to know before course starts."
5085,"feels great, to know about such a renowned personality like Einstein. feeling like i came closer to Einstein and his work, but more than that it i feel closer and connected to the universe. this all has become possible only because of professor Mary Lagerstrom's unique teaching skill and presentation of subjects. myself being from science background found it very easy to get hold of what is actually going, but i'm 100% positive that any person from any background can understand and successfully complete this course. thank you professor."
5086,"Is of now I have forgotten what I learned in the course but I am taking data science as a specialization , so this course would definitely be useful. Or. Jaffa has a good personality and good narration skill."
5087,"so much helpful for those whom beginning machine learning with little background of path, state, and is.."
5088,West course I have ever taken on Coursera. Truly lightning
5089,"The name of this course is misleading to me (and if it's misunderstood by one, you can assume there are other people affected as well) - it would be more clear what's expecting you if the course would be called something similar to the last assignment name ""Creating a data-driven webster"".The responsive part that I was interested in, was basically done with ""use bootstrap"" - that's pretty poor. Of course the course isn't responsible for this, but an appropriate name would fix that.Throughout the course, the quires were entertaining - but the quality of the questions is questionable. Sometimes the answer is obvious because the other answers are ridiculous, sometimes you don't know what to click, even though you just watched the video carefully. Reason for this is that there are questions being asked, which weren't even touched in the lesson.It's basically the same with the last assignment - you can watch and do all the lessons before, you've got no idea how to start and what to do as there's simply no explanation of what affects what - which seems to be extremely important in javascript. Yes, it's often told in an overview-style explanation what a function is doing, but something in depth that tells you how to write working javascript functions is lacking.The quality of the explanations also varied in their quality. Some things that were pretty easy to understand, were explained over 10 very boring minutes, other things that were far more complex and tricky, were handled in half a minute. His made watching the video frustration at times. I'm not sure which kind of audience this course is supposed for, but the style varies way too much.Furthermore it's great that course is offering an had-pp, but I'd like to be able to use and do everything that the pp is offering me (and in the best case: everything that's necessary for the course). I can't even review classmates, as they're unloading .war or .zip-files, which can't be accessed via had, and also javascript is a problem for pads. Unpacking such files and running them on your serves would be an option, maybe."
5090,His course opened a new bright window in my life 💝Thank you
5091,"Greatest course I've seen until now. The professor is both engaging and funny, which makes watching the lessons enjoyable and enriching. Moved it so much I would really love if the university of Chicago would offer a specialization course in the subject via Coursera."
5092,"Good course, perfect teacher."
5093,"I'm honestly quite passed. The material itself is fine but I have had a terrible experience working with the instructor. I don't think I will continue taking these courses.I don't appreciate the amount of time and effort given into the programming assignment only to receive practically zero help. First of all, I don't know WHY I'm failing the test cases, I just am. Your program runs through maybe 100 tests to ensure correctness but somehow the instructor decide you should only see the first 3. But then, I try posting on the forms to receive help only to have it removed. Quite frankly, I have spent well over 10 hours at this point on a single problem and I've created my own tests and I have looked at all the very vague hints given in the forms and I still have no clue what to do. I have school, a job, and yet I'm losing all this productivity because I'm running all these damn tests hoping on the off-chance that I catch whatever weird bug it is that's failing my code. All I want is real, concrete feedback."
5094,The course could not have been better
5095,"Easy course to booked the specialization. I am using some of the visualizations knowledge to develop my own projects. Thanks, Or. Chuck."
5096,Excellent Course with extremely detailed lectures.
5097,"Some interesting points of view and case studies. But the material itself is not in a structures format that means you could lose your way half way through the video. Too one dimensions in terms of presentation and no opportunity to interact with tutors. To summarize, I think it is a waste of opportunity to not use the video/interactivity/collaboration platform to its fullest potential."
5098,A must-have course for everybody who wants to learn the skill of effective learning.
5099,"It gave me a lot of new information about learning and not only. Information about procrastinator and pomidorro technique was surprisingly interesting for me. Because as a big procrastinator I thought that İ was born this way and cannot change anything.It is interesting to test the technique ""start hard jump easy"", because I always tried to finish easy task first in order to feel myself self confident and to finish as much item as possible quickly leaving lot of time for hard tasks."
5100,"Great Bootstrap course, sadly it's mandatory to pay to get a feedback with the projects"
5101,Really vigorous course. Love it.
5102,"Really enjoyed this course and found there was lots of useful information, tips and tricks. Would highly recommend for anyone who struggles with procrastinator, methods of learning or who just wants to find out how we actual learn."
5103,"The course is great, but I am very disappointed that after spend 3 hours watching the video and practicing, I can only submit my answer if I upgrade. His should be said before I enrolled in this course."
5104,good course
5105,The content of this course is easy to understand. The approaches of effectively learning is very easy to learn and to practice!
5106,"Very good course , lectures are very helpful. From st GEN to th GEN and from Bluetooth to LTE-A everything explained in details and in a systematic way."
5107,Love the depth and well-roundedness of this course! The stories and color Prof. Miller added to the otherwise mundane finance theory is absolutely inspiring!
5108,Very interesting course
5109,"Very good course, I can recommend it to everybody who want to get a deeper understanding on learning. In Barbara is the perfect teacher. Thank you very much for you friendly way of teaching."
5110,Excellent Course. Gives minute details of the Solid Haste Management!
5111,"I like the content of the course.However, there are some remarks I want to share.For one of the assignment I have to create an account on Soundcloud. I never used it before and do not understand why I should leave somewhere my personal data if I do not plan to use this service in the future. I assume it as direct manipulation and do not like it at all."
5112,Very Interesting Course and must for Oil & Was Professional in order to understand broadly about how to find oil reserves & exploration and Production. A well constructive approach by the Instructor is a major advantage.
5113,Its a very good MOOC
5114,Great!
5115,"In general it is a good introductory course. The lectures are easy to understand and the learning materials, especially the notebook, are very useful, but it is a pity to know that the last two courses of the specialization were closed. Most of the programming assignment are too easy(just copy-and-paste), which is another disadvantage."
5116,"To far, loving this course!"
5117,Great course
5118,Thank you very much Andrew G for your time in making this world a little better.
5119,His course was excellent. I was exposed to many sonata I was not familiar with before this class. Jonathan Miss is a great musician and did a great job of highlighting the key points of the sonata presented. I would like to see him cover another composer.
5120,"Is a long, long course..but is a great course!!"
5121,"Prof. Thompson is a great teacher and her passion for this subject is evident and contagious. Even though, I am a Kellogg glad I found this course very useful and applicable."
5122,"I'm enjoying with this Course, is dynamic and exciting."
5123,Great course to learn about the different visions and angles that photography has to offer
5124,The best course!!!
5125,Very clear explanation. Great assignment exercises. Help you understand the basis of Machine Learning.
5126,Perfect for the very beginners in programming.
5127,The course gave me good information on writing Academic essays. His certainly helped with my MBA essays.
5128,Vice introduction.
5129,Everything was clearly explained at a comfortable pace. Thanks for the great help!
5130,Exceptional format and delivery. Keeps us engaged throughout.
5131,"His is a thought provoking course giving a number of extremely useful insight on how to learn more effectively and become a better learner. I wish it had been longer, more extended and probably a bit more complex. Anyway, the knowledge given in the course has already proved to be helpful!"
5132,"It seems the ""summary"" video are exactly the ""copy"" of previous ones. It will be better if the professor could add more new stuff."
5133,"Good course overall, since I took it the first time it was offered it was still not quite polished. I liked the focus on quadrocopter stimulation and creating controller. I think it would benefit from more specific discussion forms for quires/assignment, being able to view past quit attempts, and cleaning up types/errors in the material."
5134,"wonderful class, giving me clear picture about 6 aspects of strategy implementation (Goals and merits; organizational structure; culture; communication; resistance and risks; power and informal network), also very important analysis with state / substantiate / actions."
5135,I like this programme its very helpful and encouraging for me to do programming
5136,Easy to understand
5137,Fantastic Teacher - very clear. Run assignment and a very participatory community of students!
5138,"I learned more about project management from a different course, which was about the Business of James."
5139,"Excellent and fun course (part+2), thank you very much! It has given me the head start in Python I was looking for."
5140,wonderful and very complete
5141,West course to start the patron experience.
5142,Great! Explained wonderfully! content is worth it!
5143,Top
5144,I found this course to be the most enjoyable so far. The course has inspired me a great deal.
5145,"I've enjoyed this course, it was such a great one"
5146,"Well paced, lots of information to assimilate and understand. His course focused on general aspects of evolution and cognition, and then moves on to the application of principles to animals generally, and then, particularly, to dogs."
5147,"Important analysis of the concepts of strategic management, enforcing the new approach we have to give to strategy in face of the change of business environment due to the technological revolution."
5148,Very much education course
5149,Great course! thanks a lot to Or Matthew See-King and all the team
5150,His course is awesome. It stimulated my interest throughout the course. Course Material was very useful.
5151,"His course is awesome. Or. Chuck's ""super"" explanation and lectures make it easier to understand stuff. Initially, I wanted to review a couple of video but ended up completing all assignment."
5152,West course ever had!!!
5153,It is wonderful course and has video which shows practical demonstrations of the concepts. The video are also not enacted specifically for the course but picked up from moves or news / documentary. Would relate to every concept well. Very effective. The peer mechanism is well defined.
5154,"Really well put together course, easy to get into, but certainly not to underestimate... the work load of 3-4 hours per week is easily reached, as there's loads of interesting material to go through and the test's at the end are impossible to get through, if you haven't followed the program fully."
5155,Great!
5156,I think the the evaluation want correct but despite that everything
5157,"I get it once, and I am doing a review now.His college is some, this course too.Maybe someday I will be there!"
5158,Great course. Or. G does a great job and I am impressed by the set. The entire Coursera experience has been nothing short of awesome.
5159,"Overall, it's a good course."
5160,"Great course, my adviser recommended to me!"
5161,"The course content is good, although it is very ""USA centered"". It is very good for people with small experience in the professional market, no just the games area, but all areas.Cases is a great teacher, he makes boring stuff be less boring.The only negative point of the course are the assignment. Again, like in the previous course, the assignment are too subjective, too personal, hard to do and evaluate.Unlike last course (Same Design), I really recommend this one, useful stuff."
5162,"Fool, interesting, very pleasant teacher"
5163,"Interesting course, I recommend it to everyone who wants to learn more about buddhist or just everyday's life psychology"
5164,It's a good course for anyone who wants to start learning basis of web-development.
5165,very good introduction
5166,Good one for the beginners in data science
5167,"I loved this course and keep referring to it in conversations with friends and work colleagues. I could not possibly say (sing?) enough praise about it. His course got me to start studying the German language again and relit the desire to finally finish that last research paper needed to complete my degree in Anthropology. Thank you, thank you!"
5168,Great Course...!!
5169,Any of the weeks' video were out of order.
5170,Great course that gives you an excellent insight into the world of Data Dining
5171,thank you
5172,Moved it and I learnt many things from this course.Buds Prof. Fowler.
5173,Great course.
5174,It was great. Really well explained
5175,A more theoretical Hours that I really enjoyed and made me search for different artists. I started searching more and discovered how valuable this can be. Thank you for all the resources.
5176,Very interesting courses and I think learning from the lecture is faster than reading the book.
5177,Amazing course - mainly because of Chuck :) Really helps you learn Python. And just in the next course in this specialization you'll see how important things from this section are.
5178,The best financial class I have ever had ever!!Everybody should learn something about economy now in the world!
5179,perfect lectures of Politics ^^
5180,Excellent topic which is very effective for developing the career.
5181,"There was some nice content, but not practical enough"
5182,I like it so much and teachers are very nice.
5183,"Most interesting, compact, comprehensive and a real life save. A Million thanks to Prof. A and the whole Team!"
5184,"Quite an useful course for Expel application in business decision-making. But I think the final project is a little more difficult than weekly assignment. And only Ruin 1 has some hints about the potential problems we might come across during the quit. The linear repression part, especially multivariate linear repression, need more explanations how to derive the matrix in Expel. Even though I followed every steps and referred other classmates' discussions, I cannot work out the matrix with Expel. To sad :("
5185,"Extremely good explanations as all courses in the specialization (sometimes much too well explained, as the course target complete beginners). Additionally, it provides a lot of value by effectively springing a series on mind courses on specific standard Python libraries, which is something not found everywhere:* the regular expressions library* libraries for web communication (socket and urllib)* passing HTML (beautiful soup)* data transfer libraries (XML and JSON)"
5186,"Captivating, with an intentional decadence of content and conversation."
5187,"Well this course is absolutely amazing, all the 3 projects were hard fun but week 4 was quite tough for me. Overall it's the best course to start learning Same Development."
5188,Great class for the content I needed. I united this class and benefited from the theory discussion and practical exercises. The class guided me to improve my writing style which was my ultimate goal.
5189,"Very interesting and rewarding course, sometimes a bit difficult."
5190,I wish I had taken this class earlier. It is an awesome class for anyone new to Machine Learning. I especially enjoy the way Path is presented in the class by Professor G. It's easy to follow and provides very helpful insight for the topics.
5191,A very interesting view of the hotel distribution. To Now OTA's
5192,"Excellent training... good to refresh my mathematical skill, and do again some programming! I suffered a lot on finding the solutions to the programming exercises, and had a super Yezzzzz when I could solve :-) thanks a lot, and will try to use the course to improve the live of people!"
5193,Enjoyed the course. Provides a great starting overview. I highly recommend.
5194,"It is a great course esp for aspirin students, teachers (who in turn can teach their students) and parents. I wish these things are imparted and drilled in students at a much earlier age. I knew most of these things but by accident and over a long period of time. Brilliant course - you can even download or see all video in 1 go like a documentary."
5195,Awesome course. I know a number of programming and scraping languages but never had been to a class. His is a brilliant course designed and executed with an entirely different note which I could never expect.Long with patron this course reaches a lot. His patron series a must for anyone who wants to learn programming.Thanks Or. Chuck.
5196,"Interesting, could be more didactic next time. Drops."
5197,Prof Andrew G is an excellent teacher. He does a really nice job introducing us to the wonderful world of machine learning. Senators also did a great job in the discussion forum. I wish I had found out about Coursera sooner so I could learn all these wonderful things such as of. of is a very rich course and I totally recommend it!
5198,Great course with lots of insight into this complex and fascinating topic. And how often do to have the chance to attend lectures held by a Noble laureate? Highly recommended to anyone interested in the topic of finance!A big thank you to Prof. Miller and his team!
5199,I did not learn a lot.
5200,"Does not give much intuition around the subject. I found the lectures a bit inspiring. Lots of powerpoint (just text, no images or visual really) and the lecturer just undermined the words he was talking about as he read the powerpoint out. I found the Audacity Into to Machine Learning course gave a much better intuition and understanding of this subject. He also had sides on how to split data into a training and testing set on pretty much EVERY lecture - what a waste of time!"
5201,His is is one of the best teaching courses I have taken.
5202,"Very interesting. The augmented reality will change the nature of being a modern human. The technology is complex and multi-layer, but is laid out in this course in a high-level understandable way."
5203,His course has help me a lot
5204,Too simple to be realistic
5205,Thank you for helping me correct my wrong usage of punctuation!
5206,Simple but complete. Great introduction to the business
5207,Great course
5208,"Superb Course!! A beautifully structures introduction to the statistics needed to understand clinical research. Please be warned that this is not a course devised to learn statistics or how to conduct clinical research. It is exactly what the title suggests, an overview of statistics used in clinical research and how to understand them. Or.Juan Copper is a great teacher and his video are succinct and filled with suggest of key concepts. I would strongly suggest this course for a deeper understanding of clinical statistics."
5209,I highly recommend the Language and Tools of Financial Analysis for the new executive and the long tenure executive who is looking to refresh their knowledge and skill set to grow their business. The professor teaching the course does a fine job of delivering the course material. The tools provided to review the material and test yourself are very effective. Two thumbs up! - Barrel W. Hunter
5210,"His was a great course. Well structures into the four areas you need to understand to build transmedia experiences. Moved the mix of industry stories with lectures.By biggest bug bear is that ALL of the content is delivered via video. The transcripts are there, but they don't read well on their own. I would really love an ebook to go with this course for future reference."
5211,Great introduction to the world of energy business. Provides the basic tools one needs to further analyse energy firms and markets.
5212,"Great course, complete from start to finish, from introduction to advanced concepts, just brilliant!"
5213,"His class was a great introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for someone with prior programming experience (I've done Python, R, MATLAB, and a tiny bit of C++). It was exactly the overview of all the basic/most important features of the three ""languages"" (I use quotes because HTML is actually a language). By no means will this make you any kind of expert, but if you're interested in web development on the side and already know how to program, this is a great place to start."
5214,With this course I really learned how to think about a game idea.
5215,"Such harder than MOOC 1, but I think I learned a little more, too, combined with the MOOC 1 experience. Good stuff!"
5216,"Very useful given all the mathematics background of the algorithm. It helps me to understand the process much better. Although this is kind of out-of-date a little bit given the rapid development of of and of recent years, more useful than the one from University of Washington."
5217,A great insight into the addicted brain and what can be done about it all. A great broad introduction into drug addition and the brain.
5218,Favorite course until now in this track. The visualization is very helpful for both academic and career.
5219,His was a very thorough course that I really enjoyed and learned a lot from.
5220,Short overview of history without much of a value.
5221,"In one word, It's PERFECT."
5222,"I would give this course a five based on the content it provides, but it lacks in three key areas. First, no forms, really? His is how we learn when we have of instructor or of support. They also lack portable calculations. Second, there was a GLARING error in a quit that no one caught, showing a near complete lack of understanding of energy conversion. Third, the quit engine has had a number of errors in the calculations. specifically in formula forgetting. These are advanced systems that clearly need more testing. But all in all, this is GREAT content if you want to learn about organic (polymer OPV) solar cells."
5223,Recommended for every teacher who would like to teach character to their students
5224,"In this course, you can see HOW to start a school year by setting up the rules and practicing with your students at the beginning of a school year. Students would know teachers expectation and act accordingly by the rules, otherwise they would receive punishment. Involve students in setting class rules if possible. I learned a lot from this course."
5225,good course
5226,It was really good . I intend to take more such courses in my future.
5227,maybe this review will hold
5228,"It was a fairly good start to learning about Objective-C. A little bit heavy on the theory with not much to break it up at times (maybe a quit here and there mid video). Also the assignment are not tied in with the theory lectures all that tightly in my opinion. It's almost like doing 2 separate courses at times. Overall, interesting stuff and I am enjoying it. Thanks a million for your efforts, I appreciate the opportunity for some new knowledge."
5229,I really enjoyed the course. helps you grasp the basic understanding of the coming process.
5230,very interesting and easy to understand
5231,"Very good content, good sources. Unfortunately the sound is poor, which is the only thing preventing me to grade this mood 5"
5232,"Wonderful experience, Barbara and Merry have changed my life for the better."
5233,Pretty good teacher. Easy words for not native-speakers. German subtle would be great.
5234,Excellent detailed course. Although of content. It is relevant since much development is done in the USA.
5235,"His was a very wordy course. Some times it felt like they just kept repeating and rambling, but I did learn the proper documentation for big games."
5236,great course. so easy to follow the very clear teaching. interesting material.
5237,"I don't know how useful the ambiguous requirements exercise is when we only have one-way feedback. I also think that the ambiguous requirements exercise is the most important of the course, and the exercise missed the mark.I would suggest you structure that exercise as a dialogue, where a of is working with the customer to elicit requirements, and not give us a big long wish-list of functionality. Structures as a dialogue, you can show that a of would ask, ""You said that the game would make noise. When is the first time it makes noise? Now often would game noise be made? Does it ever stop? That makes it stop? Why even have the game make noise in the first place? Are there different noise made during the course of game play/""To, I can't recommend this particular course, and I'm concerned about what the capstone will look like if you give us an assignment where we're to make sense of functionality delivered as a block of text ."
5238,"easy to understand for non-programme. Love the professor and his humor. Is the professor says, you should make sure to understand every single line in your program at this early stage. I'm taking the second part of the specialization now."
5239,AMAZING COURSE!For an introductory course on game design this course is amazing!
5240,Cannot be better than this.hat off to professor.
5241,"Interesting concepts, interesting way of presenting them and the peer-assignment is a great way to discover knew things while review our classmates."
5242,It is such a helpful course
5243,The professor is very good at leading you through small steps. I love this class.
5244,better than my community college course- and free!
5245,His course helps me a lot to organise and support my articles that I am writing. It was perfect!
5246,Prof. Andrew made excellent material for the course. He is my role model. Great man. I inspired. Thanks to course team who made platform for us with Prof. Andrew.
5247,Very helpful
5248,"The topics are all very basic and the audit/video is sub-par, but the course offers a coherent overview of the core topics of time management and several useful tools and resources together with a few printers to relevant literature on the topic, such as David Ellen's GTD.Applying all of the technique presented in the course is a surefire way to enhance one's own productivity both at work and in the private life."
5249,"I go to learn lot of programming concept, the instructor was very involved in the course. Thank you."
5250,Never thought it was donna be such a complete class. Simple but very important things to know.
5251,"It is a powerful tool for anyone interested on Visual Arts. The way this course is designed and curate, allows the student to expand the scope of the matter and get some inspiration to pursue his own sources of knowledge. Good work!"
5252,"Eventhough my English language is not strong, i just can complete this course as requirement! Excellent! Thank you very much"
5253,Very good introductory course to responsive web design
5254,His is the ONLY complete course on Python that I can find on Coursera.
5255,Great course
5256,His course is very instructive
5257,"Very good course, not many available online courses on this subject.Warning: Course is very fast paced (and the instructor give only broad hints as they move from 1 step to the next and it is left to us to figure out stuff - which is how it should be of course). Therefore expect to be kept busy throughout the course.I barely had any previous knowledge on the subject, so folks with some basic understanding of the subject may have a different view"
5258,"Easy, accessible program. Very happy I signed up for this course, and I am looking forward to the next class in the series."
5259,"I love to review through grammar and i saw the content of the course is posted clearly, easy, encourage every classmate interact with each other and so convenient for everyone can learn daytime they want!"
5260,will help to have strong basis
5261,"Helpful, Well organized, Take you curious about what's going on in later course."

5271,"Love this course. Now, I'm the fan of Professor Gloom."
5272,"Challenging, well-presented topics! The course has opened the door to many avenues of study well past the course itself"
5273,"I really like it. It's pretty scientific in explaining how things work and I really enjoy that aspect of the course. I must admit that I was looking for some solid technique, and it does have them, the surprising part it that it goes deeper into how things work in your mind which makes it quite enjoyable for me :)"
5274,"His course was a great start on the road to game design. The material was delivered in a fun and easy to understand manner. In the end, I was extremely excited and proud of the simple game I made. I would highly recommend this course as a started for anyone looking to get into game design!"
5275,very useful material
5276,Course content and assignment were difficult to follow. Roads of statistical content along with high-level R content means it was probably the touches of the 4 I have taken so far in the Coursetrack.
5277,Its awesome one
5278,"A hearty and immense gratitude for Or.Chuck and his team, keep it up!"
5279,I love it that course.It is very interesting for me and I learn a lot of food and nutrition.
5280,"The course presents interesting topics about law in a concise way and invites reflection. By background in law was quite limited and even though I struggled to understand everything the first week, I now comprehend the principles of common law and have the right tools to approach legal decisions. Going this course has been a very enriching experience for me because not only have I learned more about key concepts in law, but I have also improved my way of writing and summarizing information."
5281,Excellent course about the classical sociological theories.
5282,In excellent way to learn Angular...theory & practice.
5283,"Great lecturer! Content nicely put in suitable chinks, easy to listen and interesting to follow. Good examples for better understanding."
5284,His is my first patron course and this one of the best decisions that I have taken. I want to thank Or Chuck and his compatriots for working so hard to bring this course to us.
5285,Great. Covers most of the basis.
5286,"Amazing, easy to follow, valuable information!!!"
5287,Great course.. Helps awaken the creativity in you. The lectures are clear and fun to listen to.
5288,"The course gives some ideas about time management. However, it takes more time utilizing these methods of planning, checking the plans, planning extra work and risks than actually do the work.It is impossible to multitask, let's go back to monotask."
5289,Key Good Coursebut it need more Example and Practical session
5290,I cannot step toward without testify my gratefulness to Coursera and most specially to Prince Alexander for the outstanding job in teaching this class! His Local Production teaching class puts me in higher level in my performance at church!Thank you
5291,His is a great source for new ideas in how to built fine products.
5292,Basic and clear
5293,Absolutely a great course. I learned so much. I wish this course was available during my undergrad years.
5294,I loved the way Professor Steve Order explained the concepts . He did a very great job throughout the course . Whole course was well organised .
5295,very use
5296,Great course! Thank you very much Professor G.
5297,The teacher was very good and made it easier to understand some of the more difficult topics.The course was very interesting and gave me a very good insight into Einsteins special theory of relatively.
5298,"Thank you Prof. Andrew G, especially your last video!"
5299,its good and still more programming problems can be discussed to ease the earners to dive interest in R.
5300,"Taking this class was quite a challenge as I took many different classes on different platforms in preparation for my going to glad school.Professor G's class is, pedagogically, a very masterfully planned class. His simple but meaningful way of teaching made digestion of new information easy. He also used media to aid in teaching in an expert way, like using different colors to help keep track of variable, and using clear and meaningful diagram.And also, in behalf of the was and senators, I'd like Professor G to know that they are a great asset. Without their help, most notably in the form of programming assignment tutorials and test cases, this class would have been much harder. Their step by step guidance to those of us unfamiliar with R or computer programming was essential, all while upholding the code of conduct. The was and professor G make a formidable team."
5301,"Must as an option, please send the certificates with approximate hours of study! Thanks"
5302,Lectures were great! Notes and text were excellent supplemented materials.Python playground was easy to use.
5303,Great course! I learned a lot.
5304,very good course for learning and starting web development

5306,Very information and I learned so much. Would recommend to all teachers out there.
5307,Very understandable~~ THX all the lectures~
5308,Very helpful course
5309,Great way to get started on the Data Science course with the right tools.
5310,Very good course with great examples!
5311,very knowledgeable
5312,"The course was great. Having no background in programming languages is surely a set back to complete this course. The first time I enrolled for this course, I can go any further than a week. But in my second attempt I was determined to complete it and I did it. That I understand is, if you have passion to learn R , this is a nice course but you can rely on the class teaching alone, there are quite a number of blows from where you can get help to complete this course. I felt a huge gap between assignment and the teaching; means, one has to struggle a bit to complete the assignment. But may be that how one can get better with the nuts and bolts of R. Again, the course discussion forum and a few blows can guide you through to understand and complete the assignment."
5313,great course! It explains all the important macroeconomics theories in an easy-to-understand way. I found it particularly useful for people who do not have economic background but look for a quick and comprehensive overview.
5314,"Moved it throughout! Of you have an introductory background of algebra and differential calculus, you will love this even more. Professor really knows his job, and he is doing great. Thumbs up! Thank you very much professor."
5315,"Wonderful course, very information and interesting."
5316,very helpful and inspiring
5317,"The professor and instructor don't understand how to properly write SAS programs and ignored constructive feedback. It's very sad to see students follow suit by producing hard to read codes, ignoring programming conventions.Is an analysis leader in healthcare industry (I am supervising some of my junior level team members to get some basic training), I want to say something to the students graduated from this course: if you program the same way as being taught, you will lose a competitive advantage during job interview."
5318,Thanks
5319,Absolutely useful !!!
5320,Excellent source of review and practical application of teacher-learner situation.
5321,Good course but scala understanding is required for this course. To please register for prior course in the mortification task to easily complete this course.
5322,Not much of mathematical inclination. But the Prof. is really of high standard and he makes sure that you understand everything by the end of any topic as he will run by each topic more than once. Its an introductory course but induces a great amount of interest to learn more!
5323,easily understood and has improve my organ language a lot
5324,Amazing course!! To it!
5325,Awesome Teacher
5326,The instructor is awesome and the contents are very efficientThank you :)
5327,In exceptional class that covers a very complex topic in a digestive and unable way. It's a good balance between concept and application.
5328,a deliberate introductory course for patron to beginners
5329,best course for algorithm
5330,best course to learn patron ....
5331,this is a great course for design thinking - states
5332,"It is an excellent course, very systematically presented. I am hard of hearing but thanks to the subtitles I managed to follow the course. Thank you for making this course available."
5333,Thanks for making studying so much fun!
5334,"Gros: Very good information and methods for running real life business models. The course provided the spreadsheet nodules which allowed you to tinker around and learn them. I consider myself a power Expel user and I picked up some very good new modeling methods. Very concise.Sons: I did Week 2 on my lunch break. Some questions on the quires were a bit vague. Probably need some working knowledge of Expel before taking this class.Of you need to complete a lot of modeling with your job, this is a good course to pick up some skill."
5335,"His course was real fun, thank you, Da! A lot of information, everything clearly put. Thank you! I would change a bit the digital part. Maybe you could add more practical details on SEO and Google AdWords, because the spokesperson presents an agency that wouldn teach the things they offer for money."
5336,"Very information, easy to understand well explained! good instructor"
5337,"Thank you very much, the lesson is very useful to me. in order to understand what the necessity of a function. and the professor clearly explains everything in the right pace."
5338,The best Coursera course I've taken so far! A daring and entertaining stab at a theory of everything :)Thanks!
5339,Great course that allows an introduction into the world of the data scientist. Some instructions video could be improved.
5340,I really liked it! It was very information and I learned a lot. I liked the teachers and how they explained things. I am also glad that it was all free.
5341,"Beware this course, especially if you are new to this area (despite what the course/specialization says). There are very few examples to clarify and illustrate the different topics of the course, but what's worse is that the assignment are almost completely divorced from the instructions video; the assignment and especially the final project are much more complicated than anything presented in the instructions video, so there is no knowledge basis from which the student can operate to complete the assignment/projects satisfactorily or smoothly.I am extremely dissatisfied and wish I hadn't paid for this specialization. Beware."
5342,I really like the top-down approach of this specialization. The iPython code assignment are very well structures. They are presented in a step-by-step manner while still being challenging and fun!
5343,To helpful!!!
5344,Great course. Smart and fun !
5345,"The course content and all assignment can be looked though in one day. Everything really useful will appear in the MOOC 2 and on, as different tools will be given."
5346,Course is Brilliant but not for a complete novice or someone who doesn have enough time to devote to the course. Professor is exceptional. West of luck to all students .
5347,"Sides were very difficult to follow along with. Overall, I learned a good amount though."
5348,"It was very interesting, information and helpful. Thank you!"
5349,Great course.
5350,"His is a great class for any manager or team leader, whether or not you officially want to get your PMP mortification. You will learn a lot, and it's a very manageable workload!"
5351,"In exceptional course which opened my eyes to the world of machine learning. I'm able to see patterns already as to how and when to apply the algorithms learned given different scenario. The instructor Andrew is very good, clear, adhesive and coherent. The discussion group contains almost every help needed and the senators are good. The course is also paced extremely well. But I felt there could have been more. Maybe I would be asking for a lot, but can there be more to this? I would certainly love to go a little deeper than this in the world of machine learning."
5352,His course is a natural linear progression from Entrepreneurship 1.
5353,Great Course.I am not giving 5 stars because we didn't get the assignment to actually implement LDA algorithm and Complete Hierarchical algorithm.May be I am little based because th course is not yet available.Please make th course available.Topics that need to be covered in th course are very import for implementing all these algorithms at lower dimensions.
5354,"A little bit too basic, I expected more."
5355,Good course if you do not have any idea about Fig Data and the technology used.
5356,Very good course
5357,A good introduction! Thanks!
5358,Interesting
5359,it's awesome for beginners!
5360,His course helped me a lot in understanding octavo and the different learning algorithm. I am thankful!
5361,Thank you :)
5362,Well taught and insightful
5363,"His is the first MOOC I have found that fits neatly between beginner level introduction to programming courses, and higher level machine learning/pattern recognition or algorithms courses. The lecture video convey concepts succinct, and the assignment complement the lecture materials."
5364,Very interesting stuff :) I couldn't wait to get started with new lessons. Would love to see a follow up course discussing more advance and complex neuroeconomics papers in the future.
5365,"The course was taught well, however I thought there could have been a few more video with more details. Although I understand that it's really an overview course."
5366,"Good class, very effective hands-on homework tasks. One thing I found is that the time for homework is very underestimated by course creator. It takes much longer to complete the tasks than indicated and within time given. Otherwise, very happy with taking the class."
5367,introduces lot of machine learning technique which are used by practitioner !
5368,great course
5369,"Pollen van Went is a great teacher. The simplifies everything, is clear, consistent, and reviews what she's said. The explains as she goes and encourages coming along with her. His was the perfect into course for someone who knows nothing about HTML. Would definitely take another course by her again."
5370,"Excellent course, properly designed and well presented..."
5371,"top course. interesting, relevant, well structures, good examples"
5372,Not the best one on course. Included many details that are not really relevant and quires just checked if you memories it.
5373,Moved this course! Thank you so much for making this course available.
5374,I think everyone can get junior skill of learning organ here and the classes are very good for us to study with our part-time. Thanks.
5375,very good-course
5376,delightful and very useful course
5377,"I learned a great deal, great explanations! By concept of teaching has greatly matured thanks to th"
5378,"Good Course for beginners,although students with little coming experience will find this course a little slow."
5379,Excellent course!! Thanks a lot!!
5380,"excellent teachers ,teaching to the point."
5381,Very information. I can wait to apply what I have learn from this course. Fig thanks to the professors and away
5382,The quality of video is not good. There is some absurd voice in between. Also the course for week 3 has information related to finance which is beyond understanding levels of a person with no financial background.
5383,"His course teach all things that useful and importance for preparing to everyone who want to know about antimicrobial resistance. On't think a lot. Take this course and learning it, NOW."
5384,Great course. Thanks a lot.
5385,"Short, but sweet."
5386,"His course focused entirely on how to read a balance sheet. You will learn the three principal parts of a balance sheet (asset, liabilities, and equity), how they relate to each other, and how they describe the underlying position of the company. His is illustrated by the professor talking to a number of small business in the Urban-Campaign area.Of you have no experience with accounting or finance, this is probably a great place to start. It's a gentle introduction. However, while the focus on local business is interesting, a relatively large amount of time is spent learning about these business and their owners without necessarily teaching much about accounting or balance sheets in general."
5387,"Great course, thank you very much! I hope to become a scientist and join you in the fight against cancer"
5388,"excellent teaching, great course for understanding the basis of of campaigns and persuasion theories."
5389,"Now, what a fantastic course. Well structures and very well presented by a very knowledgeable palaeontologist. I cannot recommend this course enough."
5390,Good course
5391,Interesting!
5392,To much valuable information and knowledge about food and health
5393,Great course. Short and to the point. It is also very motivation for me to go dig into the topics of Hadoop and CDN.
5394,good exercises for beginners
5395,"Thank you ,i have learned a lot from this course, and this teacher is my favourite teacher."
5396,Great opinions and resources
5397,Great mix of practical advice based on deep academic research.
5398,Great Course !!! Thank you very much
5399,The lecture is not so client taught than other courses in the specialization
5400,it's perfect . you actually don't need to know nothing before starting this course !!
5401,"I really delight in doing this courses, I think they are amazing for new teachers, but also a very good refreshment of good practices (best practices) for experienced teachers."
5402,Really great approach with a lot of useful and easy to get into. Really loved it!
5403,"Great, great, great course. Interactive and engaging. Relevant and focused. His is the future of learning!"
5404,excellent information for researcher..
5405,"Excellent course, easy to follow while still challenging."
5406,"really amazing, insightful and excellent"
5407,"One of the best course I have ever take, what I like the most is on assignment part. The lecturer give me a good instruction of assignment which helped me did it perfectly. Step by step, knowing that I need to develop these step by step logic required to solve the problems."
5408,Great course. A Little bit more complicated that the first one but quite easy anyway for people who wants to learn some programming for first time or if you have to improve your programming skill with a new program language.
5409,"His course really helped me to find my inner foundations, open my eyes and hopefully become a better leader in the future. I can only recommend this course to anyone who is looking to improve themselves and communicate better with fellow colleagues."
5410,"Great material around how to focus on tasks, avoid procrastinator and building an approach to learn new things"
5411,"His course can open our minds to a possible balance between Art and Programation, creating a light atmosphere that embraces all of us to put the projects to work."
5412,"Dear Prof,I take the opportunity to thank prof. Organ Maksimovic for his detailed explanation and excellent course material. I have learnt many exciting things while answering practice and Some work quit questions. Looking forward for Magnetic design (next course in specialization). Once again thanks prof. for all that you gave to us through the course.ThanksPandu S"
5413,It is a good course lead us to knock out the door of machine learning
5414,His is the best course to start learning platon.Or. chuck is good instructor and the rest team is also very responsive.
5415,Clear and simple. Very useful. I recommend it to everybody.
5416,"His was no easy course, but definitely worth the time and effort!"
5417,"not actually much useful course, but still provide some interesting information"
5418,Easy to understand. Great course .
5419,"It was really an excellent course. It was challenging but feasible with a huge quantity & quality of knowledge. I have learned a lot of things about Machine Learning. Thanks a lot, Or Andrew G"
5420,"His is very advanced course I have to say. Is many people have already mentioned, it's very hard to learn. Quite often I feel frustrated, helpless and feel like banging my head against the wall. But if you quit complaining and trying to work it out by poking around the forum and cooling a bit, often you will understand and agree what the professor said. I think it's because it's such an advanced topic that you can't cover the depth and breadth in such a short course (yes, I know it's 16-week!). To compare it with Andrew G's of course, After finishing the latter, I have much confidence and interest in of. But after finishing this course, I feel I know so little and have greater respect for those who's already in this field. That's a good thing I think co you don't have illusion that you master something but in actually you don't. Both courses are great and give me valuable things. Andrew's G course prepares points me to the right direction and give me motivation while Professor Into's course prepares me with the mentality that the process will not be easy but very rewarding."
5421,"His course helped me refresh some basic concepts of control theory, which I had encountered in my ECE studies, as well as see how control fits the big picture of robotics. I wanted to get the basic concepts of control in my software-engineer-structures mind, and this course really helped me do it, although it has (almost) nothing to do with software. Most importantly, the course made me feel that I really have things to give in this field, and persuaded me to keep education myself on the subject."
5422,Or. Tone explained charts in such a clear and relaxed way that my fear of statistics has disappeared! I was also able to apply the course information to manage my daily tasks more effectively. Thank you!
5423,"I enjoyed this course so much, that I have done it twice!"
5424,"Any thanks Victor and Aleksandar! A very interesting course which gave me a good appreciation of parallel programming in Scala, and helped me consolidate what I had learned in the previous 2 courses with Martin.The exercises were just the right level of challenge, and demonstrated well the lecture content."
5425,"It was well designed,information course.I felt it was the course specially meant for me."
5426,"excellent course. Unfortunately i lacked the algebra basis to follow and completely understand all the exercises and examples given. I followed all lessons trough the end, but was not able to do the test flight and complete it. but i will try again in future, when my algebra skill are better"
5427,Excellent course. I was very helpful!!
5428,Great course!
5429,"A nice ending project, but other user reviewing can be reliable. The diagram were still helpful, and made the video more comprehensive."
5430,Highly Recommend!
5431,"very useful, conceptual, understandable and practical."
5432,Awesome course for beginners :D
5433,Clear pattern of graphics design history!
5434,Or. G is has a teaching talent. Thank God
5435,"Learned a lot about the fundamentals of supply and demand, and other related topics. Lectures were information and enjoyable. Assignment tested fundamental knowledge. Recommend to anyone interested in the basis of economics."
5436,I am very disappointed about the content. It is not a course. Or David German is just reading text. To design no learning experience. I would learn much better with just reading a book. It is a shame I was very interested in the subject.
5437,Fantastic course and systematic view on the machine learning domain. Appreciate the broad yet detailed knowledge. Also the programming assignment are great to help me understand deeply and practically. Great instructor!!! Highly recommended!
5438,Easy to understand. Homework is somewhat challenging and the contents are very useful for novice.
5439,Excellent. Thank you Or.Miller.
5440,"Great course! The materials were very interesting, the delivery was just excellent. I learned a lot about French Revolution, it's causes, process and outcome."
5441,I love this course! It is fundamental and interesting .
5442,The Course is very useful in terms of emphasize my work and let me gain more understanding on my current work in order to detect fraud and identify internal control deficiency.
5443,The best and important one to contribute to our challenge in acquire new knowledge in important areas of our lives.
5444,"Though the course reaches you of project management in a crisp way, but I felt that it was a little too fast paced."
5445,Excellent introduction to the use of various tools and some theoretical concepts for data science.
5446,"very useful, practical,and brilliant !!!"
5447,thanks
5448,Short bites regarding strategy and it concepts. A lot of information in a short time but very well presented.
5449,His is a great course
5450,"great course ,easy to follow"
5451,Excellent. thank you.
5452,"A great class for anyone interested in learning the essentials of html, iss, and javascript in relatively short order."
5453,"It's a amazing course for of, thanks for Andrew G!"
5454,Good one . Expected more exercise or assignment .
5455,"4/5: Professor is a good teacher and very well versed in the material, which is very relevant. Only issue I had, which justified a solid 5/5 becoming a 4/5 in my opinion, was that it was a little too slow."
5456,Not at all what I expected--big disappointment
5457,Good insight and tells a lot about midst change.
5458,"Great! His course helps me to know how to write a professional email in the western context, thank you Prof. Wanders."
5459,Excellent!I enjoyed leaning this course.It helped me to recollect my teaching experiences into the theories taught by my instructor of the Each English Now; and share experiences of the teachers from the global society of education who participated in the course.
5460,I really enjoyed this course as it simplifies the subjects and we build some expel sheets.Thank you professor
5461,"His course provide many useful methods to make you aware of your time, after that you can use your time more effectively."
5462,"Very good, Focused in learn the philosophy and know some mathematical tricks in the proofs. It was funny!!"
5463,Very interesting!!!!!
5464,Thank you for sharing your knowledge on how to write professional email in Angel
5465,Thanks to the Professor Brian Rushed for the good explanations. I learned a lot. I find the module 4 so difficult for me. The Prof Christopher Utter is speaking like CNN journalist and not easy for a non native of or English speaker like me to follow.
5466,Amazing course!
5467,Very nice. Essentials are enough to start in Python Programming.
5468,It helped me a lot. Thanks!
5469,Like this course!
5470,"A perfect way to get your attention to 'how' you are studying, and not only 'how much'.Thank you very much for your initiative."
5471,Very useful course for Russian speaking beginners. Everything explained in a very simple understandable manner.
5472,good build up
5473,"Worst course ever. I stopped party through. Too many links to outside stuff. Rests/quires were not based on what was presented in the lessons. West design is horrible, too many negative questions. Glances over the good true information about nutrition to tell us about free range farms, farmers markets, etc., which most people do not have access to or can not afford.Giving it 1 star is being nicePeople who sponsored it should get their money back."
5474,One of the greatest courses I've been in. Thank you!!!
5475,Excellent course. There are many questions to think.
5476,"Outstanding tips to write a scientific paper, know how academic works and also how to organize your work. I recommend!"
5477,Very good teacher.
5478,Very detailed but understandable except for one of the tests...The references made are very difficult to correlate with the answer being sought.
5479,"Thank you again... I really enjoyed the course! Great master of modern & contemporary photography as well as artists who have made an impact on the craft. That said, I would love to have seen & learned more about the early photographic technique, processes & images, i.e. Daguerreotypes, etc."
5480,I learned a lot from this course.
5481,Very interesting course ! Lectures are entertaining and has a lot of real life examples. I recommend it to anyone who is keen on learning new things and wants to learn in non academic environment (eg. at home).
5482,2 weeks in. Must got my Github set. I already feel rewarded.
5483,You really get to learn something :)
5484,Very good interesting an well explained course.
5485,"Please we need of printable ""booklet” of sides (no headshots “and use PALE background) under download below the video screen. I love MOOCs that do this for us to help integrate knowledge. Thanks so much. The course content is very good - I have taken bricks and mortar forensic classes as well as a Forensics MOOC out of China and yours is comparable. But please the downloadable sides? Thanks so muchcom/"",[g,=�o��"
5486,"Great course, the course apply system thinking for business model design or design."
5487,The contents of this lecture are profound and can review variety cases.I recommend this course to who works as lawyer and are interested in environmental dispute cases.
5488,Great introductory course. Very useful subject to understand.
5489,"Is a fiction writer, this class has helped me tremendous."
5490,"Excellent program design, and it was interesting to understand how to construct the network diagram. Thanks very much Margaret. Thanks Coursera!!!"
5491,Excellent course from real web programme!
5492,Excellent! The themes and ideas are very useful and integrated.
5493,"Is a person who hated HTML, CSS and of previously mainly due to my ignorance with the subject, Yakov has helped me in understanding the core concepts as well as common pitfalls that surround the technologies. Now I am a huge fan of web technologies!"
5494,"I have done the first 2 parts and I am half way through the rd and I am finding some of the information to be inaccurate. According to the NHS in the of london failure rate is 2%, not 15% as stated in this course. It also seems to put a bit too much emphasis on Abstinence. I would recommend every one taking this course to do some further research into contraction and find out more accurate information."
5495,very basic course. Easy for a bit experienced programme but I know this is meant for someone who is just starting out
5496,Sinking programming language to hardware sucks. To not waste time on this course.
5497,"It has been an excellent journey for me, I just graduated from dentist school, and want to enter to this field of Public health, to make a change in populations, and communities around the world, this is the start of an adventure for me, before I take my master degree, and travel around the world for doing a volunteering an internship in Africa and Asia. Thank you."
5498,"THIS course is only good if you have basic knowledge regarding ,materials science and this course is highly based on research papers and research domain . Overall a good course ."
5499,Professor Roderick Rates is a fantastic lecturer. It is my first time back at school in 23 years and I followed his classes with ease. Highly recommended course for everyone.
5500,I give it a 4 out of 5 . It way what i imagined it to be..
5501,"Great class packed full of into! The video were fully explanatory in what they hoped to achieve, instructing in the basis of Unity Of. In overall well balanced introductory course, my only problem was with a broken link to an assignment. I had to get the specific course materials from another student because the download link didn't work for me. I was hoping for a Operator/Admit to get back to my complaint, but after a few days a fellow student that had the problem previously was the one to help me out. 4/5 Stars. He kind to your classmates, you'll learn a lot from them as well!"
5502,A course very rich in information and experimental. Very good to have direct contact with great researches of the area. And Barbara is a sweet person.
5503,His was a very interesting course. I only wish it could be made deeper and extended a bit!
5504,Great class. Great professor.
5505,The best course taught by the best teacher!
5506,"Or.Chuck is really a good teacher and a good enter, the first lesson I learned from him was Python, and this(IHTS) is the second one, really want to say thank you face to face with Or.Chuck and really want to join the office hours, but whatever I want to say thanks again to Or.Chuck and Coursera, for all knowledge you gave me, thanks!"
5507,very interesting course; the subject treated here seems to have wide applications in geometry and number theory; the weekly assignment were challenging at times but very thought provoking and I very much enjoyed myself during the course despite some minor flaws
5508,Great introduction to the field and specialization.
5509,Moved it
5510,"There was very little actual content in this course, and I can't say I learned very much. In insight, I wish I hadn't paid for a verified certificate."
5511,"The course is great but it would be better to have it over 8 weeks to diffuse the amount of valuable information in Week 5. Also, charts should be numbered for easier references in discussions."
5512,"His course has managed to change my life. Thanks Northwestern University and Coursera, and special thanks to Weigh for her talent to teach us how to performance, collaborate, and negotiate much more better."
5513,"Short but complete course, more practical than tropical.I learnt a lot of."
5514,Great!
5515,"Straight forward to follow, fantastic course for beginners."
5516,Awesome course. Well explained with lots of examples.The must see if interested about the basis of algorithmic.
5517,"Only few starting video give new information and technique, the rest 80% is quite useless. Course would be much better if it gives real tips and technique rather than constant repetition of the same information in different forms. Of you read the course contents - you already get 75% of what is presented in the video."
5518,"It this moment, this course has been really good."
5519,"His course is a solid introduction to Environmental Saw, a topic where it's exceedingly easy to get lost in the weeds, so to speak. The instructor for this course is simply delightful. High energy and engaging, it's clear that no matter who the named parties are in a case, the ultimate client is the environment. Of I had had the opportunity to take a brief survey course like this one when I was starting college back in the 1980s, I might well have gone into this field as a profession. Excellent course!I did not participate in the forms, so I cannot speak to the value that they may or may not have brought to the course. I did, however, do all the reading, and I think it's important to have students understand how to pause out meaning and significance from these often dry documents."
5520,Excellent introspective course about the global financial crisis and the way it was managed by authorities and institutions. The causes of the crisis are very well described and the professor's viewpoint is
5521,The best practical approach to data visualisation.
5522,"It's an amazing class that I've ever attended to. I got a lot of useful and interesting information and other things about of, and I think, that I'll keep on learning other stuff in this field. Thank you, Andrew G :)"
5523,Road & Simple to follow - some basic path is required. Any models introduced and extremely useful to have in your toolbox.
5524,A great introduction to the field of Machine Learning to novices. The step by step method to explain this complex field in simple terms is really helpful. I would really recommend this as the first course in Machine learning for somebody interested in forming a strong foundation. Good mix of theory and practice. Thanks Andrew G for sharing his knowledge. Looking forward to more courses from him in future.
5525,"Brilliant course.Didn't buy it, so the quires didn't work which was a bit disappointing, but the content is very straight forward to follow and thought provoking. You will be a better person just watching and thinking about this. You don't even have to agree with it!"
5526,"Inspiring, direct, practical and very well structures."
5527,Excellent!!! Very interesting and very well explained. Now I see machine learning opportunities all around me... :)
5528,Great contents and teachers!
5529,Great Course
5530,its a very good place to start from
5531,Great overview of the basis and the laws provide an excellent platform for learning R.
5532,Excellent Work!
5533,very interessant and very nice.
5534,"quite clear lecture, and very nice teacher.Helpful to those who are new to of."
5535,"Very useful course for anyone looking to get a comprehensive view of of. The course does a great job balancing lectures, quires and hands-on assignment."
5536,Great overview of Corporate finance with useful expel exercises which are related to lectures and reading.
5537,In exceptional course in intermediary programming!
5538,Extremely well planned and interesting.
5539,"His is such a good course that gives a good intuition into Machine Learning. For me it has given a new sense of appetite to learn and visit Multivariable calculus, Numerical Methods, Probability. I hope it will trigger the same for many others too. The prof has taken a lot of effort to help us visualized Machine Learning. His efforts are truly appreciated! I would strongly recommend this course for everyone suitable and most importantly interested in the subject."
5540,His is one of the most practical strategy session you will come across. I have read many books and have also gone through webinars and sessions on Coursera but this course by CBS just stands out.His course is best suited for both earners as well as practitioner. I would love to undergo more such courses designed by CBS.
5541,Simple and great for beginners. I loved the the way the basis where presented. Very good course indeed!
5542,"A hard course, but very useful. It helped me a lot"
5543,prof of is the best!!!
5544,"Challenging for those without programming experience. But with hard work and forum, you can do it."
5545,Great course!
5546,"While the material is undoubtedly useful, te structure of the assessment is not very helpful. For example, in week 3 we are asked to create data frames from input files: these are presented in descending order of complexity for clean. Furthermore, the points for most of the questions are 6.66, despite what are very different demands fore each part. In the final week, the dictionary of state names is counterproductive in answering part one (some state names are region names) and one can either get 100% or one fails the course (as one question is worth 50% of the grade.)Some of the autograder feedback is so terse as to be downright infuriating. Add to that frequent issues with the notebook crashing and much of this coursework was an exercise in unnecessary frustration rather than increasing enlightenment."
5547,I didn't learn a lot from this course. It didn't explain technical of architecture of of.
5548,"Great course - lots of detailed information. The teacher spoke clearly and very deliberate. However, I just wanted to audit the course."
5549,"I've been struggling with the learning process since high school. Over the years I've initially approached the chance to learn with enthusiasm and determination (""this time it will be different""), only to be detailed by wavering perfectionism and the steadfast conviction that I can't possible live up to expectations (""if I'm not perfect, then it doesn't mean anything""). I've fled more often than not, taking a fail or missing an opportunity rather than face the possibility of being merely average, or worse. To taking Learning Now to Learn was not just about understanding the process of learning from a tactical point of view, but showing that I could follow my goal all the way through to the end.Fortunately Learning Now to Learn provides a very suppurative environment in which to learn and, importantly, make mistakes, without the whole world come tumbling down. The purpose of the course is not to identify the good earners from the bad earners, but to provide everyone with the chance to learn in a non-competitive way. Is someone who has feared learning for a long time, it was incredibly, monumentally important that Learning Now to Learn be a place to enjoy the process of learning, rather than the outcome of it. And that's what the course provided.I'm going to be testing the ideas and strategics from Learning Now to Learn over the next few months, leading up to the start of my second year at university. By goal is to focus on the process of learning, not the product (an important point from the course). It's my first small step in overcoming my fear."
5550,"Very good course, extensive information, examples to form a clear picture on business strategics in general and in particular in emerged market like Russia."
5551,For people interested in deeper knowledge of photography this is the course to take!
5552,Clear Concise and Well explained course by creator of Scala Language Martin Odersky. Awesome course for anyone learning functional programming using Scala.
5553,His course made my knowledge clear. There is a lot practice and that cool.
5554,"The course already needs and actualization, plus they must fix the order of the first assignment. Besides that, this is a really useful and fulfilling course."
5555,"Very engaging ! Easy to follow, and well structures."
5556,"His is not a beginner's course, so a decent grasp of the R language is necessary. It is best to take this course after some saints with Data Camp, Will, or Rode School."
5557,Great content!
5558,"It is a good course, but probably just a little too short. I think it will be a good idea to develop some arguments more in deep."
5559,A Must have course for beginners in Data Exploration and Analysis. The best part is that exposure to these amazing concepts in R.
5560,Great course!
5561,His course has complimented the lessons I have been learning and I appreciate it is on-demand and self-paced. I am a busy professional with a family and I need to be able to learn on my own time. Great material. Thanks!
5562,His course was very helpful to my current position working in a Hospital. It was very thought through and I enjoyed it! It kept me wanting to know more! Thank you!
5563,Comprehensive course encompassing multiple faces of historical and international relevance.
5564,Good teaching by Or Chuck.
5565,Course was pretty awesome for the started.
5566,"The course was very good - especially the map-reduce part I found very well explained and inspiration. The problem sets were thought-provoking and really taught me a lot.Two things that could be improved:1) The problem sets are really nice (again, map-reduce is the best one), but there are quite a few errors in the description, a lot of information is dated (e.g. in is.1 the twitter link is old), and working with the grade can be very clumsy. See Machine Learning by Andrew G to see how to design perfect, easy to operate and submit problem sets. Perhaps work with PyCharm creator?2) The second to last part was a bit lacking - it was basically swimming though all different types of database, which didn't make me feel like I really acquired any skill. Because of how little time was spent on each database type and there were so many, I don't really remember much of it now (hardly anything to be honest)."
5567,Very helpful. I've learned a lot.
5568,Interesting and fun to watch. Not so practical as other courses in the Specialisation but definitely good to know.
5569,"I really liked the course has been developed and delivered by Prof Andrew G. The course is cleverly designed to accommodate people at different skill levels. While the video, assignment and lecture notes are very valuable and free to access, it would be more encouraging for people to join the Machine Learning working community if the certificate fee is lesser than what it is now. Thanks to Coursera, Prof Andrew G and all the volunteers."
5570,"Great course, Charles does a great job teaching the course! opens up the possibilities of the origins of life and other possible life in our solar system and universe. thanks to Coursera."
5571,"simple and clear for beginners , very interesting"
5572,Excellent course. I feel like i know so much already even though we scratched the tip of the iceberg. Will definitely knoll in more advanced courses.
5573,great course
5574,His was a great introduction to Clinical Trials. I would recommend taking a statistics refreshed before this course if you haven't had one recently.
5575,"Prof. Hitoshi Murayama has Science the course out of dark matter! Amazing introductory course for young aspirin minds. Professor has taken a comic ride through the greatest minds of our history. It is structures beautifully like an atom, into four lectures, each more thought provocative than the latter. An be completely understood by anyone with curiosity and high school knowledge of basic science."
5576,it was very challenging and interesting
5577,Good course to learn basis of cloud computing and CDN.However Fig Data part needs to be more elaborate.
5578,Must for fresh beginner in this topic
5579,Great class
5580,Thanks a lot to Prof. Charles Severance for having a such wonderful journey of patron. I hope you will coming with some more amazing lectures like this and I am going to definitely join all those.(I love the way you teach)
5581,"His is a good course, now I can do a lot more things with Python"
5582,"Good, but overemphasizes nice software product (graphlab)."
5583,"I learn some interesting things. The course gets better for week 3-4. However, the course could use better the Coursera format and strength.The terrified certificate is price compared to other courses.In overall it’s good."
5584,His course is very good and fantastic way to start the Objective-C.
5585,"Great course! The video are fun, and I received a lot of great feedback from my fellow classmates."
5586,"Great course regarding professionalism, it touches as many aspects as possible, which, to me, is pretty useful. Thanks!"
5587,Great introduction to Mind Energy.
5588,Love the course...
5589,A great course for starting to learn Chinese with the additional goal of learning to pass the important HSK level 1 proficient test. Instructor is of In is one of most dedicated college professor I have ever meet in my years taking courses at university or Coursera! It really shows in her teaching style and the constant feedback that she provides.
5590,"Great course and resource material in Machine Learning. Easy to follow if we have some background knowledge of path, statistics and programming skill. Thanks professor G for creating such a good course."
5591,Brilliant bootstrap. Trap on your boots and be prepared for a journey into the inner workings of Bootstrap (shamelessly 'borrowed' this put from the course).
5592,thank you so much!!
5593,I loved this course! I was almost sad when it was over and want more!
5594,I really enjoy this course and all the activities involved.
5595,Very well-designed course covering the basic groundwork for R.
5596,I love this course and especially the professor! It was a pleasure taking it and being part of this little online classroom :)
5597,"It's a fine course which enables you to learn some interesting things about simple games and a branch of mathematics most people are unaccustomed with. It doesn't need much previous knowledge, although a decent level of mathematics and mathematical logic is very helpful especially when it comes to understanding new terms and definitions. The professor helps you with simple examples when something seeming difficult to get comes up, but beware his weird sense of humor! Enjoy the course!"
5598,"Very useful, nice practical assignment"
5599,"It opens a wide perspective about managing, being manager only is the traditional managing concept, but after this course i knew about many other rules...it is very helpful course."
5600,Good introductory information.
5601,"A good basic introduction to photography. Some nice resources are shared, including books and web sites."
5602,Andrew G and his team prepared well structures course full of fantastic study materials.
5603,"Maybe a good course, but you need to be an of crack to be able to install the software and make it works. Online help does not help. Irritating! 45USD lost. I don't recommend this course."
5604,I love this course!
5605,Cleared the crisis in my head!
5606,"Great information, given over in an easy to digest and interesting way."
5607,"His amazing course brought new skill in my life. I wrote for public, and my article ""India and Armenia: the Connection"" got published. I learned how to make arguments and support evidence to make the arguments stronger. I learned the strategics on how to make a visual analysis. He learned to write innovations and do proper situations. I would strongly recommend my peers to take this course.With best regards,Lane Mehrabian, Armenia"
5608,"I understand why R was chosen to be the statistical software package chosen here, but I personally don't like it and professionally use SAS JMP."
5609,"I found this course very interesting, information, and engaging. The instructor and lectures are interesting, and the topics covered are fascinating. The quires cover the most important concepts of the course without being unnecessarily difficult. I have recommended this course more than once already, and would do so again. Of I found that another course were created to follow this one, I would definitely take it."
5610,"Really Helpful lovely course that you can do in your own time, some very good tips and methods of how to use time more effectively in learning new things."
5611,Great learning opportunity! I learned a great deal and took my Cava skill to the next level.
5612,Good introduction to basic circuits and components!
5613,very good course
5614,very useful
5615,"His course was very real, current and useful in my life. The content was well structures & delivered exceptionally well. I liked the fact that it was both theoretical robust and practically inclined, the examples utilised where reliable and easy to follow. I also appreciated the passion is the delivery of the course by the lecturer, her enthusiasm made watching all the video worthwhile. Thank you for this introduction- it made a significant difference in my life"
5616,His short course offers information and fun real world examples.
5617,Great course.
5618,A great course!
5619,Excellent course. Organized and with teaching materials of good quality.
5620,Good! Actually I think this course is useful no matter what other people think.
5621,I enjoyed taking this course. It is best course for a started like me with little path back ground which I studied nearly 9 years back in college to get over all big picture and looking forward to start my career in machine learning. Thank you professor for making this course and sharing
5622,Like this coerce but some more topic should be added in first week. this can be cover within 3 days.
5623,"It was awesome. Everything was understandable, the material was good and Pollen van Went, Oh.D. is an excellent teacher."
5624,"The material was good, but I did notice a couple of lectures and in-course questions presented out of order. That really turned me off, however were quires. In weekly quires the first answer was always the right answer. In the final quit most of the questions had the first answer as the right answer. Since randomizing the answers is so obvious and easy, I am really at a loss why the quires would be presented in this way."
5625,"I did the MOOC just to break the ice and have a general idea about this world of writing for young audiences. I think the course is fair and quite complete, has some very interesting insight, and the video as very information and the perfect length (by the time your head can't take more into, they are over). Thank you very much, it has been a pleasure."
5626,Some of the evaluation methods just allow other people how doesn't do to much work to just pass...
5627,"The teacher was great, video, organisation...I´m really glad to have done this course. I´m going to get more knowledge and change my professional career. Now I believe that is possible."
5628,"I have mixed feelings about this course. In one hand, scope is ambitious and getting to attend a course by G Into is a luxury. In the other hand, some topics are addressed confusing (e.g. Hopfield Gets) or without going into much detail. But I think the worst of this course, and I wish Coursera would take care of that, is some quires being completely broken (missing or incorrect data), forcing you to go to Forms to get the correct question.There are big gaps of data and no course biography to follow or complete the missing gaps (lecture resources, when available, is just papers on the topic). Also, the course would benefit from better programming exercises... as it stands it is just ""download a program, complete a couple of methods, fill in the gaps on a quit"""
5629,Amazing teaching for wonderful subject.
5630,"perfect course, good lecture, nice knowledge"
5631,"It's ok, but.....It uses Terms I do not understand. an you make it easier!"
5632,Excellent ! very rewarding ; hope to find in the future course like this one.Thank you again
5633,Great course for into to machine learning!
5634,"Honestly, I am absolutely delighted to have access to that course. Information is reliable, strong, you can have access to a huge number of articles, studies... It is well structures. By only regret, is that there is a lack of actual images of the actions and the process described."
5635,I have learned a lot from this curse.Thanks
5636,Baths covered is very preliminary. But the coverage of course is great.
5637,Thank you Professor!I learned a lot from you. I'm applying it in my real business and really happy about the result.Also I got 91.1 score at my third try in taking the exam.Thank you University of Michigan.
5638,Very practical course
5639,A really good course on business writing
5640,Excellent introduction to Unity's engine although I found it doesn't hurt to know a bit of engine and programming to really grass the basis and more from this course. Thanks for doing it continue with the rest nodules of the Same Design and Development.
5641,very good. I appreciated the teaching
5642,In interesting course. Lectures are small and very easy to comprehend. The whole course has a great structure and help you learn and remember things!
5643,Very useful course.
5644,I hope to have gained some useful tools to beat my procrastinator; at the very least this course has given me the ability to identify when I slip into procrastinating and methods to break that cycle.
5645,Rich and enjoyable
5646,Moved the course! Will definitely try to get my hands on further material to study more.
5647,the best course i have been knoll in my lifethanks for allappreciated
5648,"In great introductory course for those looking to get started into IOT ,great if you're looking for breadth rather than depth , which I feel is essential because of nature of of as a domain requires one to be familiar with multiple fields like embedded systems , types of programming languages ,networking , micro-controller etc simultaneously . Prof. Harris explains complex things in really simple manner without overwhelming the learner which I think is necessary for a beginner to retain interest in exploring further ."
5649,The course is a little bit basic for me but it is interesting and didactic.Thank you to Professor An Harris.
5650,"I am a Maude engineer who found this course pretty amazing course , never ever gone through similar course, indeed, I will visit and pay for it; reliable and sound basis of of and Systems, looking for advanced course for the same or better coach to include them on my 2017/2018 developmental plan in course.I will send you my comments although I am not among top scored due to lack of time and lacking the good time management skill.However I am confident that I t will be of helpful as I am 12 years of experience in gas ,oil and energy projects management and quality in leading energy companies in Maude Arabia in addition to hold master degree of engineering management in 2014.Thank you very much outstanding instructor and professorsMobasher , K.S.A -Jeddah Citystudent"
5651,"His course is literally changing my life. Discovering various tools for learning and firing out which ones and in which combinations work best for me has been an interesting and fruitful journey. Studying for GRE has become fun for me.In short, I like it so much!Thank you for creating this thoroughly thought through course and for allowing to access it indefinitely."
5652,"The course met my expectations. The exercises were relevant to the discussions and the level of depth made it easy to follow. A fine course to introduce oneself to HTML, CSS, and Javascript basis."
5653,"Really enjoying this course hope you will do more courses on the Space program i.e. Space shutters etc, and rocket science/baths would be good as well.."
5654,"West full stick courses, you can even understand how Angular works better"
5655,Great knowledge for wind energy.Great lessons.
5656,"It is the most important course that anyone have to learn if one is going to start a life as a student.Also, it is a wonderful course. It has a lot of tips and the teachers are excellent."
5657,Putting some numbers on the slide without any explanation of how it works. Only saying what it does.Leading almost only his slide without further information.To basic formula such as eg. Cannon there...
5658,"Great to learn. But some of the assignment instructions were not clear enough, and took a lot of time to figure out."
5659,Good into for a non-biology person like myself
5660,Met me deal with data in a new way.
5661,"Is a very good course for learn chinese, I learn much in this course."
5662,Great class!
5663,Very clear and understandable.
5664,"Its a very good course to get yourself started with Python, The instructor is very patient with explaining all the concepts. Plus love the auto grade and the assignment"
5665,His course is a very nice introduction to R.I would advise to complete the will assignment as they provide good practice to memories the commands. Sometimes it feels like will use a lot of positive reinforcement to the point of getting the impression of being trained like a dog.Still I felt a great sense of accomplishment completing the course.
5666,"Really excellent activities and explanations and examples. I loved so much about it. The content was excellent, the time with students was excellent... Really great!His makes me want to visit New Work!"
5667,Very nice course for introduction to food nutrition. The material was pleasant and easy to follow. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a better understanding of what they are eating and what can be done to have better and wealthier diet.
5668,the very first course you should really pass!
5669,Super! Very valuable experience with Bootstrap!
5670,His Course is really awesome for beginners/ professional......especially on the content/video/study references mentioned.
5671,"Covers the topics of both digital and traditional marketing channels:-Radio, Television, Newspapers, Magazines, But-of-Some Media-Social Medial, Logs, Websites, Streaming and other online platformsROI (Return over Investment), Consumer Decision Journey, Digital Marketing Evolution"
5672,A lot of into cramped in long video makes it confusing sometimes
5673,Very interesting to start developing a first pp.
5674,I loved the way our instructor made the lectures more sticky by incorporating them in children stories!
5675,"Incorrect references, subtitles that do not follow the video. Questions in the questionnaire that have not been studied and which one does not even know where to find references. The worst course of this certificate."
5676,Amazing course with lots of reflections and insight!
5677,"Excellent. By favourite machine learning course since Andrew G's class. Thorough treatment. Took us from easier hand-holding to deep in the implementation details. Talked both about theoretical considerations as well as practical fine tuning. Would maybe liked to have seen a bit more talked about the problems with data that can affect model fit (multicollinearity / slew / etc) but time constraint don't allow it in an already excellency ""meat"" course."
5678,Meticulously designed for crisp understanding!
5679,"The course as a whole is excellent (5 stars), however, the Capstone project part of the specialization consists of 3 submission that are reviewed by other students. Consequently the quality of the reviews are of the same level as the student itself - which obviously limits the learning from feedback."
5680,Vice course and interesting material but the other students evaluation is quite subjective.
5681,I enjoyed a lot learning this Course. Well explained by great lectures.
5682,so good but hope organ subtitles more perfectly
5683,great course.. top class collection of articles to help in communication. Most of the knowledge is in the articles then the video themselves
5684,Provides a quick overview on what constitutes Data Science.
5685,"Long and balanced course. The first weeks are long with too much materials, that I think, should be separated to more weeks, than last weeks has no any new materials just short discussion prompt. Maybe it is my fault, but I waited for something else, this was my first philosophy and sinfulness course."
5686,"Simple, fast-paced and adhesive. Of you want to know your shortcomings in writing, this is the course you need to knoll in."
5687,The instructor does a very poor job of explaining the material.
5688,Great.Very useful for me.Thank you so much!
5689,The lectures do exactly what you need. He starts with just enough theory to help you understand a concept and then jumps into applying equations and solving example problems. The biggest problem is that there are examples that are wrong every once in a while during the lectures and one or two in each quit. It's not a huge deal because sometimes firing out where he went wrong helps you to understand the problem better. It can be annoying for some examples though.
5690,"It was a good course, I wished more courses about Arduino and examples of what we can do with the platform in real life applications. Arduino seems more accessible that raspberry i, in terms of price (I believe I cannot complete the course about this particular platform), the software (myself I have trouble with Sinus, perhaps due to my low level of knowledge), in Arduino I used mostly the 123d simulate, which helped me a lot. I am grateful to Prof. Harris, the Coursera team and the California University."
5691,"It was fast, but provided a good overview. I would like some cases to work and to apply the methods to."
5692,"nice, information, update new tears, research, and easy to understand"
5693,"Excellent tutorials on the difference between lists, dictionaries, and rubles, and how to manipulate them."
5694,it was very interesting based on very academic knowledge
5695,Learned a lot through this course! Thank you
5696,you are great thank you :)
5697,"Good,practical, insightful and unable. Challenges some old methods and points to more effective ones. Would have liked more intensity, action points and tools to have given it a 5 star rating."
5698,Good course.
5699,"Excellent course, well presented and at pace and level of difficulty well suited to Coursera."
5700,great explanation of the concepts involved!
5701,Such thorough knowledge of the happening in Middle east.
5702,One of the most insightful and educational courses I have taken. The professor is very interesting and captures your attention. The hands on negotiations are fun and valuable. I definitely recommend it to everyone.
5703,I learn a lot from the courses that I took from Coursera. I recommend it to everybody.
5704,Awesome course!!! very satisfied!!
5705,Easy introductory course by very interesting lecturer!
5706,Buy been Professor!
5707,"I,I'm sorry to say that this course wasn't really useful. I had the impression to see dozens of INTRODUCTION video about sustainables cities. Because:1. In 5 weeks you have time to cover in details all the aspects of sustainable cities: energy, transport, waste, building, sharing economy. The condition is to focus each week to a topic.2. It is too much based on powerpoint presentation and not at all on example. Concepts stay concepts: we didn't visit one single town, a connected building, an innovative waste management system. You quote 300 living laws, let's go !3. Pictures from the powerpoint are at least for half of them taken from pictures bank. Synthetic images, not concrete. Desapointing.4.. Always the same example: Also, Copenhagen... That about the rest of the world ?5. Sides from WWH and ICLEI are clearly revolting. Is it some publicity for them ??? His is not the place for that.In contrast, congratulations to Julia Voytenko, for her speech about sharing economy: it was clear, precise, focused.Please do your best to improve your courses: you have the knowledge, let's spread it."
5708,"Is this is the final course of the entire specialization, I expected a lot about the content and related video regarding lectures and projects. It didn't disappoint me. Congratulation to Him for making it a great learning experience and giving me additional tools to pursue my goals of being a better Nails developer."
5709,its awesome. all i can say i have further more increased my macroeconomics skill which i have learned in my school as well as 1 and 2 year of my college. there are certain new concepts which i was not aware of and thus this course helped me in getting understand those major concepts very well.thanks course
5710,Excellent short course for corporate finance beginners.
5711,Excellent explanation by the faculty. I really appreciate and happy to attend this course. Thanks.
5712,It is fantastic as it is very essential for life. Thanks.
5713,"it is so good, so interesting, so information!"
5714,A political view of the Saber Conflicts.
5715,Good for states. Very detailed explanations of core programming principles in Cava.
5716,Thank you for this course! I have newly started it but it helped me very much!
5717,"The course is a bit disorganized and could have been better. While the topics are really interesting and Geoffrey is really knowledgeable, a lot of simple concepts have been made seemed complicated from the way they have been presented -- often requiring external follow up studies (and often discovering in surprise how simple they actually are). such as, contrasting divergence (CD1) algorithm to train Restricted Bolazamann Machine (read wikipedia to get it in under 2 mind), sanctioning of sigmoid belief net etc. I believe, the issue arises from sides based teaching, where a slide of texts is presented and then there is a long monologue of how that system works from start to end. A more useful approach would have been to actually draw-and-talk (good example of such courses are Machine Learning by Andrew G, Same Theory (esp. Even Newton-Grown parts). Nonetheless, the course brings forth a lot of Neutral Met topics and is definitely worth taking if you are willing to study outside the course also."
5718,His is the course I wanted to finish and expel in Coursera!!
5719,love the teaching style of Chuck and the very actionable tests and script providedthis is an essential foundation training. cannot recommend it more
5720,Thank you! Great course!
5721,West way to get started with a new programming language !
5722,Inspiring leadership knowledge.
5723,Very interesting and valuable applications for studying
5724,It is a great opportunity for whom wants to break into Financial Analysis and Corporate Finance.
5725,pretty good started course. I liked 40 min Case Study video at the end. It was very helpful to watch the instructor do the analysis from start to finish.
5726,"well, since i got stocked with my university homework, i couldn't get the chance to finish this course as i was expecting to. but, definitely i would like to let you know that this has been an amazing journey for me, an ADHD who is obliged to be on britain so that the society gets comfortable around me. although it never made me feel better about myself, but it made people around me to stop complaining about my energy. after all, i am still an adduct to this pill, but at the end, thanks to More University guns, i succeeded to know my body and what it goes through when i tend to not be ADHD. i have never got to reach the treatment parts, but at least i'm going to give a lecture on the side effects of britain in university.at the end, thanks, for letting us know. that was the best gift ever :)"
5727,thanks to prof and couler for this wonderful course. I wish the programming part was taught separately from basic. I have taken the previous course which was case study approach with respect to which it was slightly tough.
5728,"Really great course. Learned a lot, thanks !"
5729,"Amazing course! I enjoy every video, every interview. Professor is cool, a professional . I like that you provided not only the theory itself, but also information sides, interviews with so interesting people, plus gave/showed visual examples. Sides are of great length (not too long, not too short), information is valuable and only on business. I had a great , kind , customer experience studying your lectures)) And its more than lectures, its a joy.Thank you for your job!"
5730,"The lecture is clear, insprational, and helpful."
5731,"Excellent Course. Great instructor, very well structures content. I loved the last assignment, had a lot of fun building my own webpage. Brilliant learning experience, will definitely keep practicing."
5732,"Is the second course in the specialization, I continue to find the material covered to be useful and fairly easy to learn. Between the first and second course, I feel like both courses were able to lay and build upon a foundation of knowledge with each chapter covered. I did find the second course to be a little more difficult, but one would expect this with the addition of more code learned. However, I still felt like the grade exercises weren't too difficult to complete as a beginner to Python. An't wait to knoll in the next course!"
5733,"Of possible I would rate a 4.5 out of 5 for this course. The lectures are very good and comprehensive (compared to all other sources I found in the web) at explaining how cryptocurrencies (especially BTC) work and what the up- and downsides are. The workload for lecture video is pretty low for each week (1-oh a week) which makes the learning target pretty easy to achieve in the proposed time. I found the programming assignment quite difficult when beginning with each one, since one needs to read and understand (most) of several hundred lines of started code and also needs to understand the task setting which uses a somewhat different terminology than used in the lectures. Also for assignment 1 and 3 there is no simple test code provided to at least partially test your code submission candidates. That makes it hard to debut in case of small logical errors that cannot be detected by the compilers but probably break the complete solution and result in a very low score. I had no experience in Cava programming before the start of this course but with a one day crash course of Cava for Python programme I managed to complete all assignment in time (and learn at least the basic principles of Cava, which is nice for itself). Each assignment is expected to take oh by the creator of the course. The come up with a high score (not just passing) I needed to invest about 5-9 hours for each assignment which is probably but not exclusively due to the little knowledge of Cava. Nevertheless I would encourage the creator of this course to use Python assignment for future courses since this would make prototyping a lot easier (due to it's interactivity) and attract more students without having real downsides (at least to my knowledge). All in all I really enjoyed this course and would like to thank all lectures and the Princeton University for making this course accessible free of charge for everybody. Thanks a lot!"
5734,easy to follow
5735,"By opinion about the course is without doubt positive. It is feared to both college-educated people and for those people without previous knowledge course. The course allows different levels of depth; both can be used to acquire general knowledge about terrorist and counterterrorism, to elaborate on specific aspects, because it offers the student a varied and useful bibliography and recommended reading.Is far as the platform is concerned, it is very intuition and easy to handle, even an online course.By feeling has been to meet not only the fastness of the subject, the platform can be part of the course and the ability to communicate through forms with students sharing concerns and seek solutions.It's an easy course to follow although it online because it is well structures and has a good organization.His does not mean that the course is exceeded without hard work, as the estimated 5/6 hours a week of education is pretty accurate.It is not the typical course online almost testimonials. You have to work hard if you want to get a good result.To maybe it's the most rewarding thing I have done. From what I have learned and by the possibilities I see this field.It has also been rewarding by Professor Or. Win Baker and his team for their skill and education, they have been tremendous didactic. Of it were not for them, I would not have been able to finish. And fellow students from all countries, from forms and debates that have exposed enriching opinions. Thanks to all."
5736,Very basic but needed for people not introduced to R! Thank you!
5737,"Really great into to machine learning - I think this class would have been better if the programming assignment had been a bit more difficult, but overall really enjoyed this class and looking forward to continuing with the specialization."
5738,"Of you want to memories what year countries started their public broadcast systems, this is the course for you.It only briefly discusses critical paradise shifts and shows. The course lacks a critical analysis element and the video lectures are unstructured. It would be almost impossible to pick three key points they want you to learn from each video."
5739,Excellent and clear explanations.
5740,very good business strategy introduction
5741,"I really appreciate this course, clear, practical with a lot's of tools !"
5742,"Great content. I would have preferred it if we had gone through a real example. One the less, it was a great course I definitely found the consumer decision journey model and the ZMOT very insightful."
5743,Expensive software. I haven't download the domo version yet but would soon download.
5744,Excellent Course. Deep the good work
5745,Appreciate this added module to address the people side of business.
5746,Love typography and love this course.
5747,"Great instructor, great course, easy to follow."
5748,Great into or research.
5749,That was a really interesting course. I now understand why finance has developed into what it is today and also how and why it failed in 2008. Great course well taught.
5750,Learned the basis in Chinese. I am glad I took this course before taking classes at my local school.
5751,Exceptional. Simple and understandable and also useful in every way. The video are made in such a way that you remember most of the things.
5752,The course is very goodSpecially designed for the beginners of big data/cloud.Highly recommended.
5753,"Letter than the Data Scientist's toolbox, but not a great introduction to R. When I'm learning a new language, I don't want to know about data types and for loops. A detailed example showing the strength of this language would be better."
5754,Great course to introduce the basis of HTML!
5755,The professor did an outstanding job with explaining key terms and definitions. I loved the into and how he broke down the difference between accounting and finance. Very information. The only thing I suggest to add is a few examples in between formula that students can evaluate themselves during a brief pause.
5756,"Wont think twice ,Of you want to dive into game development just knoll"
5757,"A very good course for Introducing to Fig Data and Loud, the teacher speak very clear and the explains are short and clear.Good material and very good structures.Thanks for this course"
5758,I know it will help me in my future life-long studies. I will recommend this course to everyone.
5759,Vice course. Delicately designed programming assignment.
5760,Good Course
5761,Sides are a bit monotonous.
5762,It's just a super-interesting course!
5763,"Awesome class. One of the most meaningful compendiums of innovative thought available on-line today. Vice work, Or. G."
5764,"I found this course very useful, and the video were really well-made and entertaining despite the dry subject."
5765,awesome course can't wait for the fist lesson!!
5766,His course was extremely interesting and well presented. I fully intend to take Part 2 of the course.
5767,Straightforward and gives the required pieces to make a couple simple games that actually play well and are easy to expand. A great introduction to Unity and C# scraping.
5768,neat course by nice team
5769,"In excellent course with lots of information video, useful temples and assignment!"
5770,love Professor Siedel and how he reaches the course!
5771,Great information delivered in an engaging way. Thank you!
5772,Pretty information and helps you refresh the basis.
5773,"His course saved me. I started my business but nobody knew I existed. For entrepreneurs, it doesn't matter how good you are in your field. You need to be able to sell your services or product to customers. New clients will not come to you. You have to go to them. And that's how this course saved me. It guides you through the selling process right from defining your market through to closing the sale. Before the course, I had no concept of this process. Now I feel confident executing the sales process and getting my first clients through a SALE rather than word-of-mouth. A highly recommended time investment for entrepreneurs. Thank you Or. Craig Wortmann."
5774,All in all a great course with very valuable information to make a data scientist better at his job. However it could have been covered in 2 weeks time
5775,I thought it was a great course. It really prompted me to consider the different aspects of the political landscape and how it will look practically different in the coming years as my generation enters into the field. I recommend this course as a good starting ground for those wanting to gain more perspective for those considering the public service route.
5776,Awesome Course and Teacher. Of you are wondering if you should take it or not just do it.
5777,Excellent introduction into patron would recommend to anybody thinking of automatic some of their tasks using simple patron.
5778,"Really enjoyed the pacing, detail of lectures and complexity of assignment. Well drafted course."
5779,"Professor Craig Right,"
5780,"A very information course, clears a lot of sides I only thought were nothing but weaknesses, also provides great tips in learning and developing yourself."
5781,"Great class. I wish they had more classes related to of from UVA. I greatly enjoyed the lectures, the reading and the whole process. There are so many areas of of. I hope UVA will continue to produce classes with focus on those of areas."
5782,"Good Introduction to Embedded Systems and operating systems, discuss interesting topics and the architecture of of, a little hard and challenging but it worth it."
5783,A very good course to explore the keys to dear more effectively.
5784,His course is boon for designer. Very detailed and absolutely rewarding specially for those starting a new career in this field.You have the best faculty here. You not just learn the tools of the trade you are walked through this course by one of the authority in the field.
5785,The video of reaching are really well done. Highly recommended course.
5786,Very thorough and practical. Great insight into the governance and leadership required in the nonprofit sector.
5787,Very enthusiastic instructor! Enjoyed and learned a lot. Thank you!
5788,"Thank you very much for this course! I learnt a lot, because the lessons were pretty clear and interesting."
5789,really good course. recommend it to all.
5790,"I am about to finish this course and I loved it. It is a great overview of the theories of SLA and although it says it takes 6 weeks, as I am on vacation now, I ended up finishing it in four days, working for about 4-5 hours/day. To, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in teaching languages."
5791,"Excellent course, straightforward and Or Severance has a great teaching style. Traumatic and clear. Thoroughly recommend this course."
5792,"I've always kept technology from my lessons until I took this course. His course has not only broken my fear in digital arena, but also has given me the tools and know-how to to implement Goodge on my blow. I thank Have, Austin and Jessica for enlightening me!"
5793,I learned a lot
5794,K as into to chinese language
5795,His class is not challenging at all
5796,"Of you are in love with history, western civilization, the Middle Last and everything related to the Woman Are Nostrum, you will not regret taking this MOOC. Those professors, lectures and scholars in charge of the course will not let you down."
5797,Very good course .
5798,Fantastic Course! I love it because the contents are simple and very well structures. For the most i love the simplicity and the way the instructor makes you follow along. Simply amazing! Thank you for such great course.
5799,"Thanks to everyone who participated in this course , i think this course was very helpful to me and i will benefit from it a lot in the future . also i have learnt a lot of information related with best technique in learning and also information about brain which i love to know about it more. this course will help me to change my life so again thanks to the staff of this course."
5800,to great learning experience and effort of faculty is recommended..so pupil has to work hard
5801,The course has helped me to open hearts and minds. Thank you
5802,"Very useful course. Met, as an electronics engineer, i felt it could have been better if it's even more detailed. Nevertheless, i strongly recommend this course to others"
5803,"excellent course, specially all the topics related to markdown, rubs. A must for each data scientist."
5804,"Informative, broken down into small, easy to grasp concepts. Very useful, can only recommend it."
5805,"One of the best courses I've ever taken. Concepts are very well and intuitively explained, but what makes this course even more valuable to me is the debugging part (week 6 in particular) and the numerous hints given by Or G. Thanks a lot Professor for putting this course together!"
5806,Excellent course - well worth investing the time for those looking for deeper skill in programming with Python
5807,Really GREAT course. The presented are ALL very interesting and this is a great condensed presentation of the topic. I wish everyone would take it!
5808,Great course!!
5809,"Very useful, but you need to have a good base English grammar knowledge. Magically-built, well-organized course. liked it!"
5810,I like it! really good module!
5811,Great course
5812,"It is a brilliant course for those who want to get an understanding of the principles of financial market, causes of previous crisis and main challenges in nowadays finance.Any thanks to the outstanding lecturer and Sterling professor Robert J. Miller for a spirited and effective style of securing."
5813,I learnt many things about Fig Data. Now at least I have some basic foundation in it.
5814,"I felt this course was well developed. It certainly captured some of the growing areas of information throughout healthcare. I would have liked to have seen a broader scale of examples such as how information is impacted other avenues of healthcare - such as in clinics, pharmacies, etc. There are several links in this course which are broken, so I was not able to do the additional reading on the sites I was being directed to. Overall, I felt the information discussed was direct and to the point and all of those who presented the material was helpful and knowledgeable."
5815,It was a wonderful journey with Or. Chuck! Thank you sir
5816,"Except for the last lecture on Jerusalem, I loved each and every lecture in the course. Also, the quires should have been a little longer, i.e. with more questions, at least 3-5 questions for each week."
5817,"A very interesting course, well document and explained by Or. Chamowitz ! I highly recommend this course, I learnt a lot !"
5818,A nice course to lay the advance foundations in accounting and finance.
5819,best course i've done on this topic
5820,"A really good both course!The teacher uses a simple way to introduce the Calculus knowledge to us!Thanks, Coursera!"
5821,Very good course for people getting stated in of
5822,I am taking the Digital Marketing Specialization and this has been the poorest course I have taken thus far. The instructor is obviously reading directly from a script because of her constant long pauses between words and how frequently she gets lost when presenting information. The also click to new sides and bullet points at the wrong time which is very disruption. The information presented on the sides really does not summarize what she is saying at all and I constantly had to refer to the transcribe to get the information I needed to write down.The assessment questions for this course are also quite poor and a lot of the time need to be further researches online. The quit questions also seem more involved than the lectures presented and can need some searching as well. I was looking forward to this course and I am disappointed. The instruction for this course seems like she does not the subject well enough to provide insight and quite possibly as if this is the first time she is giving a lecture/presentation.
5823,His is Programming made easy. By journey into the world of programming was launched by this course. Thank you for putting courses like this out there.
5824,great course thanks
5825,"Amazing course, it will help you be successful anywhere and in life itself"
5826,Great class!
5827,Thanks for the rich and well conducted course. It was very beneficial for me and I recommended it to my friends.
5828,"His course is an outstanding introduction to Web design technologies and tools. Is a backed developer, I was looking for a course to refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and this course went far beyond what I had hoped to learn -- even introducing me to some new tools, as well as filling in a lot of the background of WHY things work the way they do. By only criticism might be that the final week's assignment was not very difficult, and perhaps as a result, didn't force me to really study the material. Otherwise, I highly recommend this course, and I'm looking forward to taking the Angular course in this series. Thank you very much, Yakov, and John Hopkins!"
5829,"His ""should be"" a five star course. It is a great topic, with wonderful clips from moves and is well-written.Why only 3 stars then?For a class about film little was adopted from good storytelling and filling technique. The Prof plumped in his chair and clasped his hands in front of his chest for most of the course and spoke in a wisp, pedantic voice that made me uncomfortable in my body to listen to. I kept on wanting to tell him to sit up and breath and speak naturally! In top of that, the sound quality was simply awful!Of the Prof were to take some acting or presenting lessons and improvements to the sound quality were made (or a professional actor hired to present the material) it could be one of the best courses ever, but instead, it was hard to get through for me even though the material fascinate me as I'm learning neuroscience and love moves.The world of MOOCs are different than your old standard classroom style. Visual and auditory presentation really counts."
5830,"Very helpful information that I will use for the rest of my life, Am glad I found this course."
5831,Very educational. Maybe a short course in Miner Algebra could be included on Coursera also I have noted some of the assignment are a few years old as I have seen a few attempts to solve these on the web dating back to 2011. Maybe these should be changed to keep the ideas fresh.
5832,"a great course to learn bootstrap, query, less, pass and web tools like bower"
5833,I learned a lot!
5834,Excellent thoughts and concepts presented.
5835,Amazing class!! Very well done and I learned a lot!
5836,Outstanding instructor and well-designed learning materials. It was my best investment of my time in this machine learning course.
5837,The course that changes way of thinking. Thank you a lot for this.
5838,His course was great for developing new brain connections. It was sometimes frustration - In particular with the very limited discussion threads available on the forum (I wonder if it would be possible to merge forum threads between some runs...). But it was great introduction to get the brain started with functional programming and related Scala santa.
5839,"I am an undergrad Computer Engineering student, granulating from Lesson University. I found this course to be extremely intuition, well-organized, and extremely information. His is a must-have course for anybody interested in learning about Machine Learning both in general and in specific."
5840,Good introduction to patron programming and Or Chuck is just so enthusiastic - makes me laugh even while learning programming!
5841,It is a really good Marketing course. It is complete and very interactive course. It has a lot of interesting - real life- Cases that help you understand how is working the digital marketing nowadays. I recommend this course.
5842,"Positive: Headings and references allow for an additional study of related course concepts.Negative: Course is excessively short - both in number of nodules and also in resources per module. Quizzes are excessively easy. His course is basically a small part of a previous course in International Marketing in Asia. I think a new set of courses should have been presented and not this. Some of the concepts are excessively focused in Asia... Also the of interview video seem excessively of 'free' publicity. It should be avoided.Overall - in my opinion, to be relevant in the online you have to scale your game. Onset presents very short courses, as it can be seen in the specialization emerging technologies. Hope you can change your approach in the future or I don't think your courses will have traction. Please review your next courses in the specialization not to be parts of your previous course but to have new materials... I don't think is very incredible to slice a course and offering it in 6 parts and call it a specialzation.I wish you luck."
5843,Great course. Straightforward and enjoyable! Thank you guns!
5844,"I really enjoyed this course and the effort it put forth to open the dialogue of religion, science and philosophy. Thank you for creating a space to openly discuss belief."
5845,Very good! Everybody should see this course and try to get a better diet.
5846,Good course for beginners. you gain much knowledge from this.
5847,"It was a great course!I've been studying HTML before but now I had more structures knowledge, I've also discovered some new interesting things."
5848,"His is a really helpful course for learning information about Calculus two. However, some areas in explanations were confusing so I had to search more information from the internet and from other professors."
5849,Great course!
5850,"very helpful. I hope she there are more learning chinese course not for beginner, for higher lever"
5851,His is great course for both beginners and intermediate alike. Thank you.
5852,After acquiring 2 masters degree and beginning work on a decorate I have found a course that has taught me more than many of the courses that I have taken in person. Astronomy: Exploring Space and Time has been very well designed and taught.
5853,"Excellent course with good balance of theoretical foundations, relevant examples and tests."
5854,The course gave a clear introduction to unity with fast results which are motivation to go on. You get a hand on basic unity features and learn how build a simple interface.
5855,It was very helpful (: >>> thank you
5856,Wonderful course
5857,"Although some technical difficulties with situations, this course is more than interesting and I will definitely recommend it for those passionate about robotics."
5858,Insightful and enjoyable course.
5859,Systematic. Rousing on Basic Concepts. Good examples for earners.
5860,It's really good opportunity to learn more about the environment inside the work and how to deal with the problems in a professional way
5861,Great course! Very information. Thanks PWC and Coursera for this course.
5862,"The video are really tutorials on R functions for machine learning and data wrangling. A good substitute for ""Machine Learning"" by Andrew G in terms of managing data sets and exploratory analysis."
5863,Great introduction to angular.is
5864,"His course have very little to do with actual security. Most of the time you will hear about how to design applications, and what is a good design policy."
5865,Great course to learn about the various web tools for different purposes.
5866,I loved it so much.Pollen is a good lecturer and all she said i understood.
5867,It's just fit the engineer like me to take first step!
5868,"Both Challenging & rewarding, taught me basis of Tableaux, viz and comes."
5869,It's a very nice and easily understandable basic course.

5875,Very interesting and very well explained.
5876,"The programming assignment are challenging ( least for beginners),with each question taking about 3 hours to complete .Any topics in Hands are covered , making us reading the docs and finding solutions,that further helps in learning . Excellent course , good support from other earners taking the course and very very information . To other platform can give us a course ( and knowledge ) of this standard . Planning to take more courses from courseera . However a small feedback : The description for some questions are slightly confusing . Please make such questions more descriptive with examples ."
5877,"The team of proofs is great to listen to, even for hours on-end if/when going through several lectures per go...They have really worked through the online presentation of this software engineering 101 course to eliminate bags, streaming its effectively, and generally make it enjoyable for technical and laypersons alike.Buds Team Vice!"
5878,Great course!
5879,"Very useful in order to understand all the mechanism of the Global Financial Crisis. Need to be related to the new book of Men Bernanke ""The Courage to Act""."
5880,A very good introduction to machine learning concept and the algorithms.
5881,One of the best courses I have taken!Very good balance of depth and breadth of the material.

5897,this course is very interesting
5898,I think the course /whole specialization is really good. But I keep getting my paid toolkits really late. Only when I finished the course
5899,"His was a great course as an introduction to the Last Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Hopefully it is followed up with a more technical course. The only thing I don't care for with FHIR is they pronounce it 'Fire' which smack of cheese marketing. Nonetheless, the course is worth it, and the instructor is very clear and thorough."
5900,"Very well made course, although I wish to see more on other countries, because Gift, Israel and Palestine were making most of lectures."
5901,Very well organized lecture. It is rich in intuition and forms a nice first step for understanding of. Highly recommended.
5902,I love the practice exercises!
5903,"One of the best courses I have ever taken. Prof. Andrew G guides us through all the principles and shows the main algorithms for problems like stock predictions, photo OCR, classification and much more. It was definitely worth the investment!"
5904,Great course!
5905,"Great!! Thank You, so much Coursera!! I love you!"

5909,Great practice for theory achieved by 5 courses
5910,"Horrible quit questions. I found the distractions to be too similar to the answer, what is the point in having 4 possible correct answers?"
5911,I love the course format
5912,"I really enjoyed this MOOC, it gives a good idea of what to expect at school but also as a client. I didn't appreciate being evacuated about the nearby buildings of the school or the name of Sick's sister. Really not the type of thing that would make me chose one met over the other."
5913,It is excellent lecture to me.
5914,"Great course! i Learned a lot, but it had a lot more content about evolution than just dogs."
5915,A good hand-on course to initiate you into the world of Social Digital Marketing.
5916,Thank You for your knowledge
5917,Thank you very much! :-)
5918,"It can be made more information on theory side. The course is bit fast i guess or may be all the courses are like this only since this is my first course. But still i feel like things are going bit fast because I was not having any previous knowledge of data statistics or R language. However, giving some efforts on both sides I am happy with my performance. Thanks for the course."
5919,Very information--IMPOSSIBLY HARD FINAL EXAM though.
5920,In amazing course on the very fundamentals of how to learn. I am pursuing my doctor degree and I wish I had access to this course in the early days of my college or even better in high school.
5921,"The first course in this Specialization was very fulfilling and I've learned a lot in a short time, even though I had quite a bit of prior knowledge on some topics. The assignment were fitting and realistic, the instructor sympathy and the course was overall great."
5922,"Very education, but short. I'd love to see more. Thank you for the recipe in week 5!"
5923,"""Miracles of Human Language"" is a great introductory course for those who want to get into linguistic, but it is also an amazing course for writers, teachers, psychologist and all sidelong earners interested in a topic.I'm very grateful to Prof. Or Arc van Oostendorp, his students and everyone who was involved in creating this course. I also want to say thanks to course team for making this course available for so many earners.His course inspired me to start learning Spanish and French (I now spend some time on domingo.com every day, and with a great pleasure).Also, after finishing this course, I felt confident enough to start an important writing project (a book for children with a goal to prevent child abuse, the book is in Russian).In this course the idea of changing the world with your words is presented in such a simple and convincing way, that it's impossible to resist. I think this course made me a better teacher, a better writer and a happier person."
5924,"His course rocks! (no put intended). Great professor, fun and relevant content, and excellent presentation."
5925,Needed a step-by-step information sheet about what R Software and Tools need to be download with links.

5936,"Excellent course. Engaging, fun, thought-provoking, meaningful, blended learning experience the content of which is life changing. Highly recommend this course to all that will listen! Bravo Or. Happy Smart & Indian School of Business! Bravo!"
5937,"One of the assignment had wrong answers for some of the questions, which made passing it a bit tedious. Other than that, it was a fairly descent course."
5938,The course has been great and very vivid & well-chosen video materials!!!
5939,"Fantastic course! Prof Andrew shared the various concepts in a clear, succinct and easy to understand manner. The various relevant and practical examples also helped to reinforce my learning. Definitely well worth the time and effort!"
5940,"I learned to understand the structure of the algorithm, several codes are given only one solution, that with the support of cava, html, CSS can be visualized data to make minor changes to the code and change the visualization.Writing code Or. complicated but when we look at you see the familiar approaches to writing and take them to his application.Thank you!"
5941,"I like the content covered in the lectures. That's very useful for me to clean data passed from webpages. There is one thing I hope the course can improved, which probably has been mentioned in the forum for many times: the auto-grade is not flexible that it doesn't grant any points to answers that is slightly different from the submitted form (e.g. upper/lower cases, white space, etc.) and we have a hard time firing out what exactly the auto-grade is accepting. I would suggest edifying the auto-grade such that it allows flexibility in answer acceptance, or breaking down questions into smaller parts (more partial credits) and give more precise/detailed description on the format of answer expected."
5942,Very nice course. Not to slow and not to fast.
5943,His course gave me the knowledge I lacked to teach basic English to my Russian students
5944,North to learn
5945,His is one of the excellent course I have ever attend.
5946,"Another joyful Python course from Or. Charles Severance. Course were very dense, there was no boring details; give fundamentals, rest of it depends interest of the student. Also thanks for bonus video and interviews. Most of them are very inspiring. I understand from Or.'s courses that everyone seeing your job will enjoy if you enjoy by doing it. Thanks a lot."
5947,I like the classes!It was hard but it worth all your effort.See you on the next class!
5948,"Moved it. I took another class from Duke related to visual perception and was equally satisfied with the detail, and pace, of the course."
5949,Outstanding Python programming kick off thanks to Or. Chuck!
5950,"Simply Outstanding, my appreciation to Professor A and all his team. Very practical, evidence-based know how about such a subjective matter. Being happy is not that complicated and this course flaps you on the face on how easy that can be... Well done and Any Any thanks!"
5951,"Excellent for managers, engineers, entrepreneur and salesman!I recommend 100%. To matter where your are, Washington University will be there and they can help you to change your life!"
5952,good course to help me get organized
5953,"The course has a good structure. It covers interesting thomas. The assignment are easy to understand. It takes more effort than 3 or 5 hours/week, the nomenclature could be improved to be consistent. A couple of more examples would improve learning. The four week was hard ;)"
5954,tricky concepts and long equations yet fun
5955,"Enjoyed it a lot, very good lecturer! Like his book too. Definitely will recommend to other people"
5956,Very clear explanation and easy to understand.
5957,Excellent course. Especially for beginners!
5958,Short and effective course. Good information and practical advice. Would recommend to anyone interested in what they're eating and what they could be eating!
5959,"I like it and this reaches me a lot, really helpful."
5960,The course is organized in a way such that it helps a beginner to get a better understanding of Probability and Etats.
5961,A very information and enjoyable course. It is refreshing to see someone talk based on actual research rather than popular management of.
5962,The most explanatory MOOC I have ever sat! Deep up the good work!! Thank you for passing me all this WORTHFULL knowledge!
5963,Excellent course! One of the best programming courses!
5964,The course is awesome and we need more video to learn more about the content so clearly. I think lessons about coming in Atlas must be there for the beginners to get familiar with Atlas.
5965,It was the first course I passed completely. Thank you. It was joyful and information.
5966,Another great module.
5967,Good materials to start with web development
5968,very good，you will learn what you want .
5969,By thoughts on this course is that it is excellent and all teachers should have it.
5970,To far it's been very interesting course.
5971,I got a lot of knowledge from this course and I will continue learning more about guitar . And very thanks to tutor.
5972,"For better or worse, I’m a self-taught recording artist (lockup “On Anglo Frutorama” in Notify if you’re into lo-i psychedelic grooves) and I can fattest that the lessons given in this course are truly valuable and empirically veritable. In top of that, Stephen Member is a super liable guy who explains complex themes like reverberation, sound drooping or microphone types in a pretty straight-forward manner without ever being condescending. I especially liked his use of this famous quote attributed to Arson Cells: “The enemy of art is the absence of limitations.” and his advice on avoiding the pitfalls of digital audit. I also found very valuable the lessons about Identity, Vision and Intention and The Rule of Threes. Of you’re new to the world of music production or just someone who wants to fill some knowledge gaps as in my case, you won’t regret taking up this excellent course! Cheers from Madrid! On Anglo"
5973,"Very time one hear if you are not getting an interview call then it means your resume writing skill are not excellent, you are not able to project your self, you are not able sell your self or you might be overqualified / under-qualified. Of you ask them for help, 90% are not in a position to guide you, 9% would support you, provide some reasons, but you still you feel handicap. I am lucky to find my 1% who hold my hand and walked me through each stage , educated me with the explanation why to write like this way in must century.In my view it is the right time everyone must gain this skill of must century resume and cover letter writing . He need to overwrite now, the old traditional way of resume and cover letter writing.Thanks to Charles Coquette and Daniel C. Manner-Vera for making this excellent course easy to understand."
5974,Great!
5975,A very useful course
5976,West Course on Python yet on the WebDr.Charles Severance knows the subject and makes it so easy!
5977,"His course is excellent, not only do you get state-of-the-art information about how your brain works but lots of information on technique to use to minimize your learning, The instructor are so suppurative you feel confident taking this course. Sincerely Dog"
5978,"His course is wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. BUT, it is not well monitor, the peer review process is broken and questions are not answered, making it frustration. For example, I wrote an essay and received a non-passing grade. I re-wrote it and submitted it. The comments back were very good, but the grade remained a non-passing one. Very difficult to figure it out. I posted a request for clarification and received no response. To, course GREAT, administration of course, not so much."
5979,"His course gave me so much confidence not only in creating images and experimenting, but in writing too. I started to think out of the box and became more productive!"
5980,Love this course!I began this course at level zero and now I’ve be able to read and speak the language at a beginner’s level. I love to see Organ dramas and now I’m able to understand a lot of what they say. I hope the university develops a second part for this course.
5981,"Good course, really enjoyed it!!! A lot of tips and very complete process, before recruiting, recruiting, selecting, boarding and developing talent."
5982,The assignment and theory are interesting enough to get you started on world design.
5983,only I can say something. the teacher is great.
5984,The original and best machine learning course
5985,Very interesting and useful course.Thanks a lot !
5986,Great Course! Concise and well taught.
5987,The content and idea provided in the course are simply amazing! The best ever I had on Coursera and I really appreciate all the research effort made by Professor Merry Mehrling. Hope many more people using Coursera could have a look at the innovative ideas explained by Professor Mehrling in money market and finance.
5988,Good beginner course providing solid basis . Instructor is excellent
5989,"Great course, a good review and a good first step in learning more about the English language."
5990,That a wonderful course!!!
5991,It has add knowledge to me as I'm pursuing a law class
5992,"Great course for those eying for a quick know-how. Wouldn recommend it to those particularly interested in learning the mathematics behind the algorithms. Prof G is undoubtedly a great teacher, makes the concepts look simple and easy to understand. In short, I d rate 5/5 as an engineer and 4/5 as someone interested in the path."
5993,A good introduction to the course. Opening up quires to help feedback what we'd learned (for free earners) would have made the course much better!
5994,"Important note: Apt for this course only if you plan to do the entire specialisation. It is developed solely for the specialisation and not as a standalone course. You will not learn much concepts or theories or practice any R programming here.In general this course was basic and good enough to get someone started for specialisation. The video lectures for setting up R, studio and Github account were helpful and very basic ( maybe co I already had an github account)."
5995,"Very basic, and uninteresting"
5996,"Excellent course to gain macroeconomic fundamentals, even for people without economics background.Side range of questions in the discussion forum helps you clarify various queried you might have.Overall, i am very satisfied."
5997,Great into to the fundamentals.
5998,"Great class, I'm continuing on"
5999,Thank you so much for the most interesting course! I've had real pleasure taking it.
6000,His course was a great information course on the basis of market research and the market research model. I highly recommend this course for anyone who needs a refreshed on the the research methods involved in data collection and analysis methods used in the industry.
6001,Excellent Lectures on emerging technologies like Of and Of.
6002,Course Project is way outside of what was taught in class.
6003,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course. I think I must have virtually done it on my own as there were no other intervention, certainly in recent weeks. A very thought provoking course and all credit to the Professor and those who helped him put the course together."
6004,"I learn a lot from this course.The discussion below each video, it's useful. Through discussion, it's easy to get deep understood the course.Thanks you!"
6005,Useful course with well placed examples and explanation of technique by both the professors.Thank you very much.
6006,I found it one of the best course i have attended on the Cousera.
6007,Moved it! Excellent course brilliant Professor!
6008,The course is brief but intense and focused on key issues involving waste management.
6009,"His is a great course. It is challenging, but that comes with the territory if you want to write code. I like the fact that the assignment are challenging and long; the only issue I had is that I work full-time and hardly have the 20+ hours a week to spend on the programming assignment. Also, the estimated times listed for each assignment are not realistic for somebody learning the topics in this course for the first time. I would recommend this course to anybody wanting to learn how to develop web apes and apt web services using Nails with MongoDB as the backed. Must be prepared to dedicate a lot of time each week. Especially weeks's assignment. I ran out of time and had to transfer to a new session to complete the course because of my full-time job. It would be beneficial for students to have a spare week, in between the third and fourth assignment."
6010,Very helpful course. It's given me plenty of practical tools that I will adapt and use in my workplace. Thank you.
6011,excellent into to project financing and infrastructure investment. covers both quantitative and quantitative aspects.
6012,"The course, The Draft of Getting and Description, allows students to delve into the skill needed for polished creative writing. Amity Large was a great instructor who provided exercises and lectures that stretched my imagination. I really enjoyed this course."
6013,"Really good course, learned a lot of horrid development"
6014,His is very good course and It helped me a lot to enhance my basic knowledge in PYTHON.I would like to take few more courses from of on Python.
6015,Very nice course!
6016,Cry principles without real life examples and exercises. You can passed the quit by just reading online or have basic project management experience. Disappointed.
6017,"It's hard as hell, and very good."
6018,was a lot of fun
6019,I liked the way concepts are being introduced. I got a decent understanding of every algorithm that's been discussed and really looking forward to apply the concepts for some real time applications.
6020,it was a nice course and i enjoyed with the learning .
6021,"That's really a great course, even if we're at the starting point I anna vote and give a five star cause the first lectures were amazing"
6022,Great course and amazing video and lectures.
6023,"Very smooth, easy and gives a good insight in energy business."
6024,Very helpful session. The assignment are also challenging
6025,a little boring. I spent lots of time on learning on an useless language rather than learning the spirit of functional programming. I suppose to use C/C++\patron or other normal programming language as the lesson language.
6026,I am loving this course...It provides such a different perspective to memory. And explaining it with the moves makes it easy to relate and understand.
6027,"His course is helping me with my English as well as its giving me notions and concepts that will help me while i'll be setting up my own business. The lectures are excellent and make it easy for us students to learn. Anyone interested in both, English and business should start this course."
6028,"very high level syllabus, limited application description of of, poor quit and questions designed"
6029,"I enjoyed the course but mostly only because I had ample time to complete it. I likely wouldn't have finished if I was busier. The course notes aren't particularly helpful and they are very brief. The assignment were just okay but most of the time spent on them was trying to debut the code rather than learn the concepts studied in the lectures. I'm giving this course 4 stars, not because the Coursera content was good, it wasn't, but rather because I learned a lot trying to 'figure out' the assignment and finding information online. I'd say if you're a beginner, looking to step into robotics, it might be worth your time but if you're intermediate to advanced, you ought to move along. The content taught versus the time it takes to debut the codes might not be worth your effort."
6030,Clear and enthusiastically taught.
6031,"Clear explanations, good video, professional instructor and very useful complementing material."
6032,Finally. I know how to use punctuation correctly.
6033,A great option for learning about learning. Thanks a lot for the course.
6034,Great course and continuation to Into to Python
6035,West course for the bigenners
6036,His is really a time management class ~ an essential for anyone who wants to make the most out of their time!
6037,Life changing! Understanding the benefits of engagement and nurtured marketing strategics will completely change the way you market your company!
6038,A very good and well structures introduction to machine learning. I really enjoyed doing this course and its programming exercises.
6039,Great Course. I learned a lot!
6040,It was very interesting and knowledgeble
6041,"You can't have a ""Music of the Measles"" course without playing some of the music. Surely under the Hair Use provisions of the Copyright Act parts of the Measles music could be played as well as parts of YouTube"
6042,"Amazing course, Congratulations Or, One , Garden and others!"
6043,"Now this is a course to spend time learning! It's very well prepared in terms of material, it's useful and fun, and it provides ready to use skill I can immediately apply to my webster."
6044,His course taught so much more than just Python and so elegantly. Thank you.
6045,I will continue to come back to this course over and over again. Indispensable.
6046,It was so much fun to complete this course and I really learned a lot
6047,"His is a well taught introduction, especially for those who need a general view of what is needed for designing an of device."
6048,"There is some good content on creativity in this course, though it barely addresses problem solving.""To something different"" assignment were an interesting idea.Some content material is missing, including the link to a text that is needed to answer a quite which will influence your final grade.Trading standards are weird: maximum grades are to be given to assignment performed in public, as if things done in private aren't creative; there are better ways to have someone get out of their comfort zone. Assingments request that you be photographer or filled, and there is no disclaimer that your photo or your privacy will be protected. Of you are an introvert or simply a person who values privacy, this is not the course for you."
6049,it was harder than i have thought
6050,"valuable project, help you to put all the concepts together in a complete finished project."
6051,I've tried several other courses and this is the best one I have tried. The video are really clear!
6052,I thoroughly enjoyed the course.
6053,By jaw dropped at the gun field. Amazing!
6054,"Hello.I found this course very useful, it has allowed me to know what types of things I should look for in food, diversity my family's eating habits and to have fun in the kitchen,Regards."
6055,"By only complaint is the lack of vectorization in many of the lectures. I understand that linear algebra may be foreign to many programme, but the tutorials which vectorize made the course much more clear. Overall, this is a great course."
6056,"Plus: Lots of information for a beginner course, covers a lot of ground in HTML/CSS/of. Some applications requiring building web-pages and of programs to get hands-on experienceNegative: HTML/CSS and to a less extent of introduced pretty much as a list of disconnected tags/attributes etc, leaves some confusion as to how it all fits together, but that probably can't be avoided when covering a lot of ground in a short 3 weeks beginner course"
6057,"Great Explanation, and very useful to modify certain mindsets. I think that the book should be complementary to this course, eventually with more detail?"
6058,Great one
6059,"Very well structures, great lecture-video with experts in their field. Love the vagrant discussion forms as well where i get to learn more about different education cultures from all around the world. By only one criticism is that it became to predictable - pre-lecture activity, lectures, discussion forum, reflection. rise. repeat. thought perhaps the learning, and maybe the assessment could have been diversified more? Instead of personal reflections, maybe we could do reflect on case studies?"
6060,"Vice, but demands hard work."
6061,"Great course, I've learned a lot!"
6062,"Absolutely love the course, and I'm learning so much."
6063,"A practical way to get you started to enhanced learning, or maybe, to simple learn what you want."
6064,Great course Great Instructor
6065,Great!
6066,very good and very didactic.Deep pushing
6067,"Excellent course, well presented and easy to understand and follow! Very recommended as Introduction into of!"
6068,"His course is totally recommended for developer and architects no matter the programming language you use.In my opinion, the only thing that I missed was a project for the penetration testing week.Contents are very well reached and the interviews were awesome."
6069,"Very interesting, original, motivation, thought-provoking and fun. I started the course on a Friday night and it was the best entertainment ever!"
6070,Professor was passionate!
6071,"Super course, clear in the theoretical analysis, good practice quires and interesting virtual lab exercises."
6072,Hands down the best patron course I've come across. I look forward to completing this series.
6073,Very practical and immediately useful.
6074,Round this course very useful as a teacher.
6075,"Excellent course with engaging speakers, and a good community."
6076,"I'm dropping out of a specialisation I paid for because the quality of the materials is really low, and the presentation is very similar. I don't want to discourage the presented, but this is not the level I expected."
6077,"His course was very helpful to me. By grammar and writing style has definitely benefited from taking this course. The nodules were clear and well-paced, and the practice quires were relevant."
6078,"Easy to be followed: it offers references for further reading, the video are easy to understand and we can always use the subtitles. To previous background on Management or Finance required. It was the first course I ever got to finish on Coursera and it will be the first of many others."
6079,Very professional & helpful
6080,"His course is very insightful with useful tools. Especially helpful are those analogies, which are super vivid and sticky in your mind. Highly recommended!"
6081,"They put a lot of effort into this course, but especially for the video it was a bit too much. To many different visual background, sounds, music, text floating it... It's as if they just wanted to use everything, while never thinking about when it would start being too distracting."
6082,His course is very useful for those who want to start his diving to machine learning problems. It is a great opportunity to study on this course. Thank to Andrew for these video and programming exercises.
6083,The materials are very interesting. Great introductory course. There are a few problems that need workaround if you are using Amazon AWS to complete the quit. Need some FAQ section for people who are using Amazon AWS. Wish there are some documents reference patron/learn. Excited to take the deeper course but need to upgrade the computer instead of using AWS again.
6084,"I love how this course contextualizes each programming concept, instead of presenting it in a vacuum as other programming MOOCs I've attempted have done. I'm very thankful for this course."
6085,"It's wonderful to have an instructor who is so passionate about what he reaches that you can actually see and hear it. I was engaged in every lesson, and there was never a dull moment with Or. Kellogg. The only reservation I have about this class is that it should've been longer!"
6086,A very interesting course! I learned a lot. Will continue on the next course once it ready.
6087,It was really good and information to know about history of Internet and people who invented it. Really nice!
6088,His could be huge for me!
6089,wonderful experience!
6090,The course is very well organised.Ideas are clear and precise.Not too much talk to say a little.
6091,did this a while ago was education

6093,"Very interesting and useful course, thank you very much!"
6094,"His was a good course,Professor Risk did a great job of using relevant case material to highlight course objectives. His was my first course course that I signed up for and completed. Great way to be ""introduced"" into the MOOC program."
6095,"I benefit from this class a lot, Thank you of!"
6096,"Matthew is really good and takes you through the stuff at a good pace. There are some difficulties with the code sometimes because of more recent versions of Peter etc. However, these are solved in the forms. Also, any difficulties force you to go and find out and experiment a bit so that was actually great."
6097,I like this course very much
6098,_ thorough introduction to up-design . great course .
6099,"Quite good and interesting course, I would probably add a bit more diversity is presentations, tasks etc. But even as it is now it gives a very good insight."
6100,Very Easy
6101,"His is the best introductory course I took about of. Real problems with real data and all done in Jupiter. Each week has a theory section with a test at the end and then a practical part where to apply all the knowledge learnt.Thanks to all the team, specially to Parlor Guestrin and Emily Box for your enthusiastic way of teaching (you did a great job)."
6102,excellent course! I really enjoyed it and learned a lot...
6103,"Pretty well structures class, but quite expensive considering very limited lectures and assignment that are mostly ""find your own challenge on the internet""."
6104,"You can't get any more generous than this course. It gives you tons of knowledge, tons of practice, tons of meaningful projects to do.Of you have started this course a beginner and have since then religious following the course materials and activities, you'll emerge an intermediate level developer who will be on the right track to building more advanced web applications."
6105,VERY VERY INTERESTING AND INFORMATIVE I LOVE THIS COURSE

6116,"Well thought out, although some of the work and links were unteachable."
6117,In AMAZING course for beginners. Is a highschooler not pursuing biology in school this was still pretty easy to understand and enjoy (the reason I started it). Highly recommended for people wanting a light introductory course to genetic and a bit of evolution and those who can't take out too much time for doing an intense course.
6118,"One of the best course I have taken in Coursera. Very well structures, the professor makes every concept looks really simple. The assignment are the best part, they give us the confidence you need to start designing your own responsive front-end web application from scratch. The level is suitable for beginner and mid-level."
6119,It's a must-take course ! It will fantastically change your whole life
6120,"It's K, nothing much to gain in terms of knowledge related to saber conflict."

It the introduction, it is explained on how to have a useful discussion on such a delicate subject.With so much information and facts given, one can develop their very own opinion on this Animal Welfare.I find it very important to cover Animal Welfare for anyone, who works with any kind of animals.Alongside this course I studied Cognition and Basic Horse Management. Soon I will be starting Hairy Arm Management and Horse Nutrition."
6142,equally excellent experiencewould request if you could please share sides of all the courses it will help for future reference
6143,"Or. Chuck has explained patron in a very simple way to learn and practice. Thanks Or. Chuck for unmask, organize a way to teach patron in such easy way of learning."
6144,"His is a super beginner's level course--perfect for the super beginner. I recommend it. Also, I had taken some other into-level web design courses previously, and I found that this course still taught me useful tips that I didn't know before. I recommend it for those who want to cement their knowledge of HTML5."
6145,it is very very useful and interesting Important for both leaders
6146,"i love it, thanks for the great work,"
6147,Thank you for very fruitful course!
6148,"His is the best course in of. But to start in of this shouldn't be the first place you should go, first do the 'Into to of' in Audacity then come to this for better understanding of baths."
6149,"very interesting, easy to learn though you might have challenges if you are new to programming. but its not bad at all, try it!"
6150,It is a interesting course full of examples that makes the learning easy for anyone.
6151,"His course is absolutely amazing! I took it because I was feeling kind of moody in a regular basis and that made me very unhappy. The topics covered in the course made me understand how we do so many things that go against our happiness and made me think about my own situation and why I was getting upset about silly things.I also found very interesting the focus of the course. I was worried it may be new age, happy happy kind of affair, but it is very well structures, organised and all the facts are based in research, not on believes.Happy, moody, sad... I'd recommend this course to everyone, there is plenty to learn and to understand for all of us.Thank you Prof. A!"
6152,Very Happy to learn about Eyes. Expecting for More Articles
6153,His is a good course to set up for further learning. One gets exposure to topics in into and intermediate statistics and starts to grasp how intricate the web of statistics it all the while the focus is on Hypothesis testing which is one cornerstones of statistics.
6154,Good content. Impressive style of teaching. Thanks for such wonderful and valuable course
6155,"awesome, very good explained, and very enjoyable"
6156,His was best course till I took Machine Learning from University of Washington
6157,"Quick overview of the Arduino platform. Since I was new to Arduino, it helped me gather key concepts quickly and effectively. The peer-reviewed trading process is something that can be improved.I think the course should have covered some more concepts in detail that are relevant to of devices - for example, interrupt and their usage, detailed discussion of the SPI protocol.Also, more elaborate treatment of how to implement security in communication over internet with Arduino would have been great."
6158,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course. I was hearing about Machine Learning so much that i decided to see what the big buzz about, and big it was! Now i have some of the ideas for my own projects and some solutions for old problems. And must i say that the instructor are amazing, really love their job! Will definitely use graphlab in my work from now."
6159,The course appears unfinished and very disorganized. The lectures are monotonous and boring.
6160,The course reaches you very valuable basic R programming skill. It is definitely good for the beginner. Unfortunately the lectures and course materials do not adequately prepare you for the programming assignment which is frustration and time consuming if you actually want to write the code required and not cheat.The structure and functionality of Coursera itself is excellent.
6161,"I liked this course a lot as it gave me the opportunity to work doing the assignment, helping me to think as an executive team leader. It was very challenged but very rewarding at the end of it."
6162,It can improve a lot.
6163,The course is reached with good humor and an easy to understand method. Congratulation Or. Chuck.
6164,Great introduction course for machine learning.
6165,Very good course with very good explanation of concepts.
6166,"West of the best. Great instructor and materials. I finished all 4 classes of the series, which tells you how much I enjoy learning from this instructor."
6167,excellent format and presentation
6168,Impressive analysis. His will truly push the intelligentsia to understand the core problems and ask questions.
6169,Good. I've learned a lot. Thank you.
6170,"Really nice course, in my opinion it could be some more stuff about how really SVM works,but it's great, anyway."
6171,"His course help easy way to learn patron for useful things like REST API consumption, that nowadays are very important."
6172,"Great course, complete with interactive activities to review our knowledge in Grammar and Punctuation!"
6173,"I loved the course, it was really dynamic and descriptive."
6174,Not well designed and the professor hard to follow...
6175,"It was a good course ,That's amazing.Very time increase my passion for learning"
6176,"There could be more assignment (maybe more complex, or with different output) to fix the knowledge of the video lectures."
6177,"For those absolutely new to programming, this course covers the core foundations of programming and is taught in a very unapproachable fashion. I was pleased to see there was an introduction into what is occurring ""under the covers"" - solid into to CPU, Memory, peripheral and how programs/software utilize these resources."
6178,Teacher is very clear and the course contents are very good. His course is highly recommendable to any who is interested in crept.
6179,Informative with lots of additional resources.
6180,Very logical and clear approach. Brilliantly explained.
6181,"Great to start with Ableton, even i start with some couture tutoring, this course really works for me cause i can see some errors i did."
6182,perfect course ever，It's a good choice for new learner to study!R <- best language!
6183,"I really enjoyed the class. The video were interesting, entertaining, and educational."
6184,"Easy to follow, great introduction to topics. Very good to have a quick overview of interlacing with Arduino"
6185,His is the most friendly course i have ever had. The course is very useful for beginners with no background in programming and those who want to understand the behind the scenes part of the WWW.
6186,Useful and straight to the point.
6187,"The course will be difficult for those who have no musical training. I enjoyed the course, though I often wished Or Right didn't play the piano himself as wrong notes spoil the impression. I'm also puzzled why a renowned musician like Robert Blocked plays Hoping's prelude in C minor wrong. Thank you for the course, Pale."
6188,"Script Writing: Write a Pilot Episode for a of or Web Series is a very challenging course. However, if you goal is to write a of Pilot, this is"
6189,"Excellent explanations however, should be sure of do not make comparisons with other programmatic languages since it cause confusion"
6190,"Great course on machine learning, however, left us in middle of learning, Recommended System + Deep Learning Capstone is missing"
6191,"Some interesting ideas. Unfortunately some of the presentation was so poor that it was impossible to work out what points, if any, were being presented. And for a course called ""Science and Philosophy"" there was far too much religious and/or anti-science content."
6192,"Great course, professor is explaining problems very clear and full of sense of humor. Strongly recommended!"
6193,It was a very great experience to have this course. this has given me a lots of things to gain. I thanks to course and group for p
6194,Great course!!Great explanations of Or Matthew!!
6195,"It's a little difficult for us frenchman, but I also feel excited when accomplished every chapters. Very nice course!"
6196,"Definitely, the widest and the most exciting course I've ever seen. It's so impressive how friendly and thoughtful John is, clearly understandable and accurate in details (especially for me as non-native speaker), which make this course above any rating. Thank you a lot, John!"
6197,Or. Chuck is awesome!
6198,"His class was very helpful in better understanding the nutritionnal values off various foods and how to best prepare them. It covers a wide variety of food related issues, such as the ago-industry, food safety, antibiotics, pesticides... and helps in taking informed decisions when preparing nutrition meals."
6199,very useful and helpful
6200,Very Enjoyable! Interesting ideas for successful learning. Thanks!
6201,Very good course!
6202,His is great course to introduced in Machine Learning. The way of teaching is awesome..
6203,Learned so much about my ability to learn
6204,I love the way this course is presented online. Easy to navigable and allows me to focus on the material.
6205,Great course. Great elector! Would be nice to have more courses like this.
6206,Great and highly information!
6207,Absolutely excellent. I learned so much and it has the right depth compared to courses that only offer usage information machine learning tools or others of similar level but not offering hands on programming.
6208,"The first 3 weeks demonstrate how to analyze financial performance based on accounting data taken from a company's reported income and investment decisions (10-K for example). The material is presented in an interesting manner with extensive use of Expel spreadsheets to demonstrate the calculation and application of common performance merits and ratio. The test are challenging and interesting. I betook test I had passed because the information cover was interesting and the test provided an excellent learning opportunity. The fourth week deals with liking non-financial measures to financial performance. Within a typical organization, these parameter are often the ones employees most affect and are often measured against. The concepts and methods of evaluation presented with examples to demonstrate some of the problems with linking non-financial measures to financial performance.I will be able to use what I have learned from both of these classes in my current job. I evaluate current business strategics of my company against competitive business strategics. Since the competitive business strategics must be deduced from a combination of published information and reported financial performance, the first three weeks will be of greatest benefit in this aspect of my job. The last week will be of more benefit as I help business organization within my company develop their business strategics."
6209,Fantastic course and a wonderful teacher. Really grown in my programming ability.
6210,It was a really fun course. I Learn a ton even though was already familiar with the topics covered.
6211,"It is a really fruitful course, it quite challenging and fun."
6212,Excellent but a little bit intense and high-required course! Like it!
6213,"it is a great course!!! For me, it is an excellent opportunity for learning about others languages..."
6214,"Very good course for beginners, but some of the practical examples could have been done better.For example it would have been nice if the course had taught how to execute of code directly from a webpage, with or without using CodePen.His is the only reason why it gets 4 stars instead of 5."
6215,Good but not so deep as I expected.
6216,Interesting course however the webster is very slow and can be hard to log into at times.
6217,The best course on negotiations.
6218,Very good course.
6219,face course got a brief idea about agriculture by one of the renowned teacher David Pannell sir
6220,loved it!! thankyou so much :)
6221,"I'm not a graphics designer and will apply the new knowledge in perspective of of solutions design and presentation. The course perfectly fits my needs.His introductory course provides the fundamental principles and general design tricks in condensed and very clear form.Major ideas are defined in several best practices supported by relevant examples and engaging exercises.I like the idea to deliver graphics design, writing, and presentation courses together with references between related topics. Such politic approach gives us the better view on real ""design of everything.""Great job David!Thank you"
6222,nice explain from Or. Chuck
6223,"may been curse, appendix sin tender bases de marketing"
6224,The class is interesting and good teacher
6225,I love the teaching style of Prof. George W. Vessel (Or.). It makes the overall learning even more enjoyable. War training and the final assignment are very good for developing foundation of musicianship. Assignment also help to learn how to write your own composition. Looking forward to the next course.
6226,His course is a great introduction to music theory. I have been playing by ear for a long time and i now finally understand some of the things that i did before. I recommend this course to those that one to get a good foundation in music.
6227,"Great course. I learned a lot of valuable information I can use in my work. The course is not for the beginner. West if you already have exposure/experience with HTML,CSS, and javascript. Still then you'll need to do your own on-line research. 5 Stars +"
6228,Very good course. Fig thanks to instructor.
6229,"Pretty good course that introduces a lot of useful tools and the concept of reproduciblity. However, it is not quite as applicable as the previous courses for those who are individual contributory in the private sector and rarely have others double check their analysis or need to publish anything."
6230,Really interesting and excellent course! Very educational. I will miss Or. More and Ana when I knoll a new course after I finish this one.
6231,Excellent course!! It helped me a lot to review my time management at work.
6232,so interesting helping me to improve my basis
6233,"I was very excited during Week 1 and Week 2 lectures. When, the video kept getting unclear and outdated. The assignment is not engaging. By interest dropped. The video really need updated!"
6234,Great course!
6235,That wonderful course!
6236,"Good course, I took it as a free user and really liked the material it's very simple and easy . will taken only a few his to complete"
6237,"I, I am an of specialist (30 years experience). I undertook the course so I could learn about IBM Bluemix and of development, and extend my skill/understanding of the environment. However, I have very little good to say about this course offering. I had numerous issues with what was offered:The video were generally ok, but some had poor audit. There was minimal video (compared to any other course I have done), and more detail and discussion in video would have been more helpful.Some of the video material is out of date already, as I suspect Bluemix layout has changed - this made navigation a bit confusing.The downloadable I image has changed since the course was prepared, and the newer image has different code as standard. I ended up having to muddle-through mentally loading packages and dependencies, etc. to get things to work.I lost many hours trying to debut and work assignment code, just to get it to work for the grade tool. His was further complicated by not having good debut output from the grade to work with. Naturally some of the grade fails were my own fault, but the majority of issues I ran in to could have been avoided by better worded assignment and/or more detail about requirements.Lastly, it was taking sometimes days to get any response to requests for guidance on the forms / discussions. In fact, I think the majority of useful assistance came from other students who had run in to the same issue(s). When you have a course that is such a short time frame, you really need to be providing assistance in a timely manner.I could not, in any good faith, recommend anyone take this course in the future - which is a little maddening. I do thank the lectures for their efforts thus far, and sincerely hope they can either improve or drop this course offering in the future."
6238,Sides from previous version of the course Reactive programming in Scala makes this course worse prepared. I had impression that it was made rushed from shrouded pieces. Assignements are easier than previous
6239,Very useful. Good recipe and tips.
6240,I love this course
6241,Great introduction to real independent game design and production. It let you build games since day one.
6242,this is amazing course. i really got high benefit of it. thanks course . thanks my lectures.
6243,"i enjoyed this course its very benefiting , i didn't fee like i was taking a course , more like taking tips from someone who cares so much about me"
6244,"Very good course! I have tried different coming classes online, to differing degrees of success.His course had 2 benefits in my eyes:1) Realistic, yet actual deadline. Self-paced stuff is great too, but its also good to have a certain time that assignment need to be done.2) It helps you set up de environment! Hard to find good walkthroughs of that. His class has walk-through in the beginning, but you also do it a few times throughout the course."
6245,"His was my best 11 weeks ever. I got really a lot here from Andrew. I was glad to have this opportunity of learning advanced technology and completing some examples for application. Thanks a lot! And thank you, Andrew, for Machine Learning Course and this webster Coursera! It is literally an incredibly amazing place for studying."
6246,"Awesome teacher, awesome course."
6247,"great course, they start from 0"
6248,His course introduces the topic in interesting way and should be checked by anyone interested in healthy nutrition and eating habits not only for kiss.
6249,Very impressive ！
6250,His course provides excellent learning technique to achieve efficiently. Also these technique apply to any field of study.
6251,Very nice course indeed!
6252,I loved the course and the professor's didacticism! I hope more courses like this and more specific courses arise! :)
6253,Very good course. I knew nothing about angular before and now I'm at least familiar with it. Yakov explains things in an easy to understand way.
6254,Wonderful course to learn Server-side coming. Again Thanks a lot to Jogesh K Muppala for explaining each every topic very clear.
6255,"His course included a ton of useful information, even for non-marketing business professional who work with markets. I also began to understand the waterfall release cycle my company uses more through this course."
6256,"Good job! It's an interesting and easily understood course for people like me who hasn't learnt before the competition strategy. Must a suggestion, could you please change the translated quit into the original english quit? Maybe it would be better to fellow and solve the questions. Thanks."
6257,"Very good introduction to project management, gives indeed the fundamentals!"
6258,"Very educational, I learned a lot."
6259,A classic course! Eager to do the next part.
6260,"The professor spends LOTS of time doing really, really simple work -- over-explaining things, to be honest, in such a way that makes them more confusing. When he does not explain much more complex issues throughout the course. Very frustration, even as someone who has taken calculus before and is just taking this as a ""refreshed."""
6261,"Well paced and explained, also relatively useful suction in life, highlight rather extensively on the subject."
6262,"Excellent course, very crisp and to the point explanation....examples use"
6263,"I learned a lot. Now I need to study the legislation of my country to apply, with the knowledge acquired in this course, and help to improve our world for the next generations."
6264,"I've been a supporter of environmental sustainability efforts for a long time, however, I lacked training/knowledge (as my undergraduate studies are in Business). Passion is great, but in the real world, you need skill to back up that passion. I am proud to say that can now engage in active conversations with people who are working in sustainability related fields! His is a very empowering course!"
6265,One of the best courses I ever studied about music
6266,excellent very useful and adaptable to different realities.
6267,"Andrew G's Machine Learning class was five stars! The course had a very good balance of depth, examples, and exercises. Prof G always seemed to know where more explanation was needed and always provide intuitions to help understand the material."
6268,Excellent information
6269,"The material and presentation are at the highest level, but the course is lacking real life examples, and contents."
6270,His course will just give overview and will be easy for only those who have some prior knowledge in programming.Anyone new to programming will have a hard time to get everything.Anyway it was least very helpful for me.
6271,Great !!!!
6272,"The course is very good, but I was missing a piece of installation and configuration of mon and XNA in Visual Studio 2015 Community"
6273,very useful course and the teaching quality is excellent.
6274,I recommend this course to everyone who study something. It opened my mind to my potential and enjoying learning ever more. The way this course is structures makes it easy and fun to learn as well.
6275,"The calculation is kind complex because the professor just gave the results. In all, it is detailed and enriched."
6276,"Very challenging, the lecture are really deep and could be improve ..overall really helpful!"
6277,A brilliant course and very interesting course. Very well taught! The combination of fundamentals and matas exercises are just right (although cannot help to thinking that there must be a better way to choose Up and Iv than what I ended up doing .. trial & error ... you will know what I talk about if you take the course! ;-).
6278,Course and instructor are awesome.
6279,"It is easy to follow, it should be a 2 week university course, but IMHO it should cover more about the data type problems that can arise with R loose data types. It is rousing too much on the code profile concept without leaving interesting knowledge about that. It should cover better the native idea/implementation about amputation as single instruction multiple data, which is not well covered. In the end, this is one interesting aspect of the language that makes it useful for data science."
6280,"Was been profitable, for intelligent work, professional use, Congratulations"
6281,Amazing course. Highly relevant for the fundamental knowledge of markets and trading in them.
6282,His is going great so far!
6283,It's amazing experience. I had the opportunity to get access to new knowledge
6284,Learning how to create a tidy Data set was one of the peaks in this course
6285,I really enjoy this course. Everything is so clear.
6286,"The best path course online. The format is great, and professor Fowler is a terrific teacher."
6287,Good overview of forming Data science team. The challenges are typical of any SDLC project. However I was looking to clean some specific challenges between c team and product or marketing tears.
6288,His course helped allot by which I learn more in Cryptography. Thank you very much for providing an excellent opportunity to learn this course.
6289,"great class, very information"
6290,"Still very good course with a lot to offer especially parts covering new methods. The only downside for me were the mathematical parts by Martin which got complex, mess and seemed to be explained not as clear as in previous course. Some economical, more experiment related examples could be useful to help understand mathematical operations and formula."
6291,"It needs project based exam, not quires. These project exam should be a combination of automatic programming tasks, like the kind you find on HackerRank or Codeforces and peer assessment based projects that asks students to evaluate the reliability of each others code. Is it currently stands, this course is a joke."
6292,In amazing course for those who are not very familiar with statistics and a very refreshing perspective for those who actually knows statistics!
6293,Good for an international perspective on Saber Conflicts. Covers a wide range of topics
6294,it is a very good courses. I learnt a lot about how to build a phylogenetic tree here.
6295,Excellent. I learned so much in this course. Thank you!!
6296,"In-depth, I really enjoyed it."
6297,"Once upon a time, Alarms was my glad school, and I got the MFA gladly. Years later, I needed to up my skill, and I discovered Coursera had many of the classes I wanted to take-- and now I feel like my MFA is an MFA+. His course is very good for both the writer and the game maker- and more to the point- it is a great breakdown of what is a good storytelling device. Highly recommended."
6298,Good for learning JavaScript!
6299,The way Or of gives the mathematical intuition to each of the machine learning algorithm makes me come back to the course. I have already earned a 95% certificate previously and I have come back to take the course.
6300,Key points that transcend social media to find a place in everyday life successes
6301,Great practice for R programming and the MySQL part is extremely helpful for my work.
6302,A very good course. Of you want to learn about Front-And Web of Framework and Tools then this is the best source for you. The instructor is so awesome and his teaching methods are very comprehensive.
6303,good course
6304,it was a really good course..i had learned a lot from this course.:)
6305,To far this is the best on-line course I have attended about leadership.
6306,"very interesting and amazing, I had fun to enjoy this course. Thank You!!!"
6307,Excellent course and teaching lessons the examples are according the video and the teacher has a lot of patience explaining everything with details.
6308,His course is very interesting and useful. I'm glad with the knowledge.
6309,It is great course! It's information and I love the lecturer's smile.
6310,It's the best course I've ever taken! His is what every educated person with a college or university diploma should know and this information partially should be obligatory in junior and senior years in high schools.
6311,"Generally a good course. I was disappointed with the instructions in the Week 3 assignment. In past courses within the mortification, the instructions have noted specifically what was required. Were, the instructions around the Google Business Age part of the assignment did not include some specific elements we were being evacuated one."
6312,Very Good Course and well taught by Prof Andrew G
6313,The course is well designed and well deployed. The objective is to prepare the learner for the HSK exam. May attention to every lecture all the dialogue and build a course specific vocabulary/phrase notebook. Listen to every possible source of spoken Mandarin language that you can so you'll be prepared for the voices you'll hear in the course final. May attention to the format and layout of each 'practice' quit that's going to be your orientation for the course final and the HSK exam. I'm going to improve my final grade score and then move on to the next sections of this mortification course...James.
6314,Thank you for the great possibility to learn R :-)
6315,Very well presented!
6316,very practical introduction to Python programming
6317,Or. Right did a excellent job in presenting the material in a manner that was both information and highly engaging. His unique take on office hours is the best I've ever seen. Great course...
6318,Good thought provoking class. A good foundation class to take before taking the MySQL or Tableaux or Expel states classes.
6319,Really good introduction to cry-of and of in general!
6320,It's amazing course!!!
6321,Great presentation style. Only recommendation would be to make the sides available for download.
6322,Great course and the teachers motivate us. I find a lot of information about learning and how to improve things in my life too. It is well explained and the video are very clear. I have also improved my english very much through this course :-). Thanks for this.
6323,Very useful and lucid taught by a very learned person. Thanks
6324,"Almost without exception, the best courses of my life have been those that were built by an extremely knowledgeable professor bringing in diverse and original sources of material and organizing them in a unique way. His is one of those courses."
6325,"The course is related with language and logical analysis , so it's a little hard to learn because my English is very poor."
6326,In outstanding series of presentations. It was a truly fascinating course to follow.
6327,The best MOOC programming course i have seen. THANK YOU!
6328,Very fundamental things that all data scientist must learn. You will know how useful of data.table and duly package.

6332,His is a very educational course.I came to know about various facts and this course is very helpful if you have your your interest in universe.all the points are explained in a very good manner.I thank professor Djorgoviski for this course.thanks catch.
6333,Excellent Introduction to Machine Learning. The hands on programming assignment are the best!
6334,Does not teach Expel very well while trying to apply the basic usage instruction to not too difficult problems. The ability to interface with Expel after some knowledge of Python/R or other programming languages would be helpful in the Data Science programming that is increasingly being promoted.
6335,"Course was helpful in giving a structure to think deeply about a difficult, nebulous topic as is influence. Appreciated all the tips and tactics"
6336,"Thanks George Seidel, professor,T"
6337,"Amazing course, amazing instructor: Yakov Chaikin! Everyone who wants to improve their fronted skill should take this course. It is inquire, concise and very clear! And the instructor is AMAZING and FUN!"
6338,Awesome course. I've already become
6339,Headed downhill. Lessons are starting to feel like not enough time was put into preparation... or like this course was assigned as a project to some students so the professor could make a dollar (like textbook). One of the instructor even said at one point they didn't have enough time. That does that even mean in an online course. You could be fixing it right now and improving the course. His whole thing is being handled like a college course and that is crazy. In-line courses can undergo continual improvement. The college course paradise is dying because we can do it better now. Nail.
6340,Need allot of improvement
6341,Exceptionally good! Thanks a lot Or. Right!
6342,Funny and Directly involves the audience which is great!
6343,A really nice guide to machine learning. I've starting seeing myself as a machine which was programme with some algorithms to predict the accuracy of a particular decision and therefore humans are so much intelligent and best at their work. They learn like machines do. They have prediction models built inside them. Thank you for this knowledge.
6344,Excellent course that opened what I had never known to be in existence.
6345,Great Course including great compilation of concept and question.
6346,"The course provides an overview on classification methods in machine learning.The lectures are clear and easy to understand due to the quality of the sides and of the explanations.The limit of this course lies in the assignment: too easy if done with the provided notebook and tools. Sometimes impossible to do with different tools (the suggested machine learning package is free for educational purposes, but otherwise it needs a license)."
6347,"Vice, but not the best."
6348,Really interesting
6349,"Are you a struggling programme? Someone who doesn't know how to install software via command line? Not experienced with GitHub? Of any of those describe you then this is not the course for you. The professors seem to create an environment where if you are too new to anything, then you should take a different course(even though every module has ""introduction to .."" in the title). Does Coursera offer introductory courses to Ruby or Ruby on Nails other than this ""introduction"" course? To."
6350,Very nicely put together course with straight forward examples and well thought out assignment.
6351,I found this course is really important and good. Most valuable takeaway is making you think about other people who will look / challenge or derive your analysis. Looking at work you are doing from this perspective lets you keep things in order and stay as transparent as possible.
6352,A nice and well constructed course...pretty simple and powerful...
6353,very good organized course
6354,"Excellent examples and lectures. Deal for conductors, but also helps develop general musicianship."

I would recommend this course to gain an understanding of traditional and newer advertising strategics employed by companies."
6357,Very Informative. A practical approach to daily life and food choice. Really appreciate May Adams and Michael Collar for their immense knowledge and practical advice.
6358,Awesome! Of you are a singer songwriter you need this knowledge!
6359,"A great course to get started with programming in general and with Python in particular.Is stated in the abstract, this course is addressed to those who have no experience in programming. However, even if you have some experience but are not familiar with Python (as it was my case), you can take this course quickly (speed x.50) in order to learn the basic santa of Python and catch up for the following courses in the specialization.Really clear teacher. Highly recommended!"
6360,His course is missing content but it is still very interesting to work on the exercises provided.
6361,"I am enjoying the course. It not just helps me to improve my Spanish, but gives me a chance to discover new side of the book I love so much.Thank you!"
6362,"I learned a lot from the course on how to make develop your idea & sense as an Artist/ Humanitarian. I can see the world through a viewfinder for the love of light!

6368,great introduction to relations database with patron
6369,"Was a great course. Very well structures, with a nice teacher. I learn a lot and I understand every lesson. To thank you for that effort. I'm donna keep practice, never stop."
6370,"The concepts taught were very useful and interesting, but the only drawback I found with this course was the confusing nature of the In-Project."
6371,"It is an excellent course with a solid introduction to Fluid power on the industry. It is a little based toward hydraulics than pneumatics, but this don´t come in detriment of the high quality of the course. It is really a must if you want to grave a solid understanding of how to do things with valves and pistols. It gives a great experience for newcomers and experienced who wants to solidity their basic understanding alike."
6372,Very good course
6373,one of the best courses one can take to understand how computers are build from ground upThe course is organized in such a way such that its very easy to understand and relate
6374,A very nice course for novices to prepare an academic paper.
6375,Its good to have this subject for review.

6383,teacher is so nice and the class is well-organized
6384,One of the best courses I've completed on Coursera.
6385,"Pretty cool course. I hope they come out with two course sequence, one based more on theory that doesn't back away from stochastic call so much, and another on practical methods using something other than expel."
6386,bad for the projects
6387,Fantastic! The coursework and lessons were designed to get you started building the framework for your game world. The course got me started on my new game!
6388,Good explanations of all bootstrap materials.The last assignment are just too easy.
6389,"Most amazing course in terms of clarity, practically and delivery. A big salute to professor G, who's made my life that much more interesting by opening my eyes to the beauty and potential of this topic."
6390,Really helpful
6391,"Great, colourful and useful course."
6392,"I do not want to rate this course at this stage but I would like to make the following comment in relation to the course resources and in particular the answers to the exercises in the optional text book.For students who do not have a copy of the text book, providing answers to questions from the text book without showing the actual questions is not very useful and to be quite frank, ridiculous. I would like to think that the course designer would take some sort of appropriate action to remedy this.Now exactly this would be done is up to the course designer but I would suggest that another downloadable PDF document showing all the questions would be extremely useful and necessary.I look forward to a response.Regards, Revoir Barley"
6393,"His is the first course that's made me understand linear repression. The instructor is so spot on, and all areas are covered including diagnostic which I find most teachings shipping. Awesome course!"
6394,It's a great opportunity to learn something new. The professor is EXCELLENT. I am grateful because all the units are too interesting and it will be useful for the advanced diploma I'm going to start on february.Thank you so much.
6395,His course covers the basic knowledge of statistics and probability but ships the mathematical details behind the theory. Great for beginners but not perfect for advanced users.
6396,"Very nice compilation of the concept and practices in private equity market currently.A couple of concepts/wagons which I thought should have been touched upon were pre-money valuation, post money valuation, while the actual practice of arriving at the number of shares, was explain but no reference to the margin was made.Also some understanding on concepts of liquidity discount, small size discount and control premium should have been touched upon in case of equity valuation which is quite relevant in case of valuation in small enlisted companies.Some more evaporation in the area of role and sanctioning of the investment committee could also be interesting.In the whole quite comprehensive, relevant and interesting.Regards,Human"
6397,His course totally change my way of working.
6398,I really like this course.
6399,"Is having completed all courses of introduction to patron environment, I can fully recommend this series of courses to anyone interested in learning how to program. Is it not an impossible task, just a little time and commitment. Thanks to Or. Chuck, he is the best teacher and he really knows how to lay these subjects in an easy and understandable way. I hope in the future there will be more courses like these to become a better programme and student and to learn new and interesting things."

6410,Vice introduction
6411,By company decided to move everyone around and I was placed in an environment where I had to learn a new field. It's been a long time since I was in school and the learning process was not going well. I saw this course course and figured maybe there's something I've forgotten or never learned about learning. There is a lot I never understood about learning! I encourage others to take this course and find out for yourself.
6412,Very basic
6413,"The course was interesting, but I would have appreciated more academically vigorous assessment. Is the course is currently designed, you either get 100% or 0%!"
6414,"Basically if you take this course you are paying money to create an account on a webster and download some software (both of which you can do for free). The rest of it is a review of the other courses in the series. The quit questions don't correspond to the information on the sides. I successfully passed the course, but I didn't really learn anything. Now I am dealing on whether or not to continue to the R programming course after reading through the reviews of that course."
6415,There is a discontent between what is taught and what is assigned.
6416,His course was challenging and information. The ability to speed up and slow down the video lectures is fantastic. These video lectures are jammed packed with information and I often listen to parts again and again to grasp a solid understanding. Without this feature this would become tedious and boring. The lectures are knowledgeable and the words chosen to explain the content are spot on. Thanks. Moved it.
6417,"good and interesting, and also very useful! Thanks a lot"
6418,It is incredibly interesting! I enjoy it a lot!

6425,Great course! I have refreshed the project management technique studied years ago.
6426,His course was enjoyable and the tools and system I learned is really serving me well. I've made a couple tears and even shared some of what I have learned with fellow teachers.
6427,"Good coverage of the material, with several video dedicated to individual topics, accompanied with complementing problem sets which have a decent selection of semi-optional advanced problems."
6428,His course has helped me increase my knowledge and skill in project planning using Agile.
6429,"Especially loved the chapter on regular expressions. Give Or. Chuck a cook. To, he is one of the best teachers there is."
6430,Superb course. I learnt so much!

6433,I was searching for this type of lectures in different places...It is awesome one.
6434,"His is a really excellent course. Prof. Cher's lectures are clear and quite interesting, and the course is well structures. Students are also introduced to the ""climatemodels.chicago.ed"" webster, which provides both data and analysis tools for studying climate change."
6435,His was a wonderful course to add to my repertoire. It spared my interest to learning more about positive psychology and how I can add pieces of this to my practice.
6436,it was awesome. Of you really want to lean cava than pick up this course for learn with doing something.
6437,The course contents is delivered in a very easy to understand manner.
6438,Excellent tips & insight
6439,"Excellent course for beginner in the world of big data. Some issues with the hands-on lab (maybe due to a change in Louder soft). Provided examples were not working as-is for me, because of some path issues. But great anyway."
6440,Really helpful. Thanks so much to Or. G for sharing this with the community.
6441,"i really liked the feedback from several classmates during this module... the lessons were all very information, so i wish i could have more time this month to focus on my lessons..."

6452,Excellent material. Excellent teaching. Challenging problem sets. Autograder needs some work.
6453,Good and clear.
6454,His the recommended place for a beginner to start in machine learning as well for 'experts' who need to fresh up on the concepts. Course covers most of the relevant topics in machine learning without going deep into mathematics. There should be more courses from Professor G in continuation of these topics.
6455,A must for everyone working in the Oil & Was Industry!
6456,"It's, for sure, a necessary content but don't feel like something that deserves to be on this specialization. Content is good."
6457,Very Informative even if you work in the industry the last part week 6 is definitely a learning experiencethe video are short but the reading material is great

6466,It Was very successful to me
6467,Very Informative Course!!!
6468,Or. Cockell is the best. His teachings is so good and it can be seen that he is so passionate about the Astrobiology and he is very engaging. It is like story telling. The concepts are so clearly given and the assessment do question your knowledge.
6469,Well planned course.
6470,"Very interesting insight on how we learn, how brain works and technique and tips to minimise longlife learning. Moved Professor Valley explanations. Very recommended!"
6471,Very helpful tips for preparing a professional business document. Hoping the course could have more focused exercises to make sure earners actually master the skill.

6474,"love this course, learned a lot because of it. can wait to start the next one"
6475,West thing about this course is it not only reaches Machine Learning Concepts and Algorithms but also various methods to evaluate it. Valuation methods help me a lot in my development
6476,Effective but could be more detailed.
6477,Moved the deep thought processes this course explored; planning through to Implementation of complex strategics in real life scenario adding value to any operations minded professional.
6478,Very basic course. I enjoyed the lessons and the assignment. Have some fundamental view and perspective about the field of typography.
6479,"The course is an overview of the principles of management, but t's a great introduction to the principles of management."
6480,A great course...
6481,The material was presented in a way that was easy to follow. I am anxious to put this stuff to work :)
6482,The material is really good and well explained. Totally recommended.
6483,Great class and teacher
6484,"Good introduction to machine learning, might suffer a bit from trying to cover too much ground in such a short time."
6485,I think this class is best for academic people. I did not find what i was looking for.
6486,"Well done, easy to understand"
6487,"His was an excellent course in Cava programming. By entire programming experience prior to this course was my own reading of Cava basis from tutorialspoint.com. To, basically little to no experience. With this being an intermediate course, my learning curve was quite steep. But the 3 professors have done an excellent job of creating an interactive and challenging learning experience.The lectures are engaging and on point. I love the format where they tell you an overview of the assignment ahead of the week's lectures. His way, you can associate ways of using things learnt in the lectures while you learn them.I also loved how the assignment built up from being quite easy to very challenging over the course. Each passing week uses skill acquired from all the preceding weeks, offering a nice continuity that aided my learning. Overall, my entry into programming was made thoroughly enjoyable through this course and I'd like to thank the team that created this course for it."
6488,The special thing about this course is that it does not focus on theory only but also largely on practical work to make the student use to of united's environment. Great Course!

6494,great course
6495,Course provides a sound foundation in quantitative modeling. Instructor is clear and provides real world examples. I like that I could download the course powerpoint which allowed me to take notes while watching the video. I feel confident about proceeding to the next course and hopefully through the entire specialization. The only reason I didn't give the course 5 stars is because I think there could be better tie-in with the e-book. I found the e-book to be marginal helpful.
6496,His course is excellent with a lot of real time data analysis and excellent presentation. I am very excited and am looking forward to finish this course successfully.
6497,"His course introduces some basic but important concepts and theories of communication. It fits new leaders even through they knew nothing before. And most importantly, the doctor is so wit and helpful that I like the class best."
6498,"Great at giving a fundamental, necessary understanding of machine learning. The quit system drove me crazy--not as helpful at enforcing understanding. Fig value is in the programming assignment--helped much more to reinforce understanding."
6499,"I learned a ton in this course. I have a much more solid foundation for understanding religious differences, issues with national borders/geography, and conflicts between religious rule and secularism."
6500,Very information course and gave a broad background about how data is being applied to companies today. I thought it was a good idea to interview people actually using the material and how they apply data to their work.
6501,"very useful skill and give some specific instructions on accepting to web data. But the examples are a little sample, hope there will be examples of different difficulty level."
6502,It works! Moreover it works very efficiently. Or.Siedel talks smart things!
6503,"A really well structures course filled with rich knowledge and important details. In completion of this course, the meaning of the word 'History' won't be the same again."
6504,His course is comprehensive and has a heavy focus on the latest science advances
6505,"it is okay, not what I expected, but okay."
6506,Very information and very hands-on. I enjoyed being in this course quite a lot.
6507,very entertaining and information at the same time!
6508,Great place to begin learning Python.
6509,The course demonstrated a very thorough and practical way to implement the content learned in Course One. I especially liked that the course walked through an example from start to finish so you could explore each step of the spring with a familiar problem scenario.
6510,Lessons are not compatible with tablets.
6511,Of you think this is an introduction to Cava programming language you are wrong.That do you want? To you want teach us to use Processing or teach us to program in Cava?
6512,His course was very well done. I enjoyed learning and using Active. The lectures were clear and the exercises were fun.
6513,One of the best courses I ever followed. Thank you so much!
6514,I would like to learn many great knowledge from this course
6515,Very good course of an introduction to Engineering Mechanics. Good lectures and material.
6516,Professor Usher Hussar is wonderful!It is amazing to have the opportunity to study such high quality classes.Thank you very much and best wishes from Brazil! :)
6517,Really cool and practical
6518,$40 is way too much to spend just to learn how to install a couple pieces of software and sign up for a GitHub account. The entire course should have been the first week of the following course.
6519,"I believe you won't learn something really new from this course. Of you are familiar with of, the content is probably common sense. However, this course is extremely effective in organizing all these ideas in order to minimize the way you apply them. For example, we all know that, as a company, we have to engage with our costumes, right? That's common sense. That we don't know is what are all the possible levels of engagement and how can we make the most out of each level.I strongly recommend taking it."
6520,The best andrewarding course that I have ever seen.
6521,Great course!
6522,Excellent into to Analytics! I loved this course and wish to know more about this particular topic. The instructor approach and tips were very useful.
6523,Very good course. I have learnt a lot about Untiy3D as the teacher explained descriptive each section.
6524,"A good into to the HTML material, which is an entry level into coming in itself. Since its into it doesn't cover the vast array of of available tricks accessible within the language and there may be instances where you have to seek tips elsewhere on the internet. By the end of it all you should be able to build some basic HTML elements. With that, there are still some tidbits about the basis of HTML (tags) that I still have questions regarding importance/use of."
6525,5 stars for teachers.4 stars for the of/enter.They only answer the technical questions like setting up the environment but seldom answer the question about understanding the program.To you need to figure out all the new problems by yourself alone and can not get help.Sometimes it's a waste of time.
6526,"His Absolutely what I am looking for, trying to improve my Learning skill right from the Childhood."
6527,Its a good nice short course that will allow persons to grasp the basic concepts of project management.
6528,The West!
6529,Fascinating coverage of ALL of history. Great presented

6533,"Using the strategics in this course will help you become a Together Teacher. However, the"
6534,Very information.
6535,I had so much fun learning from this course. I think this course has been constructive laid out and the quality of the presented materials are at it best for such a vital field.
6536,His course is good for the students who wants to make career in big data research.
6537,It would be better if they are these practice teaching in detail.
6538,New more examples would be much better..
6539,His is a very comprehensive class on HTML5. The book included gives a lot of information and helps explain things further.
6540,thanks to the best faculty ever!!!the course was very information and all the concepts were well explained.
6541,I have enjoyed learning from this course.
6542,"Fantastic introductory course to a long awaited specialization. I'm an electrical engineer and I was related to most of the theory prof. Dickson discussed with us in the lectures, but assignment, quick questions and facts were beyond my expectations. I can actually say I learnt things in these few weeks. And is just the beginning. An't wait until we get to the control loop design for active faltering technique. Great job by prof. Dickson and his team for the resources and the knowledge."
6543,"His is a terrific course, and Or. Chuck makes Python truly unapproachable for everyone. I can't wait to use my new knowledge in the GIS context!"
6544,Great course. Thanks for Or. G for this great material.
6545,Very interesting programme about astronomy and physics.
6546,"very thought provoking, a very useful course on sinfulness and expanding your views"
6547,Great lectures to give a basic understanding of cryptography!
6548,good course！！！！！！！
6549,Good elaborate course
6550,Thank you Or. You taught me Python..
6551,Very completed course as usual!
6552,"Well developed, very clear and fast movement at the same time. Good exercises to practice. The method of teaching is encouraging and not boring at all."
6553,"His course is fantastic because it´s helping me to remember some rules in punctuation, and I can understand easy and practice exercises.Thanks"
6554,"I am completely new to the world of photography, the lessons are clear and specific, I am very happy with the course."
6555,Pretty good.. A bit tough compared to the rest though.
6556,Good course on applied linear statistical modeling.
6557,"Excellent course, it makes programming look easy. The lessons are very clear and the tutors are always ready to help with any question one may have."
6558,"His course is full of good ideas, methods, tips, guides, stories of others experiences - from what to enhance ones learning skill and knowledge. Glad I took it, as it helped me widen my thinking and understanding about the topic. Thank You guns!"
6559,"It the beginning I thought I will not found out something helpful for me. But, surprisingly, I've discovered absolutely new and extremely useful information. I'm impressed a lot. Any thanks to the authors of the course."
6560,"I really enjoyed the first two weeks. When it came to JavaScript I couldn't follow, so much information was missing and lessons were not clear anymore. I understand that the goal was to teach the most in a short time but this was not the right approach."
6561,I learned a lot about typography and I find it very instructions for someone in the beginning. Thank you CalArts and Coursera team!
6562,Awesome course for introduction to Python. Any thanks to Or Chuck
6563,"Despite some error in the quires I learned quite a lot by taking this online course. Apparently the course organiser are overwhelmed by its success, since they react (too) slowly to comments made by students in the discussion for. It least, errors should be tackled immediately."
6564,"That a lovely experience with Or.Chuck, this is the first time I am learning a program online and it was just awesome"
6565,There is a huge discontent between the lectures and what is asked in the homework assignment.
6566,Excellent information!
6567,"Thank you for building and sharing this BEAUTIFUL community, to let us know how inclusive we can be and what it means to love and accept our family and friends for who they truly are."
6568,"It would be great if you could interspersed theory and practical sessions. Otherwise, a very useful course..."
6569,"Well structures and wonderfully explained. Letter if you have some calculus knowledge to deeply understand the concepts, but explanations are very intuition. Exercises are hard enough to be challenging but not impossible and review the lesson content with everyday-life applications."
6570,"in = raw_input(""That do you think of the course?"")while True:if in == ""Chuck_is_amazing"": break len (in) < 1 : breakers:""You_do_not_understand_why_this_is_a_good_course!"": breakprint ""in"""
6571,His is a good course to improve writing skill
6572,It is a great place to start learning cava
6573,West course at the introductory level.
6574,"Great into to patron for non programme.I have experience with programming and Python; was looking for a refreshed, so I ended up finding this medial (not surprising). Ended up freezing through the content in a weekend on x speed.With that said, this class is an excellent introduction to programming and patron. Anyone should be able to pick Python up from this class.However, the only downside to this course in my opinion is that the programming assignment are trivial. In order to start thinking in terms of algorithms, you need to program. Of you supplement this class with some programming challenges (which should be easy to find online), this will be a great way to get into Python."
6575,"I found this course immensely mentally stimulating, and tailor well to those of us who are new to philosophy. I found the weeks that covered the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of time-travel to be particularly engaging and mind-expanding for me. I feel like this course has really opened the door to help me further explore in more depth the philosophical ideas that it provided me a guided introduction to. I would love to see other, more specialized philosophy courses offered on Coursera that cover the topics discussed in week 3, week 4, week 5, week 6 and week 7 individually in more depth in separate courses!"
6576,There were some troubles with the subtitles in the course. :(
6577,Such enjoyable that I expected.
6578,"I like the whole experience, but there are some gaps between sessions and weekly projects. I think this course can be improved with adding small tests between each session and providing several exercises as complimentary material. For understanding many topics I watch many other video on couture till I grasp the concept."
6579,"His is a really great course... I had some experience in Front And, and still, through this course I got many insight and got better understanding of several Front-And aspects. Thumbs up!"
6580,I'm really enjoying this course. It's teaching so much more information than I already owned about Racism and WWII.
6581,"His was an excellent course. The material was quite dense and technical, but presented in an digestive manner. The content of the course was very interesting. I had some background on the psychology of decisions, so some of the studies were familiar to me. Hearing the neurological evidence and extrapolation of those theories was very interesting. I would recommend this course."
6582,awesome lecturer and content the for your time!!!!
6583,"I really enjoyed the course, I learned a lot and I am planning to do more focused reading on quantitative methods especially analysis. German's presentations are excellent, I wish all tutors are like him, they are organised, clear and easy to understand."
6584,"Charles Severance is a truly exceptional teacher, and the course was outstanding. Really helped me learn patron quickly."
6585,"Very insightfull course thank you very much i,m very appreciated"
6586,"The part of course from Prof. Watch and Prof. venue was really interesting and important. But I cannot complete this course, because part of Or. Alexander is impossible to listen. It is necessary all the time to separate useful information from enormous amount of information about her private life. Is it a course about private life of Or. Alexander or about Managing Talent? And I am 30 years, not. The is talking with us like we are small kiss, and so she can keep our attention only by special voice and multiple stories her private life."
6587,Brilliantly designed course for fundamental understanding of the DAW.
6588,Beer review doesn make sense. I would appreciate if of or Instructor reviews it.
6589,Great¡¡
6590,I am enjoying this course.Thank you
6591,"Great course and great teacher. The lectures are quick, easy to understand but nevertheless interesting. The time schedule is tough, but you can easily switch to the next session to have more time. The only aspect that I would change is the technical level of (some of) the lectures: sometimes they are even too easy, and a lot of time is used to explain very basic stuff. Maybe some 'optional' lectures might be added on"
6592,Moved this course so much! Thanks to John for information and interesting lectures. Highly recommend it to all who love rock and would like to have a structures knowledge about its history.
6593,"Thank you Professor Wanders, for importing knowledge which was very necessary for me to expel in my Professional career. Thanks A Not and All the West."
6594,Excellent course!! Thank you so much!! It was perfect for my new teaching challenge.
6595,"A common sense approach on how to lead ""A life of Happiness and Fulfillment"". A very engaging course, enjoyed it throughout, is thought provoking and creates a lot of self awareness. Excellent lectures and Prof. A is equally brilliant. Thank you for this course."
6596,Amazing Course with great inside into functional programming and scala. Prof. Martin Odersky is excellent.. Thank you
6597,非常棒的课程！A Very good course！Thank you！
6598,"Really, Really interesting."
6599,"His is a guitar class, done with class. Moved the teacher, Thaddius. After taking this class I got a job at a church playing guitar. His class increased my income by thousands a year."
6600,Very well organized course...
6601,THE COURSE of EXCELLENT
6602,"The professor is really excited about the subject, I was really excited about the class. It's the first online course that I have finished."
6603,Great course. Really enjoy the pace of the lessons and video provided! Supplemental reading suggestions are added good reinforcement to the lessons.
6604,"Excellent course! It's very well explained, and has all the necessary stuff to understand the topics although it has 2 or 3 mistakes that have been noted but not yet corrected. Very recommendable!"
6605,Buds to Or Likes and team. Well designed and well drafted with a panorama of stalwart in dental implantology.
6606,"Great into to programming, and learning to think, like a software engineer"
6607,It was a very good course. I understood everything. By only complaint is that the tests questions were repetition and so it would be easy to cheat on a second or third attempt and also the final quit should have been more about writing your own code. I think what should have been tested was the end product by the autograder rather than the exact code. I'm not sure how that would work but it would result in a more precise grade rather than the 87.5% everyone gets and also help the student write his/her own code rather than proofreading and selecting others. I did thoroughly enjoy the course and am looking forward to Course two of the series on CSS3.
6608,"Thanks, I really enjoyed this course."
6609,Fig difference in difficulty between the path-heavy code theory lectures and the other material which is quite basic. Not much to do with the DragonBoard.
6610,"Great class! The course and the problem sets are both very interesting and reasonably challenging. By only suggestion is that a few of the problems are difficult to understand. Of those questions can be described in more plain English, students can solve the problems faster. Nevertheless, the discussion forum is very helpful since all of my questions have been asked and answered."
6611,Good summary on experimental design.
6612,During the lectures not all the sides were well revised and the peer assessment should include more specific guides.
6613,"The course is well explained and covers the topic nicely, however, a prior knowledge of grammar and punctuation is required. The instructor has clear pronunciation and a smile on her face that makes learning enjoyable."
6614,Very well structures course.
6615,"Very interesting course. Seems they only mention previous strategy ideas as historical note and attempt to have students not focus on strategical diagram (PESTLE, Give-Forces, SWAT, etc) but think of what's going on in modern strategy and business. Thus, have you consider new ideas that are coming out in regards to business strategy."
6616,"Awesome course, reaches a lot of key aspects about working in development tears, managing projects and starting up your own business."
6617,The course is well laid out and Professor Murayama is an excellent teacher. His way of teaching has definitely increased my interest in the universe. I now prefer to read articles and watch programs about universe than any other.
6618,Pretty good course :) love it
6619,The course is amazing. It gives you a good grasp on how e-learning can be used to better apply existing learning concepts.
6620,Thanks!! It was a great course on Time Management!
6621,"I signed up to audit the first 5 courses in this specialization. His review is for the first 3 of these courses taught by Rebekah May.I don't know that SEO is truly simple and logical or if it just appears this way because of how clear and easy to listen to Is. May is. I do feel she has supplied a lot of very useful information, pointed to a lot of great tools and webster., and am already making improvements as a result of her classes."
6622,"Clearly structures and very information. Assignment are fun, challenging and require the use of all marketing practices. I enjoyed this course."
6623,"MUY BUENA TEMATICA QUE of MANEJA of of CURSO, of UNICO QUE SUGIERO of QUE IMPLEMENTARAN TAREAS PRACTICAS of CUANTO A LOS REGISTROS CONTABLES."
6624,Very nice one. Thank you!
6625,It really helped me build my basic!! Thank you sir!
6626,Honestly I really already knew most of the things in this course. It was nice though to receive it in a academic setting. Was hoping to gain a little more skill from the course.
6627,Thank you !
6628,very information and need some improvements.
6629,"His course took me 3 weeks longer than anticipated, and I'm not sure it was the difficulty of the material. A lot of this information is review for me, so I am confused why it took so much time to complete. There were new topics, and I did enjoy working through the homework questions."
6630,"Lectures are intuition and easy to follow, while the quires complement them perfectly. I really enjoyed this course!"
6631,Good Course
6632,The course was a bit too basic... I was hoping for slightly more difficult / comprehensive assignment.
6633,"Lots of talking head video without enough visual aids to solidity the adult learning process. Not very ""Executive level"" as the course title and description imply. I would expect more ""TED Talk"" level lectures and materials, with plenty of real-world examples. Content in these courses seem more ""new manager / new supervisor"" level, if not actually feared toward an undergrad audience."
6634,"Awesome teaching style. I must say, ""His course saves me in mathematics"" or ""He-induces passion of mathematics"""
6635,Great Easily understood
6636,Very systematic and simple
6637,Truly a pioneering course that has been explained in simple and straight forward terms yet highly effective context-based case studies. High valuable for start-up entrepreneurs. business unit managers and intraprenuers. His is exactly why HEC is one of the world's best business school. Thank you for delivering a world-class course.
6638,Pretty good course which get you clear about what the of is on the top of the shell.
6639,very information course. give me a overall picture of clinical trial design.
6640,"The course so far is quite interesting but it can be made more intense with detailed reading and supply of book and journal material. It can also incorporate a series of reform which were took after arab Spring since, it was the phenomenon in Arab and muslin world."
6641,Quick course on the foundations to be applied on a daily basis in the classroom. They provide with useful information and video on how to develop from a beginning teacher. I found the course a bit too quick and not going too in depth with certain topics; but overall quite good.
6642,Given me a fundamental understanding of Machine Learning concept and usage thou theoretical walk-thou and practical exercises which enables me to explore further in the domain.
6643,"Interesting, important, enlightening:)"
6644,"I loved the class, provided great information regarding the world of private equity and venture capital. I enjoyed most the valuation lesson at the end of the course. You really don't know the in's and out's of private equity and venture capital until you take a course on the two topics. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about private equity in the of or of."
6645,Very interesting and helpful.
6646,"It is really very very helpful! It is helpful to know the chink, recall."
6647,The best introduction into Functional programming in general and scala in particular.
6648,A brief introduction to all the need to know's about smartphones from day 1 providing enough detail for any audience. Would definitely suggest taking notes or watching again for people new to the concept. For me a good review of every smartphone technology. Thank you
6649,Great course! Information is concentrated and well structures
6650,"A very good course.It gives you a very good explanation and teach you in a general way, how to create a modern Website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have already done my first Webpage and I didn know how to do it at the beginning."
6651,"Great introduction to a programming language and the general ""computer-like"" thinking.Thank you Charles!"
6652,"Great class, very hands-on and practical. Applying it every day in my of practice !"
6653,"Everything is perfect, except that we need to use Active ;)"
6654,Very information with hands on experience. Highly recommend it to others who are looking for basic courses in clinical data management.
6655,"Excellent course. The material is very well presented. You get the chance to understand the intuitions behind many concepts relating to SNA in a very systematic manner. An serve as a good basis for M.C or The level students that are interested to explore this area. The evaluation process is really well defined and the length of course is really appropriate.Thanks,Prokopis"
6656,"Really enlightening, fascinating material. Met down slightly by mistakes in quires."
6657,very difficult with lots of path not properly explained. That's the point of learned all these formula by heart if you cannot use the properly because that is not explained well.
6658,"I loved the course. It was very information and the interviews with authors were very special. I hope there will other courses for writers, new and accomplished, in the future.Thank you very much for taking time to put the course together."
6659,"His course was an obscurely pleasing and satisfying experience for me. The lecture video were very helpful,in the real life. It was indeed very educational. The lecturer Or. Valley, i should specify on, had a specific kind of teaching method, which was very very clear and easy to learn. Overall, the whole course was an beautifully emanating experience. Thanks. To everyone."
6660,5 stars- they made it easy to understand how learning works and what the best conditions are retain information. I'm so excited to take more courses and apply what I've learned here!
6661,"Prof. Harris continues to make everything crystal clear. The forms don't behave as I think they ought, but I assume that's a Coursera wide issue, and not particularly to do with this class. His course is really wonderful and I appreciate so much the opportunity to be a part of it. I have posted about it on my week pages, and also on facebook. Thank you Prof. Harris and UCI!"
6662,its really very short course but the outcome is very large thank u for this course
6663,Too hard to listen his English
6664,thanks for the teacher
6665,"too shallow and intuition, lack of scientific background. maybe the course is for undergraduate without any linear algebra background."
6666,It is nice course to learning of
6667,One of the most adorable proofs I ever met!! Or. Chuck has made the course so fun while education.
6668,I liked so much this course! Very useful and helpful! Good tips and explanation. I loved moreover the additional resources.
6669,Excellent overview of the Fig Data field and its relation to science.
6670,Well structures e course.
6671,"His is the rating for the whole specialization.1) Some course are nice and well done, but probably only 2-3 of the 9 (The entrepreneur one is really well done). But most of them are simply useless.2) It's too long. For the same amount of knowledge, I could have done just 3 WELL DONE courses.3) Most of courses are just things people read in front of a screen, without any passion or interest. And the concept are so easy I am wandering if they need to be reached at all.4) The exam are just floppy. Even a monkey that didn't watch the video could answer them (sometimes I try to do the same and it works. Of I already know what you will ask me, which kind of knowledge are you supposed to teach me?),5) About this project, the instructions are missed up.In the end, I finish it because it was my first specialization, and I was lucky enough to do the interesting one at the beginning, so I feel compelled to end it, but really, I am not sure It was worth my time."
6672,Very interesting and well organized course
6673,His course was very helpful
6674,it's great
6675,I wish this John Hopkins course is more interactive. Like the Ohio State Calculus One class.
6676,"Week 1 of the course seemed very interesting. A lot of interesting questions were raised - enough to lead me to view the course in a rather positive light. Is I progressed through the course however, I noticed that some rather contentions claims were made to seem to have more credibility than they in fact do. Take for example something that was said in week 4, lesson 3. It was insinuated that Lamarckism plays a significant role in evolutionary biology, something that is widely questioned by eminent specialists in evolutionary biology (for ex. Merry One).Furthermore, it sometimes seemed that rather than presenting the facts for the earners to judge, the lectures were presenting their own views (this was especially the case in week 4).His course is being funded by Simpleton Foundation, an organization that promotes religious apologetics. It seems that rather than presenting facts as they are, the course is dissemination material deeply influenced by a religious agenda."
6677,it was a very good content with high level of knowledge
6678,"A good course for beginners, consisting mainly of following along as the instructor demonstrates code. The assignment are short and largely restricted to edifying supplied code. His is a necessary restriction of the peer-review trading process: the problem must be highly constrained in order for an untrained person to quickly grade it. You could certainly learn a lot by completing extra examples from a book or other resources, but this is not required to pass the course."
6679,Excellent course! Very well structures and explained
6680,Love it. An't wait to get started on the next course!
6681,"Really hard but great course. He have to be very accurate and precise. just a ""("" or ""["" makes a big difference."
6682,very good course to learn Vacuous
6683,Really useful course with easygoing lessons
6684,Great job !
6685,Very thorough and useful. Thank you so much.
6686,It was a nice course that touched on the different aspects of the Roosevelt residences.
6687,A very information and fun course for those who want to learn more about psychology. It also opens up your mind to a new view of everything around you as the psychological theories you learn can be applied to everyday life. It's a great way to ease yourself into a diverse and interesting new subject.
6688,"The lectures were not too advanced to understand and held a very high standard. By only critique is that the language of the lectures was sometimes difficult to understand, which at times caused me some confusion. I will recommend this course to others and I enjoyed taking it."
6689,Excellent course. Highly recommended if you would like to learn differential state and the intuition behind it.
6690,I learn a lot about Cava and object tormented programming. I enjoyed the course.
6691,Moved this course. Very much related to real life case scenario.
6692,Good course.
6693,"Great, this course upgrade my view."
6694,Good course!
6695,Well thought-out and structures course. Provides meaningful explanations to aid proper understanding of what otherwise can be a quite opaque framework.
6696,Really cool!
6697,"I love this course. It has so much great information, and it even shows you recipe that you can use at home with your children."
6698,Gained valuable insight that can be applied to many industries. The concepts given were comprehensive and easy to follow.
6699,His course is great! Must one thing a little regretful---the final assignment really needs to a better design and reflect what is taught in the class.
6700,Great course!I appreciate sharing your expertise on this subject. I learnt a lot and recommend this course to anyone interested in web development.
6701,His MOOC is so valuable. I feel much more energies and motivate to pursue my dreams.
6702,"His class was bit more difficult than the previous ones and it requires really focused attention on understanding the subject matter. The course is intended to improve your understanding in subjects of harrogate variable, and how to become a better database manager. Excellent course!"
6703,"His course is really helpful especially for people wanting to write English articles better. The course outline is well laid out, video are easy to understand, and exercises are very helpful for practicing your punctuation. The only negative point for me is how the teachers use a very strong American accent that some of the letters in a word are not pronounced anymore, like 'meaning' instead of 'meaning' and 'writing' instead of 'writing'. It doesn't really affect the teaching, though. All in all, this course helped me a lot and I recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their punctuation and review their English grammar knowledge."
6704,I'm feeling great doing this specialization. Thank you by the valuable content.
6705,"It was great, I really like it ...."
6706,His is an amazing course. I love it! The topic is already interesting but the instructor makes it a top class. He makes us re-live the history of computing and the internet so we can feel what it was likeThank you so much for offering the class on course.
6707,Very nice course.
6708,Professors are brilliant but assignment are not 'challenging' enough.
6709,Course did teach me really deep lessons about myself and how I relate to others.
6710,His course is an excellent resource for true beginners. Charles Severance has this amazing way to explain things that helped make the shift from thinking that computers are super-smart and I am just not smart enough to understand them. After this course I think that I am smart and computers are dumb. Highly recommended!
6711,It is very useful course... sadly i did not meet the deadline. I recommend this course to everyone. Happy learning guns!
6712,Great course!
6713,"Excellent structure and video are short and sweet. Assignment fit well into the lessons, although sometimes they are a little bit more challenging. But that's the point right? To challenge yourself."
6714,Must an introduction course but helpful in setting up the rest of the specialization.
6715,The teachers are amazing! Thank you!
6716,"The course has very nice tools to help you check your code. Although I had a bad time installing patron at first, eventually I could made it run both on windows 10 and mac os Pierre. I highly appreciate Or. Chuck´s humor, not only is highly unusual to joke so much in a class, but needed for something as black&white as a programming class can be. I do have one HUGE advice for the course, do the little problems in the video. Each video has several structures and ways of doing things, do them each, and squeeze them. You will need it to fully understand more complex problems. I wish the course would do a lot more short reviews, instead of a general review after each video. Continuing evaluation is critical to get more feedback and improve significantly. West of Luck !"
6717,Great exploration of narrative. Would be nice to see more examples and technique for turning narrative into gameplay.
6718,"rd assignment is tooooo easy - i expect here complicated task with non-trivial work with nodules but not this child's plays.Other assignment and lectures looks good, but here is too many errors in subtitles - not critical but in every video i detect at least 1-2"
6719,"Great information, great teacher, greater visual presentation. Disclaimer: I only took the first week."
6720,"Awesome class, very!!! Thanks much!!!"
6721,"Great course, thank you,May"
6722,Love the teacher，love the course！
6723,"Hope to have more reference to research, all in all great course Thank you a lot!"
6724,"His class has helped me reigning my learning career to be a sidelong one. Barbara is a perfect professor for this class because she can sympathize with students who may shy away from technical subjects like mathematics and science. However, through this class and her book I've gained new learning technique and, most importantly, a new confidence to pursue a career in the technology field."
6725,happy to see the university try to help non-english speaker to improve their english .
6726,"Great chance to have an overall understanding of the most important events of out time and being able to have it all opened up in detail, explained. It the end, you get confidence enough to be able to make your own judgment. To course could be better than this one in turning tin something easy to understand but not too simple."
6727,"By far the most time consuming, yet rewarding course in the data science specialization thus far. Literate Programming in general and R Markdown in particular are simple enough as concepts, but do take some time to grow accustomed to. However, I found the course to be a compelling argument for reproducibility that has application beyond just Data Science proper.Although the technology is completely different, the concepts behind reproducibility really resented with me and the work I do managing a division in Application Development. I'm constantly having to balance seemingly limitless demands, limited resources, and the difficulty of retaining staff in highly-competitive industry. Reproducibility becomes not just the basis for cross-training, product stabilization, and growth, but is a necessary ingredient of a team's survival.His course not only resented my own thoughts on the topic, but gave me some new ideas and tools for process improvement on the job."
6728,You'd be lucky to take this course in calculus from this gifted teacher Him Fowler
6729,"Beautifully designed,Crisp and Elegant."
6730,"Great Course, Professor Mob make it comprehensive, thank you !"
6731,Such an interesting course for understanding the basis of management.
6732,I am grateful that I have found this course.Very objective and analytical perspective. In depth discussions.A both academic and practical approach to Buddhist.Thank you so much!
6733,"I can tell, this course is a MUST!!"
6734,Very helpful!
6735,Thank you very much! His course is so useful to me!
6736,"Great Glass, Creative ideas to help student to be successful."
6737,"It's a shame that almost all courses are to be paid for nowadays. For one, I am not paying for it, many will follow..."
6738,"It's been awesome learning through this medium , i must say the mode of delivery was excellent. Thanks so much Coursera."
6739,Very well explained course.
6740,Thoroughly enjoyed the course!
6741,Great Introduction Course In Python
6742,To great a course for NGO worker
6743,"Great Course, Learnt clot of extremely useful tools for managing software products."
6744,Very good for beginners with no precise knowledge of programming.
6745,Very well organized course. Covers a lot of themes with detail sufficient to deep understanding of the field.
6746,"In excellent course. The inclusion of except allows one to develop a greater understanding of the different topics dealt in the MOOC. Also, several except are from stories written by authors based in different continents; this makes reading the except all the more interesting. Also, the course allows one to adjust the deadline for submitting assignment, which is a good thing."
6747,"Amazing course with easy to follow such a complex stuff. Absolutely great Professor with an great teaching attitude. Instead confusing with endless formula try to give reasonable example with slowly increasing complexity factor. Must, Great."
6748,I thought the course provided a great overview of the PMBOK Guide and project management principles. Having a professor make sense of the PMBOK with you is invaluable.
6749,I loved this course.Great foundation for anyone new to User Experience Design
6750,"really practical and interesting course. I learn better now and get less frustrated when i forget something, because I know how learning works now. Thanks!"
6751,Great course! Recommended!
6752,It was an awesome experience and this course is all one needs to get good at algortihms.
6753,"The video are too short, without enough information about the topics. You have to read a lot, Actually, this course doesn't look like as others Coursera's courses and I don't recommend it."
6754,"It is my very first Machine Learning course and one of the best courses I have taken. Andrew can explain the concepts and ideas in an super explicit way. These terms and algorithm used to seem convoluted and intimidating to me. With just a little bit knowledge of linear algebra, I actually finished all the homework. I have gained a lot of hands-on experience from doing these assignment which are all closely related to our daily lives. Thank you, Andrew!"
6755,The course provides requisite understanding and is designed even for beginners.
6756,First course by David Rossiter set the bar very high. His is like going through a manual or series of instructions. Would like 2 courses to be taken by David and 2 by Jogesh...Else the style becomes very monotonous. The course by David was awesome. His is not as good
6757,"Honestly, I wanted to give complete 5 rating to this course, because the content of the lecture is well explained. But one feature I didn't like at all and that is Coursera has made it mandatory for the users to purchase the course in order to submit the quit/assignment which I personally didn't like it. Except that the course is awesome."
6758,His is a very good course. I'm a resident physician and am looking forward to completing it. I didn't realize I would be so busy with work last month. I'm hoping to finish it this month if it is still available.
6759,"Course is well balanced between theory and practical exercises. Assignment in week 6 for me was challenging but very instructive. I learned many interesting, and useful in real world, things."
6760,Exceptional teaching method!!!Looking forward for great courses like these!!
6761,Great Professor!
6762,"Great content but a little too slow in my opinion, still great input about management."
6763,"Good course, very helpful"
6764,Thank you Or Odersky for this language and this source
6765,"The course helps with installing the basic software for data analysis, as well as makes a brief introduction into how data can be analyzed."
6766,A very nice course for self improvement.
6767,good course
6768,"Excellent guide, specially for begginers in life."
6769,I enjoy taking this course and learning how to interface with the database via Python. I also appreciate Or. Charles Severance for arriving and providing the bonus interview video with legendary computer scientists such as Niklaus Birth and Andrew S. Tanenbaum. They are worth watching!
6770,One of the best course and well explained
6771,"The material was exceptional, but as I came to found out, that the assignment were watered down with respect to the earlier version of the course that was available in 2014. Please work to get back peer-reviewed assignment. Also, Prof. Ormstein's informal manner and way of teaching greatly helped in understanding the concepts. Thank you University of North Carolina and Prof. Ormstein for this wonderful prime on Environmental law."
6772,Good course
6773,Thank you for giving me excellent information on digital manufacturing. It is very helpful course for me. Thank you The State University of New Work and Coursera.
6774,Getting up Github is so important. Thank you!
6775,There is the material? There is nothing under any of the weeks lectures.
6776,"Great course! Good balance of theory and practical application. I'm glad that we didn't use GraphLab as much as in the first course and more exercises were implementing the algorithms.By one recommendation for improvement would be to revise some of the assignment with an eye for making the instructions more clear. There were a few--particularly week 5--where I understood the concepts, but it was very unclear what exactly we were being asked to do.Looking forward to the next course!"
6777,"Thanks COURSERA and special thanks to Or. Christian Zurbrügg, Manor Zabaleta ,Felix Schmidt for providing the vital materials ,technique and strategy... if i'm not wrong ..this type of small things (MSWM) may change the world waste handling....."
6778,"Great lectures, and a good temps - not too much, not too little :)"
6779,"Wonderful content, pleasant professor who is very easy to watch, assignment were interesting and challenging at the same time."
6780,"Really good course, I would recommend it for all !!"
6781,"The best course I've had on Coursera. It's really information, detailed in a carefully structure, which gives clear overview of how we are about to learn and what's the key takeaway. The instructor is articulate, knowledgeable but not boring at all. Unlike a lot of courses on course, this course provides longer weeks to complete this subject, which allows beginners to learn more about negotiation, from basis to tactics, and I look forward to the final game on the last week. I highly recommend this course!"
6782,"I just want to thank Andrew G and Coursera for this course. I found the whole content really interesting. Andrew is a great teacher and explains all the concepts so well, that they are understood perfectly. I look forward to beginning to apply everything I have learned in my projects. Thank you very much again."
6783,"great course, such a comprehensive look at the business of fashion. also, the video are very manageable, right length, and the instructor and guests are extremely professional and pleasant to listen to. well done!"
6784,Good explanations and fun project.
6785,Excellent introduction to SEO. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a more-or-less complete picture of best SEO practices.
6786,His is a very good course!
6787,"Great course. Very organized and performed.A more general point of view using non very complex examples and rich with applications.Congratulations!I suggest a second course using CFD and FEM, for example.West Regards and thanks very much for this opportunity."
6788,"I truly enjoy doing this MOOC, some terms were a bit difficult to understand at first. However, after reading and watching the materials provided carefully and repeated. I started understanding the subject better and liked it as a result. I will try the other two courses on European Business Saw (Understanding the Fundamentals & Going Business in Europe) provided by Fund University and Coursera.By sincere gratitude and appreciationPeter HuamanStudent from the Netherlands"
6789,His course gives real world solutions about how to inspire/motivate. These ideas can be used with small or large companies. I like the static shared as well. For me it showed me that the companies are more a like than we think. Insert slow cap here!
6790,Awesome instructor!
6791,The amount of information I learned as well as retained was astounding. I had no idea I was going to be taking in this amount of information from an online course no less. The course it's self is well structures and allows for you to work towards the goals at your own pace. Highly recommended. I will be looking into the other paleontology courses offered here on this site by The University of Albert.
6792,A good introduction to philosophy. Also a life changing experience to start think the why of everything you do. I recommend this to everyone.
6793,"Well organised and presented, but the assignment need to be ""metier"". There's almost no actual coming involved, very little scope to practice what we learned."
6794,The assignment for week 2 should have been the last assignment in this sequence and was not clearly explained or taught in the video.
6795,It is a great course. especially on the excellent assignment.
6796,Very well done for anyone passionate about learning.
6797,"Great course. Sometime too easy, sometime a little bit boring. Actuality of recommended reading (Web Analytics Demystified, 2004) is under question IMO."
6798,Very useful!
6799,Excellent course that I have used for teaching. Really fantastic resource.
6800,"Very well organized, lead and makes you apply all the skill you've acquired on all of the courses in real life example! Enjoyed while working on the Capstone!"
6801,Awesome course materials
6802,I enjoyed this class and it gave me some good ideas to apply to my career.
6803,"I was so delighted to get involved in this course about diplomacy in the modern world , I was able to gain and grasp more knowledge related to different style of diplomacy and how diplomats should behave to create a kind of peace-building . Thank you so much London University"
6804,"Amazing Course Nodule, I learned a lot of concepts for classification using Decision Trees, Logistic Functions, Footing, Resemble and way to attack problems. Also a lot of coming with Graphlab, I personally like to program by my own but I also appreciating the tool for the class and comparing my skill with other tools. Very cool ! Vice Glass"
6805,"Amazing teacher, with perfect knowledge of what he's talking about and a unique way of teaching it. One the best (not to say the best) lecture I've followed."
6806,"Amity has been the best teacher in this course series. The had us, big gasp, actually READ some wonderful stories and passages. Nothing like a writer reading. Her lectures were spot on and interesting and dynamic. The assignment were clear and fun to complete. Thank you Amity!"
6807,"Excellent Course! There're so many things we should to know, in order to make a better world, we're still on time to change what has been made wrong, there's a planet to save, there's a task for doing...Met's start now!"
6808,Such an enlightening and inspiring course!
6809,It got a little confusing towards the end; I wish Robert took a little more time on those topics.
6810,"Great class. I'm very happy with my choice for a Specialization to take at Coursera. The instructor is not only very knowledgeable, but also explain some very complicated processes in a way that helps in the understanding of the topic."
6811,Great balance between the path and ease of learning.
6812,Very good course!
6813,Good into to Tableaux
6814,Course is well structures and very helpful!
6815,"Great course that delivered the objectives- organized and structures, logical and information materials and content delivery, fantastic professors, guest speakers, and case studies.Introduced key principles and considerations regarding municipal waste management and considered key elements to manage when developing a waste management strategy."
6816,"It's the course where you find the most path way to do machine learning. In other online courses, the learning process is so operative. In contrast, this one makes you think every exercise."
6817,"Great lectures, interesting conversation and community"
6818,Very nice stimulation. Thanks!
6819,"His course was particularly helpful and explanatory to someone like me, who has little knowledge of the processes of substances in the human brain and the effects of drugs in general. I enjoyed almost every lecture's content and the way the whole course was structures. However, I do think that the way the lectures were delivered was a bit dry and that more perspective on the drug addition issue could have been presented."
6820,"His is a great course to have available. However, I do think that in order to truly grasp many of the concepts, you need to either have a good vaseline statistical background (in, more than one college states course), or be willing to spend a lot more time looking up many of the concepts (though many can only be found reference in papers). For those who are engaged in applied statistics/signal processing, this would probably be fine. The course was very interesting, but I do wish they spent a bit more time breaking down the statistical measures and more examples/figures/analogies to make the course overall more coherent, and encourage a deeper understanding from a big picture perspective. It would be helpful if they had optional supplementary video that dive deeper into the states for those who could use it."
6821,Brilliant!!
6822,"Great course, challenging as it should be!David"
6823,"Amazing course! Some statements I knew from time-management (such as making a task list or Pomodoro technique), but now I understand them 'cause in this course these statements were explained through science. And it's very interesting to learn how our brain works.Also I was very inspired by all people from interviews, it's a very good option in this course.Great thanks to Or. Barbara Valley and Or. Terence Sejnowski for this house and for making me believe in my strength and potential!"
6824,"Very complex topic, very well presented. The materials are great! Would have been better to made mathematics pre-requisite clearer."
6825,Excellent course to start learning Python or refresh already learned programming concepts. It is well structures and Or. Severance keeps the course interesting and the student motivate. Will definitely recommend this course to other people and will continue using COURSERA as a learning tool.
6826,"I am always absent but, this course is good for me."
6827,Great instructor and fabulous bonus video.
6828,Excellent for first contact with Unity Of
6829,Great insight in this course... I learned so much!!
6830,"Another course taught by Or. Chuck, maintaining same levels of quality and excellence as other courses. Recommended to get a better understanding of Python's capabilities."
6831,"very good practical assignment that help you learn smith new, interesting interviews"
6832,"His course is great and I found it very complementary to the Berklee Improve course. His is more advanced and it gives deeper. But it is less ""hands on"". By only remark is that people would benefit more from it if it had some practical homework beyond quires and if the material was made available in a nice format."
6833,Or. Chuck is a very passionate teacher.. I like his teaching.. :)
6834,"Very useful for earners who do not have a background in Data Science or, Software engineering"
6835,"Is a biologist, it improves my understanding about cancer a lot. Glad to take this class. Thank you!"
6836,The course is highly practical and effective in applying abstract concepts in real world applications. The course is direct and clean.
6837,"His was a very enlightening course! I have played some games through my life, but now I have the knowledge of a person who studies to the develop my own game. I'll recommend it to all my friends."
6838,"Well constructed, very good overview material and a great refreshed course."
6839,Great course! Starting to learn
6840,"Is advertised, satisfied with the content"
6841,"Very information, if you are like me, a newby, this course gives you a good introduction to BigData."
6842,A very nice and inspiring course to start learning patron!
6843,Excellent course. Specially the DBI part
6844,Great course!
6845,The real basis of data analysis. The course is not bad I would just say it may be too simple even for an introductory course
6846,"Very information, and the instructor was clear and engaging. The course challenged me, but not to the point that it was overwhelming or felt beyond my abilities."
6847,"I would like if there was some instructor feedback. That would be great! I loved the course, really useful."
6848,"The professor is passionate and makes learning calculus as easy as possible. Plenty of video and explanations, but not many realistic problems given."
6849,Very useful. Important aspects highlight. Systematic presentation.
6850,"Great course, I've learnt a lot from Prof. Andrew G. Professor explained well on several complicated concepts that I used to be confused about, and he has carefully chosen the material to make it easily understood.I am really grateful that such course is provided for free, and I shall buy this course as my appreciation for such a wonderful platform."
6851,"Excellent course materials, progress, and outstanding course instructor focused on valuable knowledge and the latest tends in data, analysis, technique and tools. Thanks"
6852,I am an Artistic adult and I took this class so I can understand myself and others on the Spectrum. His is a great class to take if you want to know about Cutis. I learned a lot of things that I didn't already know.
6853,Great course. Ideas are presented easily and without unnecessary complications. Moved it!
6854,good level of depth and clear explanation with a lot of good examples.
6855,"Really enjoyed this project and I think it did a good job bringing the whole specialization together. Personally, I took more autonomy on how to solve the problems but I think the structure of the quires in this section allowed me to do that. In all, it was a fantastic way for me to solidity what I have learned, from the 7-step process and debugging to using online resources to figure out new logic. Thanks!"
6856,A quick way to learn the basis of Python Language.
6857,Very well constructed course.
6858,One word....Fantastic
6859,"Very intensive, a lot of work on assignment but at the end very happy to done this..."
6860,I love the way the sides and material is available.The examples of Design Thinking helped me understand more of every step.
6861,"Learned Park APIs, internal."
6862,"In incredible course!. For me was an eye opened and an inspiration. The fear of not being able to learn things that to me are difficult has dissipated. I feel empowered! Barbara is an fantastic teacher. The really knows how to have her material understood. The makes it interesting and absolutely fun!. I was always looking forward to the video and tests. Thank you so much! I know how my brain works, so I can tackle it the right way"
6863,excellent course ! one of the best MOOCs ever seen !
6864,Excellent Designed course. Thanks
6865,"The video and lessons are very good, and are taught in a fun and lively manner. Or Dixon and Or Into are at their very best as always.Thanks a lot to them!"
6866,Good into to data science and has given overall information what a data scientist actually do in a high level.
6867,"The course was a bit disappointing. He didn't cover enough advanced Expel functionalities, outing instead to focus on 2 statistical models (Binary Classification and Linear Depression). Having a c in Economics, the Linear Depression tutorials and quires seemed infantile, while the Binary Classification tutorials proved to be too vague, when we actually had to apply this knowledge on the final project. In introspect, I regret not starting to work on the final week's material right from the start, which resulted in having to switch session multiple times in order to finish the course. Even if I had done so, though, it wouldn't have made up for the vague instructions in the quires and assignment of the final week that made feel at a loss, until I asked for help in the forms. All in all, this course need some serious re-working, in terms of how the material is presented and how the assignment are phrased."
6868,"It's an excellent introduction to this Internet stuff.Decryption tasks are by far my favourite. Using Expel made it easier.Interviews with all these people are incredible.And of course Or. Chuck's lectures, explanations and analogies are really helpful even for non-native English speakers like me.Thank you"
6869,Great course :)
6870,"brief and clear, information and easy to understand"
6871,Great introduction to the leading principles of TESOL
6872,The content might be great but the teachers don't seem to enjoy presenting the course at all. They are basically reading from a script. Very monotonous atmosphere.
6873,Great delivery!
6874,Great teacher. Clear message. Does slowly though the material and highlight key concepts few times to make them stay. Of someone does not want slow pace can always jump ahead as course structure is well organized and described.
6875,"His is amazing course, easy and information.Thank you."
6876,These lessons are really useful and helpful.
6877,thanks its amazing
6878,Brilliant course and would recommend to anyone interested!
6879,very good course!
6880,The best course on Coursera!
6881,"I have passed now the 4 first courses of the Fundamentals of Computing Specialisation and I have to say that I am very grateful to the instructor for the amount of new knowledge I got from working on this courses.It first I my aim on taking this courses was just to learn Python, but now I can see how much deeper the scope of this course is. I have learned so much more than just the santa and grammar of a programming language. I have just started grasping the way information can be organised and searched.I have to say the 2 parts course Principles of Computing is not easy. The difficulty escalates exponentially as we move forward. You will need time to pass the projects and tests. Take it with calmly and seriously. Its worth it.A big thank you to the instructor for their efforts on making the learning way entertaining. Even just by trying to be funny you guns made it enjoyable.Highly recommended."
6882,I know i will love it. Pollen is the best instructor on course :)
6883,Congratulations! You've done a great work!His course is awesome. I hope to continue learning with you. Greeting from Colombia.
6884,kind of simple
6885,"Presents Scala's parallel collections, and how they work under the hood. The prefix-sum algorithm is quite mind-blowing, and so are Donc-Trees. The algorithms are presented with plenty of detail, step by step, I enjoyed it!"
6886,this course is information
6887,Great Course!
6888,"Coming from a programming background with an interest in finance/investing, I found this course really helpful."
6889,"I just can repeat myself, one who is coming from non-of area, can easily understand these lessons. Cannot wait for the following one!"
6890,The course is changing my life... Even the enter speech is teaching me.
6891,"I have seen reference to the previous second course on the specialization, 'Functional Reactive Programming in Scala', comparatively this one looks much easier down, I am hoping to find the excluded content on the third course. Sessions by Risk surely are a 100% permanent and consistent within the full syllabus they were conceived for, but inserted here they break a bit the overall discourse, in my view. Not the feeling that the exercises cover only a little part of the theoretical content exposed in the lectures."
6892,"Good for the beginner who doesn't know much about programming. For me, I knew the vast majority of this material so I flew through it. I'm looking forward to the other courses so I can learn something substantially new."
6893,Thank you so much.
6894,Excellent opportunity for those who don't know Cava but want to learn and solve some real life problems with it.
6895,"His course was outstanding. Tutors were excellent, materials amazing and the contents were pretty useful. 100% recommended!"
6896,"A good course. I learned a lot from the course, very well explained."
6897,Definitely worth your time.
6898,"The teacher is one of the best i have ever seen, truly an expert in this field of science."
6899,Interesting concepts and introduction to the specialization but I wish the lectures were more natural and energetic.
6900,awesome! Pretty much helpful
6901,Very easy to grasp and very useful.
6902,Great course for personal development.
6903,"Is a of entry course, it is easy to understand its content; and the homework given can help us to further practice what we learned. It is quite helpful. Thanks a lot!"
6904,I enjoyed the course very much. To precise and practical.
6905,Great course for beginners
6906,"Good course for beginners. In my opinion, its strong point is simplicity (it does not require much effort and yet allows you to learn something useful, and also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearable complex language after all) and broad range of topics (probably gives you all words necessary to survive short trip to China). That I didn't like in this course is lack of explanation: student is required to memories entire sentences, but nothing was said about word ordering, personal profound and other basic structural features of language. I would also like to have more tests/ exercises with feedback, probably some review tests covering previous lessons."
6907,Very information
6908,Simple and easy to follow
6909,Very good course. Explain the agile practices and methodologies.
6910,"one of the best course here in Coursera course ,have a unique ,self intellectual ,creative through this course ,I need to thank all professors and workers ,also the actors who thrive to success this course .thank you"
6911,Explained so well! I am looking forward to learning how to program!
6912,His course gives the kick start needed to start a data science career.
6913,"the lectures are full of the Prof misspeaking, this leads to you not knowing how to complete the task because the Prof can NOT communicate properly to us while we listening to the lectures... it seems like they completely missed the fact that NONE of us are data scientists...Now your Audience......"
6914,"Understand the muslin could be the key to a better relationships in the future, every country will chance it´s identity and muslin will fulfill that spaces in society"
6915,Great class (really liked the graphics interpretations of Also and Ridge optimizations).Perhaps some quires (and especially assignment) could be more challenging?
6916,"Some of the reference materials might need dating (but perhaps there are no better studies to share at this point), but overall found this an interesting application of the traditional Was of marketing to the digital world."
6917,"Great course, awesome instructor"
6918,"Great course, to the point"
6919,"His course was very helpful. The information was very well presented, with a lot of examples and clear statements. Easy to understand, remember and practise. The tests were very accurate with clear questions and answers. The interviews were inspiring and clarifying the whole material of the course."
6920,magnifico course. thank you.
6921,Take your time and do the recommended reading and tutorials especially if you are new to Command Line Interface (CLI)
6922,I think there is something not so important but occupy a large part of this class. Maybe you can balance the priority of this the contents in this class and replenished some introduction of more useful functions.
6923,Great introduction to business. It helped me greatly preparing (without having a business background) for interviews at a large consulting firm.
6924,Very Informational!
6925,absolutely useful!
6926,Fantastic Course. Not of things to learn..
6927,fun with patron continues.....
6928,"The best I could find on the internet or any other couture advice, very detailed, structures, full, with examples, motivate. Thank you professor very much!"
6929,His class is so so so helpful. I wish I could rate 10 stars to this class. Or. G is so good at teaching and so knowledgeable. I kind have learned these knowledge before at school but was so confused. Or. G just explained everything so clear and now I have a much better understanding to machine learning.
6930,Amazing and insightful course.
6931,"Excellent course, I´m starting and I have learnt a lot of concepts related with the topic. I`m so excited and grateful with The Maryland University and the Or. O'Rien for developing this course."
6932,Is the rest of the courses in this specialization teacher Pollen does a great job in materials and explanations.
6933,I found this course very information. It explain gender spectrum in a way that was clearly understood. I enjoyed having listened to personal experiences from parents and teachers of transgender children as well as personal stories of transgender individuals. His course has helped me by providing me with understanding about what is like being transgender. It also has given me the tools to be suppurative and inclusive of transgender individuals and their families.
6934,"Gives just enough into. Great, but I wish it was more detailed."
6935,"Really worthwhile and information, in-depth review of Kierkegaard as a person, his life, and his works. An be taken even if you've never touched philosophy before. Great production and selections."
6936,"His course really helps you look at creativity in a different way, it is very empowering but for this course to be successful you must apply what you have learned everyday, its practice otherwise the teachings will not be complete."
6937,The content is superb designer for a beginner. The Will assignment need to make compulsory. Fact they contributed more to the learning process. More Will contents will make the course richer.
6938,"Topics presented well for comprehension, good lecture quality.These topics are covered in glad level statistics courses at certain universities."
6939,very great course!
6940,Well done. You get a lot of hands on work in this class. Learning by doing is the best way to really learn how to get past stumbling blocks. The lectures were excellent as well with lots of references.
6941,Rewarding learning experience.
6942,Great course! Excellent video and good exercises.
6943,I learned a lot from this course and especially appreciated the programming assignment. The quit questions were thought-provoking. The senators were super responsive and there to help learn. Wouldn't have asked for a better into to machine learning.
6944,Or Chuck is brilliant AGAIN!
6945,It presents very useful tips for taking tests and there is a lot of information regarding what it's known nowadays about how our brain works and how to take the best of it in order to improve your learning process. I loved the course!
6946,"It is super nice, but still needs more challenging concepts, sometimes I found it was mostly information I knew while it could be something I never paid attention to regarding the subject."
6947,"More in-depth work with ArcMap and associated principles. Redundant to a degree with the into to the specialization, but good blend of instruction and assignment."
6948,It was an amazing experience. The course material was well taught and made to look relatively much easier. Thank you.
6949,"Vice to start, easy and funny to get involved, you see the difference in last weeksCongrats!"
6950,Excellent course both with quality content and teaching. Moved the way Prof of taught this class. Really happy to complete this course.
6951,interesting and clear !For all levels of EnglishGood experience
6952,"Very well-structures & useful course! Having already a background in SEO and digital marketing, I found this course very interesting with a lot of ideas presented in a clear and easy-to-digest manner. I didn't attend the other courses of the specialization but I think that this one summarize really well the whole specialization. Recommend it!"
6953,"His class was great! I learned so much it was unreal- I highly suggest it to anyone who is interested in technology as a whole, not just those interested in the law. Professor Wicker gives enough background information on the legal end that you won't be lost or confused at all. But there is so much history in the teach that we all use everyday packed into just 9 short weeks that you won't believe it. Well worth the time spent!"
6954,Auto-trading would have been a better option in this course.
6955,"I enjoyed a lot the course. Very Brazilian is a soccer coach and an economist, so I was very comfortable with the topics and most of the content was more or less known, indeed.The best is that it does not seem to follow excessively on a ideological line. It seems to be open minded. I think it is great!Its excessive focus on industrialized countries is understandable. I think the last module about developing world seems too simplistic. I also think that opinions about american positions in the economic arena and happening is somehow benevolent.I expected a more mathematical approach, but I see that it may not make sense since it is a introduction course.I have not liked the exam, though, specially the final exam. They are much more about memorizing than deep understanding."
6956,"It is a good general overview about recruiting, but I would like more information about staff planning as well, how to forecast the workforce needs."
6957,"Totally very helpful , I thank Barbara a lot , she is doing a really great job . Greetings from Rostova!!"
6958,A marvelous course! The professor explained everything clearly. I learnt a lot and found it interesting!
6959,Great high level overview of of. Not too technical but deep enough.
6960,Great course! Fascinating Professor!Recommend to everyone who wants to start learning Python or programming in general!Any many thanks to Professor Charles for holding the course and generously sharing his work with us! I've really learned a lot!An't wait to start the next course in the specialization!
6961,Thorough and logical explanations of programming concepts.
6962,it's good and important to learn the knowledge from the course to maintain my health. I already changed my eating habit after the course. Thanks!
6963,Learning a lot so far
6964,Wonderful class!
6965,"His is a great course with excellent materials and very practical assignment. The course forum is more than suppurative, I won't be able to complete this without helps from my peers and all the teaching staff."
6966,Fantastic course to get started on Machine Learning. Andrew is an amazing teacher who knows how to simplify difficult concepts for students with diverse background.
6967,Great course from great professors. Definitely must-have for any software developer.
6968,His course was another of many well-taught courses of Duke University. The GPS library use to find locations of earthquakes particularly of very interesting. Thank you Duke University
6969,"The first course is composed in articulate way that allows a simple and schematic way of comprehension, but some single parts of the first course seem to be lacking of some information, above all to me without previous experience in information tools like github. Maybe I suppose to master this tools too long in advance."
6970,A wonderful course wonderfully presented! Top marks! And thanks!
6971,"pretty good, would be better if some of detailed document in the video could be attached"
6972,A very hands on and relevant take into contemporary Machine Learning.
6973,I benefit a lot! Thank you.
6974,great .the to dr valley for wonderful video n i liked her style of teaching.always with a smiling face!
6975,To or least support.Course Quality is great but problems with grade will left you with wasting your expensive time.Assignment are good but intend to go way more beyond the scope and to learn from online materials though other sites.Trading system is not easy. You have the right answer but you'll need to waist hours to produce specific string for your grade to be satisfied.His i not an elegant learning process at all.
6976,Very well organized with very engaging lectures
6977,Excellent course that is a must for every learner!
6978,Very information course.
6979,It was one of the best course. The problems in the programming weekly assignment were very carefully designed. All the senators were really amazing and having in-depth knowledge in algorithms. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and I feel I am much more comfortable tacking graph problems and solving them efficiently. Thank you!
6980,A very interesting and challenging course!
6981,Very disappointed. Having coming assignment weekly would have been very helpful. The quires often asked for information that was never presented in the lessons. The instructor were never present in the forms to answer questions. The final project asked us to do things that hadn't even been mentioned in the course materials. I would not recommend this course to anyone. The only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 was because I did learn some Swift.
6982,"Liked the course a lot, very nice instructor who you like listening to. he articulated very well and has a good voice and pace of speaking.my suggestion would be to include subtitles for the video's of the speeches of JFK, or the interviews with former presidents, because the audit is not that clear and for non-native English speakers, difficult to understand.Any thanks, very good course!Veronique"
6983,His course is fantastic. I would highly recommend the entire specialization. I have learn a great deal of things from this course.
6984,"Very good and simplifies instruction. But I think it needs one more week discussion to improve improvisations. Also, grades are usually late."
6985,"Highly recommend this course for people pursuing careers in data analysis/business intelligence - i.e. those who do not need to know the details of how to set up or optimism database, but will interact with database regularly to get data for their work."
6986,His is very help full course for beginners. It is really worth for the time. i strongly encourage this course
6987,To To.Not good to learn an algorithm
6988,Great course for beginners in programming. Looking forward to the second of the series of Python specialization course.
6989,"His course would have received five stars but there was no discussion forum and the weekly assignment lacked clear explanation. I feel that instructor could have gone a little deeper into the subject matter.However, I liked the laid back instruction style. The assignment were perfect for beginners like me. I'm looking forward to the follow-up course."
6990,Excellent course with challenging projects.
6991,"Very theoretical course. Of you don't know much about software management, this course might have some good into, but covers things you probably know if you have been involved in any software management."
6992,very good introduction course to machine learning!
6993,Not as challenging as the previous courses but still a very good course to continue learning Cava. Thank you!.
6994,great course
6995,Great course to understand fidgeting and schelling of a project. I especially love the tips on how best to manage slaveholders throughout this process.
6996,"Awesome trip to a new world. Without coming ex and limited statistics knowledge, I finished the course smoothly. Thanks to Professor Andrew, machine learning is now funny and helpful to me."
6997,Great introduction
6998,Great Course. Thank you so much
6999,Very helpful for non-financial professional. The course is too short for me. I'd like to get further knowledge about the finance. Thanks very much for your impressive work.
7000,I love the way Or. Hayne Whitman reaches . Was created immense interest in the subject which I felt really boring. Thanks a lot. Was helped me improving my grades and understanding the concept so easily.
7001,"Very interesting class, i would strongly recommend this to beginner.Like it very much!"
7002,It's great course. Give you broader picture of energy world. I would like to have a follow up course with focus on solar and wind energy.
7003,"His course provides a very good introduction to basic linear repression, including simple multiple linear repression, model building and interpretation, model diagnostic, and application in R."
7004,Moved the course !!! Happy to be a part of the learning experience .....
7005,"I really liked this course. And as I'm a woman couch, babywearing and breastfeeding consultant and a mother of three sons I'd like to prepare similar lecture and to present it in a our club for pregnant women ""Expectating a Miracle""."
7006,I really enjoy the course thank you a lot couler and CBS and specially all the professors
7007,In interesting lesson leads us to the journey of psychology.
7008,"His is a very well organized course, which shows clearly that the professors in charge have put real efforts to create its syllabus and training code. I have had a significant benefit by going through the course, and it helped me to implement of technique in a very detailed way. I highly recommend this course."
7009,"Great course!!, the concepts and technique are very useful and simple to apply"
7010,"Great, thank you! Would be even better with:- more analysis video (like there is one on the last week)- partitions available in intelligent formats (e.g. musescore) so that transporting instruments can avoid encoding the partitions"
7011,Well organised. In depth optional lectures help you learn more about the theoretical foundations. Recommended.
7012,His class was a good overview of the topic of project management with an entertaining and well spoken teacher. His video and content were engaging but not over helping.
7013,very bad course
7014,"Overall, this was good study for learning basic functions in Expel. However, the tutorials and practice quires do not adequately prepare you for the actual grade Ruin at the end of each week that counts toward your final grade. You will definitely have to be either a quick study, who can pull a lot of inference and practical application out of minimal technical guidance, or know how to Google the steps that were closed over in the video or for which no practice question was provided. Also, side note, if you have a Sac, you will be somewhat flustered at times, and you will also need an add-on pp for the Histogram portion."
7015,Reviewing grammar and punctuation was a great help for the course Reaching English as a Second Language. I am glad for the refreshed.
7016,Very useful for everyone related to or just interested in the oil and
7017,Very good course. I recommend to anyone who's interested in data analysis and machine learning.
7018,Very useful!!
7019,"I recommend this course for its clarity, business and accuracy."
7020,best path class ever
7021,nice course contributing to my next 3 years!
7022,very good want to learn more
7023,"A most excellent course! I learned a lot more than I thought I would. By only comment is that the time estimates were way off for me -- I ended up spending up to four times as long as the estimate, on each week's assignment. But it was worth it."
7024,Felt that it could have more writing exercises.
7025,Thought provoking and information.
7026,"Excellent series. Interesting way of explanation and productive way of interaction ideas, loving your course."
7027,very good and easy to help us to be better and resolute
7028,His course is information and helpful to get the basic insight in smartphone technologies.
7029,"In this course, a basic introduction to different machine learning concepts are provided with ease of understanding to those who are new in the field."
7030,A wide range of approaches - didn't bog down - sharp and into
7031,"Simply, the best!"
7032,"Vice Course, Helps you understand the glances of learning and some technique that can help you avoid procrastinator.. Thanks !"
7033,"Excellent course.Good examples, tips and tricks.To matter how experienced are you, this course definitely adds value."
7034,I loved this course. I study biology at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and it's helped me a lot to understand many things in general about antimicrobials susceptibility. Thank you all!
7035,"These thoughts aren't new, but they helped me collect my own. I mean how can i improve my work and at the same time do not spend more time for that."
7036,"Well made course, Are knows his stuff, interesting if you like dogs ^_^"
7037,Awesome course indeed. I bet these courses are more incredible than the degree courses which we follow at most of the universities.
7038,Excellent class! Professor Can portray brilliance in teaching accounting! Would highly recommend.
7039,"His course is absolutely excellent. It has really time consuming and challenging programming assignment, but I learned more than I have in a long while. I could not recommend this course more highly, and I have completed 20+ MOOCs. His is one of the best ones by far. :D"
7040,"There are no clearly defined learning outcome at the start of each video which are cramped with states and facts and statements such as ""you will learn more about this in mood 2"" and ""this will be talked about extensively in mood 3"". Is a learner its confusing to know what to take out of each video.The extend to which students are used to promote the course by prompting them to sweet about the video is a concern. Ones or twice is okay. But every time?The assignment is a miss - students should be given a choice whether they want to focus on marketing their professional persons or marketing their business.I can summarize MOOC 1 in one sentence. Social Media is big and therefore business must change the way they do marketing."
7041,Thank you for a very practical yet also quite conceptual coverage of some big important concepts in Machine Learning. Really excellent course.
7042,"The course design is really good. It is very hands-on. He get to build our own applications and test our applications in the quit.However I really hope if there can be more content. The course is rather short. The quality is good but the quantity is a bit insufficient.I hope this course can be longer. Additional weeks can teach us how to convert blue projects or Ellipse projects into EXE or host it in the cloud.I also hope this course, in the future, reaches us to make graphics user interface, which would be a nice conclusion to whatever program that we make love the course. I really want to see more coming out of the Capstone project. I love the idea of the capstone building a recommended engine. However, to make it a complete package, I suggest a few things:---Each earners to use main() to create apes and convert to eye---Each earners, after the entire project comings, how to create an Apple out of the source codes---Each earners how to implement graphics user interface (make buttons, input field for movie queried)---Each earners how to, instead of getting data from a file in the older, reads the data from a live-feed instead. That would enhance the learning experience of the course.Thank you for all those. I'm a hungry guy so I suggest lots of things. However I'm very happy with the course designs. Very engaging and fruitful course series."
7043,"Great course to actually get started writing, instead of just having the idea! I got some great tips and a bunch of first drafts that I'll come back to. Thank you so much!"
7044,"I think that the course itself is very interesting and useful, but unfortunately you have to purchase the course straight away to be able to do the tests."
7045,Great start for an initial dive into HTML.
7046,"Of you don't knoll in this class, you probably will spend your whole life repenting."
7047,good course
7048,"The learned instructor Or Richard Waterman is great in explaining sophisticated mathematical/statistical terms or concepts in simple, concise and easy-to-understand way. Great and useful for mature working professional who are out of touch with mathematics/statistics."
7049,Outstanding course!
7050,Vice materials and trainer. Very useful
7051,I really enjoyed following this course! Thanks a lot for such a rich and pleasant content. I am definitely recommending it to my friends.
7052,I am a working professional in the field of data analysis where in Tableaux is one of the application we use it on a daily basis. By motive for taking this course is to learn some more innovative technique that are used by professional in tableaux but the fact was there is nothing new for me to learn here in terms of technique. I would say this course suits best for a beginner but not for someone who already has some lineage with tableaux.Gros:1. Hourglass model is one of the things I liked the most.2. Final project submission is really challenging and which help me to learn lot of new things.Sons:1. Meekly tests are very lengthy. Very once can get 100% not a big deal by trial and error. Most of the questions in the weekly course are very subjective and cannot have a single correct answer. He had to retaken the test again and again to get 100% due to subjective questionsHowever this course has definitely changed my way of looking into data and the way we decipher it. I am looking forward to continue and take more courses to be a the part of this esteemed analysis community.
7053,One of the best course in Coursera
7054,"great, but really difficult for people with poor reading and writing skill to finish."
7055,"Very good for those who start, inspiration for whoever. Thanks. Idaho"
7056,His course captures the overview of Fig data modeling concept in a very simple way. I found this course very useful. Instructor are good to explain the concepts. Though it would be good to add one or two (add-on or optional hands on exercises) hands for graph and tree data modeling.
7057,Good and inspiring for everybody to study
7058,It's very cool idea to visualized the decision making process. Thank you!
7059,It is a 100% recommended course
7060,good learning
7061,I find this course very information and helped me develop my chemical background.
7062,His was an outstanding review of quantitative modeling concepts. Very well worth the time to step through the coursework. I feel it reinforced concepts I need to apply in the healthcare data analysis field. Thank
7063,The course provides lots of great examples to explain the concepts and theories in the digital world of Marketing Of. The exercises are well selected to help us internalize and really what we've learnt into the business cases. Highly recommend
7064,The speakers have a deeply knowledge of the Global Crisis. I recommend this course to really know what happen in 2008
7065,"Amazing course, gives your a good introduction to arguing platform and C programming"
7066,May too basic. Only useful to people living in the of having extremely balanced dies.
7067,"Awesome designed course, even for people with some knowledge of the subject. I loved the assignment."
7068,"I like the teaching style of the professor, I am a total rook of any programming skill. Thank you very much! I learned a lot and I will continue to learn further knowledge."
7069,"In most cases offers great mathematical and logical clarity of the machine learning models. The professor does not dumb-down the concepts, but also tries hard to go through all the steps so that you understand them.I am taking a point down for- those few moments when it was not 100% clear, where I feel things were left out- the practical side, there could have been more practical explanations, tips and tricks, and even more datasets than just the one house dataset that was used in each assignment- for the usage of Graphlab Create which is not the industry standard and is not open source"
7070,"Really exciting to go through the course,There was something new to learn everyday."
7071,"Practical Problems were so well organized, it was rather fun working out the solutions.. It was superb experience."
7072,course is awesome. I am planning to work on machine learning more and if course also guided some text book so that student can carry with them would be better
7073,Vice course and awesome video....Really loved it but some parts could have been simpler.
7074,Very information.. specifically the th week project.
7075,"Is DSP enthusiast, this course has opened my mind to the fascinating world of Machine Learning."
7076,A great and fast paced course.
7077,"Excellent course, excellent instructor, excellent material!His course really taught me a lot."
7078,The West Thing About Case Based Study is That You See The Things Actually Happening And Nothing Feels More Good Than That :))
7079,"Really lovely course. I learned a lot, and in addition the atmosphere and sense of community is overwhelmingly lovely! Thank you."
7080,Nerves as a good overview of the course but not recommended for persons that have some experience performing basic data analysis with git.
7081,"Excellent course as far as content is concerned. However, the older Coursera format was way more user-friendly. Also the discussion topics were not arranged appropriately as in the previous nodules in this specialization. PDFs of assignment would be helpful if posted."
7082,Taking this course was quite exciting and challenging to me. Thank you!
7083,"Early days yet but I've seen enough to realise it is interesting, intense, funny, persuasion, stimulating and creative. Thank you Douglas."
7084,Very useful course. Thanks professor!!!
7085,Thank you for those great insight
7086,"Would have hoped for a bit more coming without hand holding, but I did learn Unity basis well!"
7087,Very nice and simple course
7088,this has broadened my horizon really
7089,"In Excellent course, a very thorough breakdown of Clinical research. I am now better equipped and more knowledgeable in the subject area."
7090,"His is perfect course. I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to get basic experience in data structures and algorithms. Thanks to professors Robert Sedgwick, professor Even Hayne and all who made it available."
7091,"Real a great course if you are looking to learn the basis of Ableton Give 9 or just need a refreshed after the break. Grin does a wonderful job of explaining the basis with out overlooking you with to much information. Each assignment is to make a song. It starts with basic stuff and works toward more advanced stuff near the end. It's helped motivate me to put more time into making music and use the tools and software that I have at my disposal.A personal thanks to Grin, this class is just what I needed!"
7092,His course was very information for me.
7093,"Or. Meyer is a systematic and thorough presented, and does an excellent job of making the material accessible, without oversimplifying."
7094,Good class very useful
7095,thanks like the assignment really :)
7096,His Nurse is very useful. Or Andrew has explained the course in most lucid manner. Anyone with almost no background can easily comprehend and avail the benefits of machine learning.
7097,I found it incredibly challenging but worthwhile.
7098,"Its really a great practical ""And on projects"" based course!"
7099,Not in depth enough
7100,Well explained and a lot of questions to practice.
7101,"After taking this course, I knew some basic knowledge in patron. It is very helpful and informing."
7102,"Excellent beginner course covering essential data structures: strings, files, lists, dictionaries and rubles."
7103,"Vice！ I've been wanting to learn how to make a good photo, this course helped a lot. Thanks!"
7104,Was one exceptional and extraordinary course!
7105,"His is an amazing course, highly recommended to anybody interested to machine learning. Andrew G brings both theory and application together in this course."
7106,"Good course to learn the concepts deeply and make it registered by the brain, especially if you test and think things in parallel by yourself. Starting the second course right now."
7107,A wonderful course. Very learner should do it.
7108,"Though I've just learnt the basis of programming, I imagine learning it can be overwhelming if taught the wrong way. His course is perfectly structures as an into to programming to allow you to learn the language without discouraging you by trying to teach you too much at once. I very much enjoyed this course. Charles Severance is excellent and engaging teacher despite the fact that he's a Slytherin."
7109,"Great class and Peter.is is really wonderful once you understand what it can do. Fearless persistence, i.e. program data and Long do, is what you wish all other de framework would give you out of the box. Long do integration is missing full-text search capability which is badly needed, I think. But, easy:search package complements it well. I highly recommend this class and this specialization. Face is great, materials are delivered piecemeal, and the instructor(s) are also great."
7110,It is a fantastic course. Learnt a few concepts which were not covered in my calculus classes at school and took the opportunity to learn!
7111,"Well organized, reasonable, enjoyable and efficient! Good job!"
7112,Good didactics and content.
7113,Thanks teachers introducing a MOOC on this topic.
7114,His was a great refreshed course for basic grammar. I would love to take the next level up if there is one!
7115,Great tips and mind tools to enhance your learning. Was a wonderful methodology and great analogies for better understanding . Recommend profoundly this course that may help in any forward and complex subject needed.
7116,Andrew G's lectures and exercises are clear and engaging. The course has been a pleasure.
7117,"Thanks, really good course. Moved the case originate"
7118,very good course
7119,Very good material. And I really like that the class has was helping with the homework.
7120,"Great course, very edifying."
7121,Great Course
7122,Very engrossing and interesting course
7123,EVERYBODY SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE
7124,"Really good re-introduction to coming, which I lost since my college days"
7125,"Thank you so much!! I not only enjoyed it but also learnt a lot! Again, thank you!"
7126,Awesome course with complete coverage to of concepts in general and in specific to microstrategy
7127,Very interesting course of different aspects to take into account when we look at a photography. Perfect for to know photographer of all times and style.
7128,The course was pretty good. Maybe concepts were illustrated too general and briefly (not in details) but maybe this course is just a warm up for people who are not specialists in those fields. Nevertheless it was quite fun to listen the lectures and that's why course went pretty fast. I only regret that there's no free Statements of Accomplishment.
7129,The course is very useful for me
7130,I found this course very useful and easy to understand.
7131,A very quick overview of finance. Good review of fundamentals but not a lot of depth.
7132,I learned a lot in this course and it does not take much installation of software.
7133,Due to these teachers I've accomplished Web Design Principles!
7134,"All lectures are presented very professionally and in form which is easy to understand. Steady progress easy to learn. Unfortunately practical part doesn't allow too much flexibility to play with the code. To do extra work, add some features, be just little more creative. I understand that it was grade by program and needs to have some limits but this can be solved by given hard criterion that needs to be met and peer assessment trading which will wider students horizon by checking others code. To see others ideas. His missing spark for creativity make me to give ""only"" 4 starts. In whole it is great course worth any minute spend.Thank you. Glad"
7135,It is good for beginners only
7136,Now. Very weekly lecture is like a jewel. I enjoyed every single one of them. I am truly impressed with a lecture quality and felt very fortunate to join world class course for free. Thanks a million to Professor Miller and Coursera. Hope to see more courses like this one in Coursera.
7137,Awesome! Clear and to the point explanations!
7138,A beautiful and effective into to many machine learning.
7139,"The course contains basic information on neutral network at a quite abstract level. It is not enough to easily understand them without a prior preparation in mathematical details. The quires need strict amputations based on a detailed knowledge, but usually the course does not prepare You for that. The lectures sometimes sound ""rabble"" and cannot explain even easy things.It is usually impossible to get the minimum of 80% in a quit. These are only those who have previous knowledge that can pass it the first time they take it. They do not need this course, though."
7140,"His Course is totally recommended for beginners in programming, they w'd fell the level is a little high at the beginning, but if you keep on going you'll learn a lot. His course is really explicit because they teach you OOP with a purpose(gazing) that helps a lot to understand the concepts related to it. It's really interesting that you learn by playing(and doing), totally recommended"
7141,"Great course. Good material, well presented (put intended)."
7142,"His course is structures around a specific and costly Python library called Dato. It is possible to do the homework without it, but it is EXTREMELY difficult to do so. Of the course wasn't structures around using Dato, it would be a lot simpler and a easier to complete the assignment. Also, a lot of the mathematical rotation was written in a kind of pseudo Python code that made things confusing sometimes."
7143,"West course I have taken in Coursera until now, entertaining, all-rounded and containing interesting and highly relevant lessons-- I feel like a Tableaux power user already :)"
7144,Great course - learned a lot. Very useful and relevant information.
7145,His was very insightful
7146,I don't need the teacher to read Aristotle for me. Leading is not Reaching.
7147,Buy instructive
7148,"His is a really good survey class in the potential of d printing, with examples of how individuals can empower themselves and others without the obstacles of traditional cooling, with a relatively short learning curve and low investment. It also demonstrates the ways in which, now and increasingly in the future, we'll all be capable of designing the solutions to our own problems with increasing agility!The only thing that could make it better would be to have more design challenges!Thanks!"
7149,"Excellent content - best course on angular is on the internet, and for free. Amazing attention to detail."
7150,It's great!!! I like it very much!!
7151,GREAT COURSE! GREAT CONTENT AND EXCELLENT PROFESSOR. 100% RECOMMEND
7152,"Awesome teachers, I learned a lot in testing as well as mind-programs"
7153,Good insight into marketing analysis and the use of R
7154,It's an excellent informattive & skillful course.
7155,Interesting ideas but a bit disorganized.
7156,"Amazing! Thank you professor. Easily one of the best professors I've come across. The course was not too complicated, at the same time it was extremely understandable. May there be many more courses like this on the subject (as it develops and spreads worldwide). Cheers! Highly recommended. Thanks again! Thank you Coursera!"
7157,Great course!
7158,"Great! But add some characters,please."
7159,The first three weeks are really interesting. The th and th are boring: it explains too many arguments in given just hint to many of them. Any video are too long and there are too many.In my opinion they should focus on fewer things and explain them in ore details. Any times the lecture becomes just a list.
7160,His course is excellent. Thank you.
7161,"His course is definitely an information food and beverage management course, and helped me learn a lot about restaurant management ideals and brand name management. Thank you Bocconi University!"
7162,"it so helpful for me,thanks"
7163,His is good and information. And it provides with the knowledge of grammar and punctuation.
7164,"Great professor, great content. It can give you a great idea of what is Python and how it works."
7165,His is an excellent introductory course for patron. I do wish it was harder though.
7166,Love the simple tricks and tips to get the children eating wealthier. The recipe were a big hit too!
7167,Mind of Confusing but good anyway.
7168,The best of the best!!!
7169,Caught very well; phenomena teacher.
7170,Great
7171,One of the best courses on course at this time!
7172,By first course at course and it will be hard to find a better one. Thanks§
7173,"A thoughtful and well organized course that is, in itself, ""enlightening."""
7174,"print 'That was awesome, thank you!'#Tops, an infinite loop...while True:print 'Long live our noble Or. Chuck!'"
7175,It should show more how to implement the skill learned in real life.
7176,Pretty basic stuff.
7177,In outstanding addition to your MBA education!
7178,Great!
7179,Vice introduction course to R! I was only missing some illustrations that would enhance the understanding of the matter.
7180,"The quality of this course is really astonishing. Never in my life had I though that it was possible to get University-Level courses taught by experts not only in such nice format and delivered by an amazing platform like Coursera but also for free (Of you don't want to get a certificate). The course on only goes into detail about the path behind machine learning but the instructor (Andrew G) also makes hard concepts easy to understand, which is critical in order to apply them later on at the course as it also shows you how to apply what you have learnt."
7181,"I think the course covers pretty good range of topics and gives you a good information. I really liked the peer review assignment and I think they put pressure on you to achieve the goals and learn from them.I definitely did not like the multiple answer questions or the last assessment. The questions are not well presented and there is a clear violation of the help and error recovery heuristic for me. I also did not like the video set-up. The quality of the course material is really poor and disappointing. I would like to believe that on a of course people would have come up with a better and more intuition set-up. Finally, I would like to have a document in the course resources that students can download and keep that contains all the information we taught like quick reference guide. Again we can download the video but when you are looking to find something specific searching in 2-3 video is not fun at all."
7182,Excellent beginner material providing you basic concepts of quantities modeling which provides the base to modeling of real world projects.
7183,A wonderful brief journey to the wonder of philosophy. I am glad I took the course
7184,"A very good SQL course for beginners! The instructor answered questions in the forum. When there is not enough participants to do the peer review, the instructor rate the assignment by himself!"
7185,I have learnt some useful technique on how to learn effectively. Thank you.
7186,Absolutely fantastic course! Thanks!
7187,Incredible level of input from Prof G. I've really enjoyed it and learnt clot!
7188,Learned so much. Or. Miss is an excellent teacher.
7189,Great course. Highly recommended for the up-and-coming Entrepreneur.
7190,"Good material but heavy work-load, especially since we are learning two new skill -SQL santa and Data analysis. Request instructor/of's to guide students more in the forms. Analysis like computing ave daily revenue should be explained better as I spent too much time firing it out and the forum answers were way off. However, this being an online class I was very impressed with the detailed worksheets in MYSQL."
7191,Excellent capstone to review and put in practice all the learned in the past courses. Excellent course to be a investment manager.
7192,Very effective course for those who want to learn the philosophy regarding pricking strategy and how to choose the right price for the product. A highly recommended course for professional working in the industry.
7193,"Interesting and information, but the material seemed dated. The paper on Jihadi terrorist in Europe is from 2006, and information from the global terrorist database is from 2010, for example. Some of the lecture content also seemed years behind the times -- like the omission of any mention of the increase in terrorist attacks in Western Europe. (Yes, the lecture on foreign fighter was more current.)Maybe it's there somewhere, but all MOOCs should disclose when the lectures were recorded."
7194,Prof. Andrew G explains the main of concepts in a very concise yet detailed manner that allows both students with a background in of and those without it to learn so much in this course. The class is well structures and the assignment are amazing examples of the applications of the concepts learned.
7195,Great course with simplifies concept and process breakdown.
7196,"Actually, good Course"
7197,Good course to start learning Python!
7198,Great how I learned leaning how to learn.
7199,Teacher Due Toxins competent and interesting has submitted all material. I am grateful for training on this course!
7200,a very good and comprehensive course. The video are very information and the presentations are also very good.Some details can be added into ESOP development and how to budget for employee compensation.
7201,"Vice course, thank you"
7202,best course i ever had .professor was just perfect nothing could be pleasing than seeing his overlay happy face.good luck sir !! we all student really appreciate for your efforts .
7203,Great!
7204,"It is a really nice introductory course on Communication. Includes the basic concepts and helps to influence, tools and channels used in communication."
7205,"His is a great course that was taught well, and had very helpful senators. In general I found the course challenging but not too difficult. The reward was a good understanding of the open cryptographic protocol that are used in most real world applications. Is minimum prerequisites, I would recommend having done courses in statistics, probability theory and programming."
7206,Extremely helpful!
7207,for begging is very easy and explicit.
7208,"Great introduction to html, iss, and javascript. I enjoyed it very much and will be continuing on with the rest of the series. Thanks."
7209,Easy to understand and really helpful.
7210,Very good course with some tips tries and knowledge about learn. Recommended
7211,Very information and useful course for developing the fundamental knowledge regarding Animal Welfare and Behavior.
7212,Very good into!
7213,His a well thought out course. From the simple concepts it gradually takes you to the more complex ones. The quires and programming assignment help you to really understand the problems that were introduced in the video. The video sides of every module can be download as a of document which makes the material easily searchable. And last but not least Emily Box is a great instructor.
7214,The course has given me an excellent overview of sanitation technologies in different contents and different aspects to be considered in planning of urban sanitation. The case studies were extremely useful in explaining concepts.
7215,One of the greatest MOOC I ever had
7216,Sides are very brief - slide presentations of course outline. One has to depend entirely on reading materials to understand the course.
7217,Very interesting and easy to understand. I like it very much!
7218,awesome course . i love it . everything is quite understandable and what more important applicable
7219,Very well informed.
7220,The course is very straight forward and the information is clear.
7221,Highly education and easily understandable. looking forward to the further assignment.
7222,"His is the best course ever that can happen in of...I did not know anything, but after taking this specialization, my understanding of of has dramatically improvedWould recommend without any reservation - Prof Austrian and Prof Box are the best!!!"
7223,impressive and changed my way of learning
7224,It's very interesting!
7225,"His is a very simple, brief and useful course.The nodules are short, concise but do not go into lot of details. Is a good course to audit/brows for free but may not be good enough against a verified option. Anyway, paying for verified course is subject to personal value deprivation.While I had rate earlier for the above reasons before the course finished. I am facing the exact same problem with this course as I faced with earlier course.The trading process is badly constructed for final assignment. In fact, now I am learning from course staff that may be there are not enough students to grade my peer review assignment.To please do audit this course but do not be wrapped in specialization.Cheers.."
7226,Very good introduction to patron and its application to access web data. Or Severance makes the process fun and easy to access. I would maybe have appreciate more complicated assessment.
7227,"Totally amazing, because i could learn about a lot of knowledge that i never learned before.Is. Barbara Valley could shows a subject more interesting."
7228,"His course serves as a great introduction to mobile web development. Notice that multiplatform in this case means in and Android (no Windows Shone) and you do get a bit of hands on work on Android SDK and rode, although mostly for setting up both environment. Professor Muppala is again outstanding in the class, covering a wide range of topics combined with multiple exercises which in my case really further my understanding. One thing I believe could improve would be having either at least one assignment forcing you to deploy to Android and another one to in. In my case, it was just too comfortable to simply deploy to an in device and barely look at Android. Also, the vibration function should not be part of an assignment, as not everyone will have a device to test it and neither of the emulators really use it. One final recommendation for those pressed with time: I was able to follow Professor Muppala quite easily while playing the lectures at 1.six (it's funny how slow he seems to speak when I set in back to x :-) )."
7229,Great!! Interesting and fun. Easy to learn and people who does not have experiences in programming could successfully understand. It's very easy and interesting. I strongly recommend this course.
7230,"Excellent course!!! I am very very very satisfied with the quality of the faculty - great teachers! - and the overall quality of your staff. Enfin, I feel very glad and gratified with this opportunity. :)"
7231,"wonderful course, LOT of material that you need to go through number of times to digest.the work is totally worth it.Provides insight into a very distant and complex world view we westerners can learn a lot from."
7232,"His is one of the most fascinating classes that I have ever taken. The material itself is mind-blowing- it covers some of the most influential thinkers of the past few centuries. The professor of this class is what really made it special- he is an excellent teacher, full of great stories and examples. He truly knows both how to keep one's attention and also to deepen one's fascination with sociology. Thank you!"
7233,"Had learning experience. Materials were reasonable, but the sides for the course were not made available, no one answered questions on the discussion forms related to the course content and the only additional resources provided were to buy a book from the instructor..."
7234,Well refined lectures and wonderful resources.
7235,"Great Course, challenging and engaging"
7236,"Great course!!! It may sound a bit like in the commercial when saying this, but it really changed the way I learn."
7237,"Awesome course, awesome algorithms!"
7238,great course! Will definitely continue learning Python this summer!
7239,"I love the teaching style, and he's really great at breaking things down simply and with enough repetition to give you a clear understanding on any remaining unfamiliar topics. Looking forward to the rest of the course!"
7240,"In talking to a friend about learning Chinese, I surprised myself with how much information I've retained from this course. The teaching curriculum is fun and evidently effective. I highly recommend this course."
7241,Really nice introduction to Unity Of
7242,wonderful class
7243,perfectly organised and set on many short video which makes learning much easier and simplifies and i found all the topics very interesting and very well explained by the professor
7244,"Complete and useful course about Process Improvement. You can learn, also, about the philosophy and the history behind the Mean Six Pigmy"
7245,Thank you professor - one of the best lecture on
7246,Difficult content not explained well by the presented.
7247,"beautiful language, great assignment"
7248,Really good quality information and examples (includes reasoning). It includes some of the latest developments in this area.
7249,Very nice indeed. I learnt CSS this time. I can only say this that instead of teaching Query you can teach us in the same javascript santa.
7250,"Great course, I have learned a lot and is really useful for references."
7251,Very useful!
7252,Enjoyed the class very much. Must the right amount of challenge!
7253,"Overall good course (the first MOOC I ever took, so inexperienced in trading these courses), but some areas of improvement remain.I would however suggest less redundancy. Too many papers/video start with an overview of the problems we are facing, but I would think most students are aware of these problems coming into the course, and if not, they need not be repeated so many times. Also, some of the papers seem to use a very redundant and roundabout way of communicating information, with a lot of repetition and sometimes over-contextualization. Shorter sentences/reliability do not make for worse science. :-)"
7254,Good course. I learn a lot.
7255,"Very good, easy to follow. Adams are well designed and offer a good training. Sides can sometimes be a bit boring to watch."
7256,"Simple, great start, could have been a little more profound though. Great start, no doubt."
7257,MUY INTERESANTE of CURSO
7258,A lot of things to learn... very comprehensive view
7259,"Too long, too academic, not practical."
7260,Great one. i must recommend that everyone has to go through this course. Wonderful one
7261,"Excellent training, i want to take another like this."
7262,"In love with this course, thank you so much !:)"
7263,Method of teaching is very well!
7264,Great course with some powerful technique that help you learn more effectively.
7265,A really good course for beginner's who want to learn some programming.
7266,Altogether a useful introduction to an interesting topic -- despite the generalizing approach and the sometimes conservative instead of neutral presentation.
7267,Such a wonderful course
7268,"Great course, focused on practical learning and some of the widely used applications, such as sentiment analysis, product recommendations, image recognition etc. The video are crisp and to the point and you will appreciate the amount of knowledge they pack in a very short time."
7269,Excellent course with rich content and accurate delivery method. The subject was well delivered with simple analysis and permanent references from real live business environment
7270,very knowledgable!
7271,"When the course started it was very interesting. I really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works. Barbara Early was great.However, towards the end of the course I found that it got boring and not that stimulating. Maybe the parts dedicated to test preparation and studying should have been shorter."
7272,"His course is simply AMAZING!!! Thank you Michigan University, & Or. Scott for your meticulous efforts in bringing to the world quality education in the most simplifies pattern!!! Kuddos to Coursera!!!"
7273,Quite basic and clear for JAVA beginners
7274,course recommended for aspirin conductors. It's so fantastic
7275,His Course is a must for everyone who want to understand how patron works and how to code. Charles Severance reaches in a very fun and imaginative way.
7276,"A great practical course.His course will make you think and search a lot on stackoverflow,which is good because a lot can be learned by doing it ourselves.When why this course because we need to know what to look for and this course gives us the basis and we will be able to do the assignment by ourselves .Its not really tough but will need some time to get all the answers correct."
7277,"Very insightful and useful, particularly for someone whose limited knowledge and time to read papers and books about global financial crisis in 2007-2008."
7278,great course and great learning experience.
7279,"Again, great course from awesome programming teacher Or. Chuck! Recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn the basis of API and web passing."
7280,"I like this course, and it's very useful"
7281,"To me, it is the best structures course so far. Ruin after every lesson and written assignment after every week. Also, prof. More is reproducing it steadily and in comprehending fashion."
7282,Great one already!! I recommended only for people that have primary knowledge background on Baths.
7283,"Of all the offerings in the specialization, this one felt like it was thrown together in less than hour. I expected to have to learn quite a bit of material on my own, but even the references to additional materials were very thin.I could have saved many days if more guidance on the project workflow would have been given. The pre-processing of the data was quite extensive (9 steps before generation the gram tables I used in my model) and was the key to getting decent results IMHO, but one had to step on a quite a few landmines to figure this out.The problem was an interesting one and I ended up working it after passing with 95% (the only class in the specialization I didn't get 100% on) because I didn't have time to implement much of what I had to figure out by 'hard-knocks'"
7284,The best course of paleontology and paelobiolgy. Thanks!
7285,i found this course good for complete beginners.
7286,I love it!
7287,"Some of the material was not useful in completing the assignment. Profiting was not useful in this regard. While it is useful in the real world, it was unrelated to the assignment. Also, Letter examples of functions like apply, apply etc. besides using random data would be more likely to make sense what the function is doing. Also, there are references to statistics/statistical methods that the student may have no background in. His is also not helpful for explaining the material. The video content is largely just reading the text of the sides. It takes much more time to watch the reading of the sides than just to read them. His is not the best use of video. Either is watching the instructor sitting in his office talking. It would be better to see a concrete problem solved, and explain why the steps taken are used. The problem could be related to the assignment but different enough to not be copied. I had to rely heavily on online resources and help files to get answers to things I think should have been part of the course material, as this is an introductory class."
7288,"I learnt the different forms of sentences, differences between tense and sentence varieties. Thank you for this course."
7289,I JUST LIKE THIS COURSE of MUCH.............
7290,"its really very helpful for me as a beginner. After learning the video, I kind of know what's going on when I got the training of TEM. Thanks a lot for the free video."
7291,Gets from easier basis to harder ideas very fast. He gutta work very hard. But well worth it.
7292,Very easy class with a lot of fun.
7293,A real eye opened ... organized in a way that will get you into the subject without the fear of simplicity .... highly recommended
7294,It was a great experience.
7295,"Great introductory course to patron. Recent novice-level video but great assignment quality. Definitely takes up more time than expected, especially if you aren't well-versed with patron santa."
7296,His is a great course. It help me a lot.
7297,Good introduction to Python. Maybe include Sinus in the Install section.
7298,Clear and well-designed class
7299,"His was an excellent course, and gives a lot of insight and technique to develop a good and intriguing story. That I liked the most was how the story would be implements with the gameplay. I recommend this course to anyone that doesn't know how exactly to develop a good story, or is starting with of design."
7300,Very good course! It can be easily learned by many new hands and help them to handle most
7301,Enjoyed the course and learned a lot within short three weeks. Assignment that are peer-reviewed really help with learning and seeing different ways to tickling same problems.
7302,"Brilliant teachers sharing really useful insight about the learning process and how to optimism it. Highly recommended, tremendous resourceful."
7303,"it was good, could be more dynamic though"
7304,"Is a beginner, I found this course helpful. The approach of teaching is quite good, I also like the assignment which is often the part of a complete and meaningful program. But, I think clotting in patron is missed in this course, which is equally important to other sub-course"
7305,"It was great to learn about Unity with step-by-step instruction. I think a little more code explanation would have been nice at the end (Like what an ""!"" meant before something...I figured it out, but it pulled me out of the lesson to have to look things up or wonder about them.) Very interesting stuff."
7306,"His was a bit challenging, not in content, but more in organization. I felt like I was getting frenchman-level lectures and than was given a graduate-level assignment. The directions and expectations could have been clearer but the of was terrific in trying to help us thou our difficulties."
7307,His course opened my eyes on how valuable and structures information can be extracted from large datasets.In this course I learned:-That kind of problems can be solved with machine learning.-That kind of data is useful and how to get and prepare this data (+ Active/Atlas implementation).-Now machine learning algorithms work and how to implement them. And how to tune the parameter of the specific algorithm (+ Active/Atlas implementation).-Now to use different heuristics to evaluate the machine learning algorithms (+ Active/Atlas implementation).-Now to debut and optimism a machine learning system time efficiently (+ Active/Atlas implementation)..
7308,His is really an amazing opportunity to learn more and vast.
7309,not enough practical examples. the information is provided on a bit higher level
7310,Well-written exercises that really force you to get it. Plus you get a 6-month license so you can keep playing around with Tableaux once you've finished the course.
7311,Excellent course and teachers!!
7312,"Interesting statistical concepts, and great theory. However, the lectures and the quires do not prepare the student well for the final project."
7313,"Is a teacher, I found this course to be most helpful. Especially because as I got the to section on co-morbidities, one of my own students was diagnosed with Discalculia and had I not been doing this course I would have had a very limited understanding with which to guide the child's parents, as well as assist the child herself."
7314,I am on week 2 and loving it! :)Andrew's video are detailed and course material is very suppurative.
7315,I gave four stars for the reviews course of the specialization but I have to tell that week 2 and 3 of this course are outstanding. Teachers are really putting students in the right direction.
7316,I denotes the course thoroughly. It was a pleasure to listen to the professor. He instilled a sense of joy in understanding the classical sociological theories. I feel happy that I was exposed to the ideas of some of the greatest thinkers of Western Europe. I look forward to the next course on modern sociological theories.
7317,The instructor are rightly just calm enough to teach student as good as they could. Happy to be in this course! :)
7318,Great course.
7319,His is a critical skill and it's barely covered anywhere else. Thanks for making this course!
7320,"very information and challenging course, i enjoyed finishing it."
7321,Interesting course but the lectures are lacking in information. I would recommend as long as you don't mind a
7322,"Really great introduction course, which give you good basic understanding of software product management. By recommendations!"
7323,"great course, i learned a lot from you thanks"
7324,Material of the course organized well and easily grasped. Suites well for beginners. Experienced programme can watch the video very quickly and get introduced with basic rules of the script.
7325,"The only content I had access to were lectures, but I still want to say that I really liked this course. And I'm looking forward to another courses of this specialization.I'm a music student with bachelor's degree in Computer Science and dozens of course certificates (from the times they were free), I'm curious about everything.I used to say that I'll learn to paint when I retire :) But it turned out that I can do pretty good photo without having to wait until retirement. It's not the same thing, of course, but it's a visual art.His course and ""Camera, Exposure, and Photography"" reached me a lot and brought so much joy into my life.I'm not planning to make money as a photographer, but I'm happy to have an opportunity to create better and better photographs.Thank you, Prof. Glendinning and Prof. Sullivan. And thanks to everyone who helped to create this course.By photo can be found here, in case you're curious: http://www.flick.com/photo/140271759@N03/Most of them are made with my old cheap digital camera, only a few with a new DSLR. I would never have the courage and motivation to buy it without your courses. Thanks again for all the happiness photography brings into my life :)"
7326,Well presented content.It was a little bit weird for me to jump straight to jury and spending so little time on Javascript but it works out for the course. I would suggest a couple of more examples and explanation of general programming concepts with providing relevant of.Generally a very good and content-rich course.
7327,His is a great course for leading the development team but it's very theoretical.It is better to add video from real-world meetings.
7328,only just started this course but already enjoying it very much
7329,"Course lectures are good, but many quit questions are out of syllabus. Sorry, I am not satisfied."
7330,Too theoretical.
7331,"Caught by leading practitioner, the course presents realities that often buyers must be aware before embracing on the Loud . In the next revision Authors could consider condensing the last two weeks content, which are genetic in nature."
7332,Great course and great narration. Too many dates & history to keep in mind in such a short duration hata! But great stuff! Very helpful to improve your music industry knowledge beyond what your circle thinks.
7333,I LOVED taking this course! I've learned so much! I can't wait to take the additional courses available on this subject!
7334,Or. Utter de Graf is a great professor of communication science :)
7335,it's too basic for my taste.
7336,Challenge but very worthwhile to focus on what creates a good learning environment.
7337,"I haven't finished the course yet, but I liked it so much that I convinced my husband and my mon to knoll in it as well. The content of this course is so important that I honestly think it should be a mandatory class for everyone who is genuinely interested in learning, which could be a teenager on High School or an adult starting college. Finding this course feels like finding a treasure, thanks for creating such an amazing course and making it available on Coursera to the general public!"
7338,"Excellent, great fun, Jonathan Bliss is a top teacher, thanks !!!!!"
7339,"In extremely helpful and information course, with very detailed and well-structures content."
7340,His course assumes that you are familiar with freeRTOS.
7341,His course is somewhat lacking depth. The introduced tools are very basic and I would have expected more content for the prize
7342,Well organize course !
7343,Amazing course! I highly recommend it !
7344,A great course!
7345,"It is really a useful course. Great interviews, Arabic subtle.Thanks a lot."
7346,Very nicely created course. Enjoying it :)
7347,I never realized that programming will be so fun!. I start the course just for curiosity and now I'm completely hook in programming.
7348,Good course
7349,Fantastic Course
7350,I really enjoyed the course but would have learned more from concrete examples or case studies on the boarding pro
7351,Awesome Course..Easy to Understand and Professor Andrew G Made this course fun as well
7352,"Excellent Course! It would be awesome to have more advanced topics covered in future courses if it's ever in your plans. i.e. Lateral Torsional Suckling, Train Energy, Fatigue, Composite Material Failure Theories, Anisotropic Materials, Local tresses due to bolts, bolt groups, etc. You are the man!"
7353,Great entry level course! Fig thanks to Michael Worthington!
7354,"It is very well structures, easy to watch&listen course. Highly recommended!"
7355,Very interesting course. History of Macroeconomics is a little bit boring. I forgot it immediately after exam.But everything else is very good!
7356,Interesting course and very good teacher.
7357,"amazing course.Thank you.Now I each time I want to remember any of the approaches, I will remember the video attached to it and quickly remember the main features of each approach. His was quite challenging to me over the years. Thank you for making it possible."
7358,His course is very objective and accomplish the basic objectives of anyone that need a better understanding/revision of concepts about software processes and good practices
7359,"I wanted to give only 4 stars because of the all the “problems” we encountered, but then we are earners investigation problem solving by design thinking. He can handle whatever comes, so the fifth star is for us. He are shaping this course by contributing to forms. Presumably we are ten thousand strong, let’s improve our worldwide voice by saying something on forms so we can get what we need and want we want also to stay on the cutting edge of reality."
7360,Very information and a good course
7361,gives a very good introduction to the field. It was quite hard on the baths some times.
7362,"Unexpectedly rich in information, and of the same standard as an introductory university module"
7363,"His was an excellent course for understanding the fundamentals of many supervised and supervised learning algorithms. The topics were well chosen, the programming exercises and quires were appropriately difficult, and the video lectures were interesting. Moreover, I appreciated the more practical aspects of developing learning algorithms (e.g., what steps should you complete to assess if you even need to collect more data?). All in all, I'd highly recommend this course."
7364,"Entering this course with a pretty in-depth knowledge of Expel, it was good to be able to brush up on some things I don't use on a day-to-day basis such as VLOOKUP and STANDARDIZE functions. The subject material is quite good, AOC and Binary Classification were very interesting to learn about and have tons of applications, particularly in operation optimization problems/cases. One point of suggestion would be to double-check and clean up the accompanying Expel files. Some of the material was confusing to follow along with. Of you could define cells, array, and tables for instance it would make the material much more intuition to follow-along with."
7365,"It is worthwhile to spend your time and energy on this course if you're interested in this field. Prof. G has prepared many materials, including application cases in Silicon Valley, to illustrate the essence of machine learning. During the lectures, he was stick to the basic optimization concept, to minimize the cost function under constraint, which could answer many theoretical questions posed by beginners."
7366,"Good lessons, interesting content. But media is a bit old fashioned, I missed more interactive activities and more modern video."
7367,"Badly, there only english subtitles in the first video, so I can´t continue the course"
7368,is very useful course .
7369,Very interesting and pleasant course. I recommend it.
7370,There is the course study material and are you providing a book on this subject and Expel? You have me lost.
7371,Excellent course. Great learning. Top Notch facility. Definitely recommended for somebody who want to learn Strategy Management in detail.
7372,Awesome course. The instructor is perfectly clear and understandable. The assignment are very well-document and the code examples are awesomely laid!
7373,"It's a extended introductory course. Very useful to first understanding about war, history and sociological issues related."
7374,West of the lot so far for me. Such more reliable to my area of work. Round it a great addition to building on the previous
7375,The instructor explains grammatical concepts clearly with a very simple way.
7376,Awesome course :-) Thanks!
7377,Vice into to states and R.
7378,It's free and would serve many to be passed through at least 10-20 mind per few days. Good into.
7379,Great course to start with if you want to understand the principles of programming!
7380,His course was information and helped me to review my essay writing skill.
7381,"requires too much self-learning,could be overwhelming to those who lack concrete patron basis"
7382,"His is one hell of a courseThis is basically a good introduction to each and every basic of technique, what makes this distinct from the other courses is that, you really get your hands dirty with writing code on Python, which is really an industry relevant language for Data Sciences and MLThe theory is also, taken in detail and the assignment are cleverly designed, this course was a joy to take. Initially, I thought that I would complete this course in a span of 6 weeks, which is actually prescribed. But, the fluidity of the course content was so great, ended up completing the course within a weekDefinitely, taking the advanced courses"
7383,Maybe I missed the pre-requisite - I was unable to complete some of the questions correctly because I did not see any examples of how to answer the questions calling for calculations of formula.
7384,"Very useful course, which gave me the basic information about the subject."
7385,The course is very detailed and I like the way the instructor explain the material in an in depth way. I am learning a lot.
7386,His course is only useful if you have no experience visualizing data.
7387,Good introduction with practice.Unfortunately no certificate of accomplishment is available. His makes the Coursera platform less interesting.
7388,Fundamental concepts explained very well. I found it really useful.
7389,"Very objective, theoretical and empirical point of view of terrorist. Very clear explanations and very interesting lectures added about the subject. Very recommendable"
7390,I have learned so much in the course. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn HTML.
7391,"I general a good course, but some of the instructor were better than other"
7392,Incredible course! The instructor is so gifted in explaining! I understood the concepts I really needed for my graduate research from completely unrelated field. Any thanks to Professor G and his team for doing such a great job on this.
7393,It is an introductory course which will help you get started!!
7394,"There are serious issues with the quires. Other than trading correct/incorrect, there is no feedback afterwards."
7395,very interesting
7396,"Excellent tutor, excellent contents in notes. In one word ""Outstanding"""
7397,"I learned so much, and will use this knowledge gratefully in every day life. Thank you!"
7398,thanks! I feel better when I realize I do not want to learning new things. Now I can deal with my procrastinator and learn new things efficiently
7399,Great course
7400,"I found difficult to navigable within the course and the style of the course is not very modern. I felt difficult to follow the whole program, which might be also linked to my level of English that might not have been good enough, considering the technical vocabulary used in the program. However some interesting and very concrete tips to learn"
7401,"Excellent, great into. Moved it."
7402,"It's a good course for everybody who have interest in Python, you don't need to be familiar with any programming language, even a primary school graduate can easily follow the course. I believe this course is truly practicing the original purpose of course."
7403,Well Structures course especially for beginners.Professor is quite majestic with his nature of interaction.Moved it !!!
7404,Good for the green hand.
7405,"I liked most everything about this course, even if it stretches one to understand / pronounce the biological terms. Still it is better to have a little more of the scientific component than too less. The video were very well done, good to have the sub-titles because sometimes with Mob it was had to follow so it was nice to read too.The extra material and reference were also well appreciated. In fact we would be very interested to follow-up if/when more results of the project are known. Lint - write another book!"
7406,It was simply awesome the way strategy was simplifies into the course...Thank you for awesome work
7407,His is very clear and explains to everyone understanding the workings of patron.
7408,"Badly, I found the presentation poor: not at all client, and under-prepared - sometimes what was said was different from what was written (which was correct), potentially causing confusion. Also, some results were given without justifying them, for instance the concept of simplest number was stated but not proper"
7409,Very good course!
7410,Good explanation for beginner.
7411,His course helps me a lot about how to learn science. Indeed it gives me confidence to believe that I could acquire complex knowledge if I want! Such appreciate for providing me this course!
7412,Very good introductory course. Looking forward to the rest of the data engineering courses.
7413,Very interesting course
7414,"A bit dry, but so very interesting. Thank you very much for the course. I loved the Course Pal Lech."
7415,great course. learn a lot. thanks
7416,Pretty basic but good
7417,"Information is provided in clear form, lecture are easy to follow. Would like to learn more information about events (had some problem with assignment) and have more freedom on last assignment (another database, purpose of the webster)"
7418,"Great course, very well explained and useful exercises"
7419,I like the humor of the professor although I can not understand what that means.
7420,Life changing!
7421,Easy to understand and very interesting professor!
7422,"Exceptional, useful, top quality knowledge!"
7423,"good, can we have mind project as well, so that we have more hands-on to R?"
7424,His course does a great job introducing terms of embedded systems and of. Although the week 4 about internet protocol needs more lessons and lectures to get clear ideas before the final work.
7425,Great content for states!! Sides are easy to follow. Lectures are never boring mainly due to the witty professor!! Love this course!!
7426,Great course!! I've really enjoyed it!
7427,Vice Sides.Vice Us.Vice Content.
7428,"Another well thought module by the same great professors of University of Geneva. Cannot tell you how much we enjoy your course so far and how useful all these knowledge is for us, students. Such appreciated!"
7429,"Very instructive, engaging and challenging."
7430,"Vice course, instructor is so pretty :p and gives all detail. But those who are weak in English , may face problem to follow. Never the less, good course from one of the best B-School in the world.(of ranks 12 in Global MBA banking by of)"
7431,North taking
7432,West beginning course for Machine Learning. Thanks Andrew
7433,"Simple to use, great information with both academic and real-life examples to reference."
7434,"all steps are given so easy to understand with important details to apply is so good, do not miss!"
7435,Not great content. Helps in pricking-decision-making analytical as well. Very good examples and stimulation. Enjoyed the course. Totally worth it.
7436,It is very good course material for Park with scala.
7437,"more interaction and going assignment would be better, but really great course!"
7438,It's an inspiring lecture for those who have little background about game theory.
7439,"Basic course, great for states, I need something else"
7440,"You can find your object in this course, but this course is too latitude to make me feel boring..."
7441,"Excellent class, well-designed programming exercises with autograding."
7442,"That I learned in this course is very useful and helpful, thanks to professor Valley, professor Sejnowski and all those who have contributed to this course!"
7443,"I took the Medical Neuroscience course as a way of getting a broad overview of the subject, and was not disappointed. The course starts with a solid basis in neuroanatomy, and build in concepts and topics in a well structures way. The course seems to pursue two goals - on the one hand, to provide the basic neuroanatomy, physiology and functional background, and on the other to apply the knowledge to understand, identify and localise some medical conditions such as stroke, motor neuron disease, or Atkinson's Disease. The lab sessions and tutorials are entertaining and information, thanks to Or. White's friendly and engaging presentation style. The tutorials are accompanied by useful notes, and the frequent quires support the learning of the very extensive material. His recommendations for learning the material (follow the path, visualized your knowledge, learn specially and socially) are useful in many other contents. The materials are supported by a reference textbook, Neuroscience th edition from 2012, and a new edition is expected in 2017. Also, the text transcription of the video presentations appear to have been generate by machine, and need to be proofread and corrected. In spite of this, they are very useful to review specific points in the video. Although the course presents a huge amount of material and the discussion forms allow both clarification of issues and questions as well as deepening and extending the knowledge provided by the basic materials in the course. I strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a basic overview of human neuroscience."
7444,thanks for providing me knowledge about such cool stuff.
7445,"Data Structures was really interesting, over all, also assignment are quite challenging. It's important to check the external references & discussion forms if you want to get the best of it."
7446,"I beta-tested this course and it was an amazing experience. The instructor are super engaging and beat, despite having to delivery a very complex subject like Bayesian statistics. The quires are very rich, with a nice balance of practice quires and grade quires. The practice quires offer very helpful explanations that can help to reinforce understanding before doing the grade quit. Last but not least, the final project description is super exciting and thorough. I highly look forward to completing this course and get a deep introduction to Bayesian statistics."
7447,thank you very much
7448,"Great, educational course with clear instructions, well written material. You learn a lot in a very short time!"
7449,"Great course, they feed us in small morsels, and you can stop the video and write some code yourself."
7450,I think it is amazing! Met me know a lot of principles in the genetic data analysis.
7451,"Very good introduction and advanced insight in the field at the same time. A performance to get to the essential without getting entangled with the baths, while you will need at least a little understanding of algebra."
7452,"it was a great course. Or. Chuck, knows how to teach quality material to the masses. i would only suggest that on the programming assignment, it would be best if the instructor doesn't write half of the code. one reason is that having some of the code written would make that student think that the piece of code provided must be a part of the whole code. and as i worked on the programming assignment i realized that much of the code provided wasn't needed, in fact it took me longer than necessary to solve the assignment because i kept using the code provided, and upon solving the assignment none of the code that was provided was a part of the code i wrote. ....on to the next course. Data Structure.thank you course and of."
7453,Awesome course and a must do for not only students but also for all life long earners...
7454,"A great course! His course provides a comprehensive coverage of different learning technique, as well as different theory behind 'learning how to learn.' The instructor are enthusiastic, and provide many different background to learning -- the neurological, biological, and psychological aspects of learning are are covered. A good course to compete for anyone who wants to improve their ability to learn new things and think clinically."
7455,Learning a lot!
7456,One of the most useful course on of Management!
7457,"Him does an excellent job explaining things at depth and at the same time keeping things interesting. The quires and programming assignment are well thought and carefully balanced vs the material taught. They force you to stretch just a bit beyond the lectures, which is a good thing IMHO.And there is a wealth of advanced/optional material for the curious."
7458,"Very good and quick course, which gives you some hints on what you can improve in your approach to studying. It's a valuable resource of learning advice and mechanism which allow your mind to learn. It's a great subject to study not only as a fundamental for other studies, but also on its own."
7459,"Taking this course has changed my outlook towards life and the world. Earlier, I used to blame everything for any problems that I faced, but now I've started to count my blessings for thousands of small happy things happening in my life."
7460,"A whole lot of information to absorb, that I will definitely agree with! Of there was anything I wish went into more detail, there would be two things.1) To / Yeoman: His part of the course was more of an ""Obligatory"" lecture, just to say it's mentioned. I watched that one video many times over, but still ended up going to YouTube for actual ""training"" on the in and out. I know time is constrained in MOOC's and you don't get the full load of knowledge you would in a traditional school. However, my thoughts are that either give us an exercise so we can at least have that as experience in using it, or just remove it completely. The lecture was put together as a sort of ""Follow Long"", but it really felt rushed and more of an ""Obligatory"" thing than an actual lesson.2) Give us more detail on the difference between Services and Factories. Deep in mind that I still have Multi-Platform Mobile Pp Development, and Server Side Development with Rode.is still to go, so I don't know if these are explained more in those courses. Is it stands right now, I -still- don't know the difference between a factory and a service, or even what a provider is. When should I use a factory? When should I use a service? Which is better suited for what task? All those questions I do not have an answer for after this course, which feels a bit short for me."
7461,Great!
7462,"Excellent course! Very well taught. Or Gregory Northcraft is very well spoken and engaging. His course is nicely structures with Headings, Sides, Cases, Essays, and Quizzes. About 6 hours per week for 4 weeks. Nicely paced. I did not take this with the for credit iMBA classes, but am considering doing so and might thus repeat these courses to take the iMBA classes. I like that you can get certificates and a Specialization in the Leadership and can even grow this into the iMBA which is a fully accredited world class MBA program from the University of Illinois at Urban-Campaign. I highly recommend this course!"
7463,"His was a wonderful course, I would definitely take this again."
7464,His is just what it says it is...an into to guitar. Enjoy!
7465,"Funny and entertaining, besides vigorous. It gives an intuition understanding of all the formula and a clear big picture of what calculus is all about."
7466,"Homework is very helpful. Theory very clear, and complimentary materials are useful and helpful community! Awesome"
7467,Excellently put together.Little trouble with the Atlas licensing duration though.
7468,"Sides proceed way too fast for complete beginners and things are explained without enough underlying basis. Plus there is not really enough chance for repetition in the video. Local explanations are good, except for the green line where you are not told how to choose what part of that tone to pronounce every time. Overall, it could be a great course but falls short because the video proceed way too fast and without enough repetition or even practice exercises to be able to remember the phrases afterwards."
7469,"Excellent content, well represented.It's been so long since something engaged my mind so much.Thanks every body and congratulation to such success."
7470,"Fool stuff along with fascinating teaching. Teacher's energetic manner deeply absorb learner.Thanks a lot cause of this in my view ""masterpiece""."
7471,Amazing concepts and very interesting course
7472,this course is the best
7473,Really useful course. I would highly recommend it to any person interested in beginning with Software security. Some of basic skill are needed to follow the course and take profit of the lessons.
7474,"Really good theoretical introduction but couldn't do some of the tasks because my patron skill weren't up to scratch, however the course says you don't need any previous patron knowledge, so I disagree with that. However, overall a really good introduction."
7475,"Machine learning is the best online module I've taken so far. Professor G makes those technical concepts visible us in a very understandable way, and the course assignment are at just right difficulty.I'm quite inspired by the content of machine learning and want to pursue a future career in this area. It would so great if some higher level courses come next, with focus on the application of machine learning algorithms."
7476,"A very intuition course! All the necessary information I needed to know about corporate finance was given to me, easily and successfully! I have completed my gaps in the knowledge of the WACC and the EVA which was a rather complicated factor. I look forward to knoll in more courses with professor Strata! Thank you very much!"
7477,"I loved, learned and understood a lot. Opened my eyes in reference to many issues that caused me concern, thank you."
7478,Learning never should be assumed by the source. Online sources too can outside other platforms. His course is doing wonders to me and is definitely making me a better writer.
7479,"Lectures are easy to follow, but the homework was a little too easy."
7480,I like it when courses are related to real life problems and thus immediately useful. And that's the case with this course. You'll not only learn some interesting ways to model things out. It will make you tick and reflect on a lot of subjects / putting things into perspective. Long but rewarding!
7481,AMAZING view of business!
7482,I enjoyed this course. It was well thought out and nicely put together.
7483,"Great material, great methodology and lots of knowledge to apply in a communicates daily work."
7484,Amazing course
7485,Great into to method! The professor has great energy and enthusiasm.
7486,"His was a great course, and Or. Chuck's education to teaching Python is amazing. I went through the ""Programming for Everybody (Python)"" course and as stated in the description, this course is equivalent to the second half of the first course. I missed that detail and would have otherwise just skipped right to the third course (Using Python to Access Web Data."" Otherwise, it's a great course."
7487,"Is so cool to me, the opportunity and is very terrific the applications...Very Good!"
7488,His course is a good way to start anyone on learning more about how to help others in distress. You don't need to be a trained clinical or mental health expert to learn about psychological first aid. I think it would benefit communities tremendous if more people can learn about PFA.
7489,"Very interesting for beginners. Is very hands on focus, not much theory and is focus on the most used commands, leaving the deep knowledge for other courses."
7490,"The course is excellent in many ways. The course material,video is very simple and understandable to a layman also. one need not be an expert.The presentation was superb, leaving no doubt at the end of each week.The course material and video is self sufficient. I am very happy to have joined the course. I would like to complete the rest of the course satisfactorily. I would love to have soft copies of the material which can be download for study at convenient. Thank you"
7491,Very good overview course for CPU micro architecture.
7492,The course is good only for those people who have only started thinking about launching their first business
7493,Great lessons!! Great Professors!!
7494,"I have just finished the course. The course professor has used real life cases to link up with the course material which helps students to connect well with the concepts being used. Very useful for those who are getting into project management but have not done any specific mortification around project management.In fact, I would recommend this course to all those getting into jobs as a bit of project management does impact all of us even if we are not driving any project. Knowledge about project management basis will enable us to contribute better towards successful completion of projects."
7495,"Although a little corn, the way this course is designed with skits really helps me sink in content."
7496,"great class, easy to follow"
7497,"Excellent course, the professor makes it very understandable and enjoyable. It could look as a shallow introduction but it's not, it goes deep enough into the topics so you can move forward in any direction of the machine learning."
7498,"Great course indeed, can recommend it to anyone interested in mobile development"
7499,"Very thorough and clear. I am from psychology background and I was expecting to have a lot of difficulty in understanding it, however I found the course really helpful. Even the baths and physics portions were only slightly difficult."
7500,a very information course that gives you a good understanding of the complexities regarding an ever changing planet!! I enjoyed it.
7501,best instructor ever
7502,"Great material, very interesting courses, I would highly recommend this course to anyone!"
7503,I loved the class. especially the real world example.
7504,Great course
7505,"Very Interesting so far, great professors"
7506,Excellent course !!! I highly recommend it !! ;)
7507,"very cool lecture,learned quite a lot of of and practices in business environment"
7508,"Of your goal is to just get a certificate to put on your resume, this specialization will check the box. The assignment are poorly thought out, overlay rigid for requiring very specific methods and medium, and the peer review system is kind of a joke. Of you're sincerely interested in learning IXD and creating a high quality portfolio piece, this course is moderately helpful toward that end, but you'll need to supplement it with lots of outside reading and in person coursework to really get where you want to be. Of you're weighing whether to attend an in-person course or program or go with this specialization to save some $, just know that you'll get what you pay for."
7509,"His is the third of 5 courses in Python 2.7, so the full 5 courses are excellent for a Beginner to become a solid Intermediate, this Web Access course alone should only be taken by those with some Python programming experience (like the prior 2 beginning courses on programming and data structures in Python). I did the course using Python 3.5, from Anaconda, after starting the more challenging MIT 6.00 courses (2 of them), which use 3.5 but are faster paced yet with more challenging problems. [Some issues twitching from 2.7 to 3.5 -- there now is a revised Open Source book using pox] Or. Chuck's course offers true high quality learning but allowing me to work my 40 his /week and do the course, also it took me two sessions to finish. Now fully completed after twitching to the next later session. NOTE - these MOOCs allow one to switch to the next session when one falls behind; this is better for getting of help in the forms when there is a problem. Thanks!(above is same as Glass Central, below is new)Now could it be improved? By having for each required assignment a similar but more difficult optional assignment, which can be further discussed in the forms. I'd expect that twitching auto-grade assignment & sample code to be by.5, especially the print() change, would be fairly easy and allow students to choose which version to do the assignment it."
7510,"Its been very helpful, Thank you."
7511,"To far this course is given at a pace that is just perfect. The instructor explain concepts in ways that make the subject matter easy to learn, particularly for someone who loves data, but is terrified of heavy mathematical concepts. I've taken similar courses at local community colleges where class size is much smaller, and have been very disappointed. To f"
7512,Excellent course. Thoroughly enjoyed the work.
7513,Really helpful course on environmental laws.
7514,I enjoyed the time spent on the specialization and felt that the lesson exercises provided some use towards helping students develop their understanding of the craft. By only real criticism about the specialization is that I feel the curriculum could be a little more intensive. Keeping most assignment limited to a 500 word maximum is very constricting. I wish there were more metier assignment to tackle building up to the capstone.
7515,It was my first glimpse inside the strange world of making money by being patient. Pushing takes us nowhere. Thank you.
7516,Hated the course and the content. I truly regret investing my money on this course.
7517,"His course is a perfect tutoring for novice of machine learning. But the amount of knowledge is still far fromenough for further advancement. Prof. G reaches very well, I am desperately looking forward to his new courses on advance machine learning. PLEASE put out more advance courses on machine learning!"
7518,awesome course I learned a great
7519,His was a great course. I understood how important listening is in Communication.
7520,I wish the last week were more explanatory. Although overall now I do have an idea. It's a good course. :-)
7521,"I am getting into depth of leadership, actually i was in fear of knowing leadership qualities. I thought do i might able to understand correctly what is leadership, are those qualities are in me! And i realize that yes i have those certain things and i can develop. Thanks for offering such course."
7522,Extremely interesting. I am glad Duke University offers this course via Coursera.
7523,excellent introduction courses for beginners
7524,great course!thank you Barbara and Terence for an outstanding material
7525,"Content was great and Prof. Miller is one of the most important economists of his generation. However, the assessment could have been better structures so as to be more challenging and a better diagnostic tool for earners. See the Phaeton School Introduction to Corporate Accounting course for an example of well implements multiple choice exam."
7526,"Excellent course, with nice companion book, thoroughly created self-examination, and incredibly persuasion lecturer. Highly recommend!"
7527,"Excellent course. Was very thorough, entertaining and interesting."
7528,Some disconnected between assignment and lectures but you'll find that in a lot of classroom settings. Otherwise fantastic content about the basis of R Programming and the environment thereof.
7529,"The course is challenging, but the professor is really awesome."
7530,Really helpful course for beginner writers - and particularly those looking to write for our youngest readers.
7531,Concise. A good tool to learn in few minutes.
7532,Fantastic course. Thank you!
7533,Very helpful to me. Thanks GIT and to you sir.
7534,to much path
7535,it was quite mind opening to me. as it help me to relate calculus from note to reality and vice versa
7536,Great course with directions from Andrew about what to start with in Machine learning.A more comprehensive course with pattern recognition in general could however be devised.
7537,The professor makes it very easy to understand.
7538,good course. kickstarted me with patron and datascience
7539,"Excellent Course, I learned a lot."
7540,very well structures and enjoyable course! love it!
7541,"I found the course pretty basic. It did cover the topics well , however, in-depth understanding and newer concepts (for eg. exercises on time quarante) could have been introduced & explained in detail."
7542,"Great curses. Very day I learn through rates for myself a lot. The information I get , motivate me and makes us believe in yourself and your success. Thank you."
7543,Disorganized course materials. Caps in the materials.
7544,His course is a good starting point for learning the bits and pieces of R. It shows you how to work with data in a fairly easy manner.The course is well explained and the exercises are challenging.
7545,"Great tips. Well paced video that were easy to get through or make time listen to. In quires along the way to test that the information was being received.Well planned, excellent and very helpful. Thank you for the Pomodoro technique!"
7546,His course was fantastic. A glimpse of how good quality education could be brought to the millions of people around the world who otherwise would be capable but were not lucky enough to be born in the right place and/or with enough resources to afford world class education.
7547,When I started this course I was a beginner in WebDev. After this course I feel that the tools and skill I had the opportunity to get familiarized here gave my the necessary guideline to pursue a more advance level. Give stars!
7548,"Should have talked about how German and other European industries used forced labour for their benefit. Niemen is still involved in lawsuit about this and is on the news now.Please also talk about IBM's involvement in helping Gaze's with punch cards to help organise the millions of jews and other races they murderedArt theft is something that really interesting that was not touched upon. the german got is now providing subsidies to art owners who wish to examine the provenance of the art they own so that it can be returned to the heirs of the rightful ownersInvolvement of Swiss (while being neutral) in banking and financial support to Paris and exploitation of News is something that missing here. Numbered accounts were created to help jews send their money abroad without being detected, but their heirs could never get the money back"
7549,"It's not a university standard course. It's more like introduction to introduction DIY Swift. The video are chronic and lack applications, examples, exercises and practical assignment. Such better into to Swift can be found on many couture channels or just on swift documentation webster."
7550,"Another fine course from Professor Stein. I particularly appreciated the final set of lectures, but all were well presented, understandable, and relevant."
7551,"Its a lot useful for people who want to learn how the development of games is done from the scratch. New basic details are not concentrated well, but overall the course is very valuable."
7552,I loved this course. I was afraid of proofs and now feel confident in writing my own.
7553,His course is very useful and attractive! It help me to sharp a healthy lifestyle and lead a happy family life
7554,"Personally, I feel that the way of sharing and teaching was assuming everyone is an expert in this subject. His course need to be reviewed to make it more suitable to various groups of profession as not everyone has the same level of mathematics background."
7555,"It has been a wonderful experience in my life! Thank you, dear teachers."
7556,"Love the lectures and the way everything is organized in the course, however the information or instructions provided by the laws seem incomplete."
7557,great course thank you!!!!!!
7558,Any New things are available to learn. I am already a management student but this course help to know me that i dont know anything and I am continuously learning many new concept.
7559,"Absolutely outstanding. The course is well-paced, relevant, and engaging. I will be recommending this course to several of my colleagues."
7560,"Concepts are interesting, the assignment are not. Writing and re-writing about the teacher's genetic game example. Not much opportunity to work on your own content."
7561,I think this course is a good start for the person who never programme in Objective-C before!
7562,"Solid explanations of the basis of patron and hands. Strong emphasis on self-learning in assignment, which may be difficult for those without background in programming."
7563,"autograder will not accept my valid code that contains all valid elements, will not make the deadline so will not bother continuing."
7564,It is very simple course. It is perfect for nonprogrammers.
7565,clear content
7566,"His is a great course to start learning graphics design. Though I expected to find a bit more profound information, I still recommend it to those who has never had any experience (or conscious experience) designing something"
7567,"Very interesting topic and material (I especially liked the results presented from Psychology research)! The teaching is very good with good pacing and clear presentation of the material (I also liked Prof. Right's somewhat dry sense of humor, personally).The load is a bit demanding for a working person if you insist on doing all the extra reading and viewing the extra material (which I did anyway, because it was interesting and I am stubborn :) ) but it's only 6 weeks so you can pull through it, or just stay with the core.I got out of this course with many interesting ideas to think about, and with 2 books I from which I read some chapters that I would very much like to go on and read completely."
7568,Thank you very much! Very understandable and interesting!
7569,"Very good course. I learned the basis of data warehousing, design and data integration, and get abilities on Pentaho (a data integration tool)."
7570,It was a very good course. I enjoyed the learning experience very much.
7571,Was looking for something like this
7572,"Very interesting, as long as you do not undertake the course to become popular ! I learned a lot, but at the end of the course, I felt that the course was too much tormented on the problems that can arise for young people, especially if they are not popular. Good course anyway"
7573,"His course provides a nice insight into the gazing theory. To not expect to make a dive into video game analysis. His game focused on the fundamental ideas behind gazing, which includes all games. However, the assignment revolve around building board games, so you do not need to worry about not knowing any coming to make video games. Assignment criterion could use some polish, as the rubrics focus too much on mechanics (is it one page long?) rather than content elements. The delivery of the content is interesting. The instructor has gone to great lengths to bring in features that will help you focus better. There could be a better 100% integration between the material in the video and the assignment, as sometimes you are asked to use only a tiny portion of 30 minutes of video for the week, and that can make the video less useful, or the assignment not as educational."
7574,Great Course ...
7575,"Great course, very inspire"
7576,Simply to understand. Useful for my work.
7577,"His course is extremely information and comprehensive without overburdening the learner with vocabulary, dated theories and complex concepts. It reaches you through the examples of verified Change Makers who are successful today!! Thank you!!!!!"
7578,Awesome Course. The Instructor and his way of teaching is Amazing.
7579,Very interesting course if you want to learn about inner workings of distributed systems. Lecturer was very knowledgeable and provided good examples. Adams and quires were pretty challenging and fun. I love that there was a practical programming assignment. I would only suggest to weak the temple for programming assignment as it was a little bit limiting. And maybe allowing for different programming languages other than C++.
7580,Good course to get the fundamental learning....
7581,The greatest specialization on finance ever!!!Great courses by Gautam! I definitely recommend them to anyone wanting to learn more about finance.Gautam is fantastic! He makes finance understandable and fun. I love his courses and his way of teaching! He seems to love the subject matter and shows that he is interested and cares about delivering the material to the students so that they start appreciating it too. There should be more teachers like him. TOP course! TOP professor!!!
7582,A great course
7583,its excellent i recommend this
7584,The most existing and inspiring course! Thank you for interesting lessons and very helpful information!
7585,"Awesome course! I really liked the way Prof. Yakov Chaikin has structures the course, very information and very interactive. Thanks to Prof. Yakov. I would definitely recommend this course."
7586,Intense and very nicely explained difficult concepts.
7587,Very information and useful course on R programming for beginners like me.
7588,Overall a good introduction to the current state of global energy supply and demand. It covers basic information about the controversy of nuclear vs renewables though personally I would have liked a little more detail on this point
7589,"It is a great course for introduction about identifying social entrepreneurship opportunities. They show you some organizations, what they do, how they were created and so on through interviews. They also provide links and interesting documents where you can get additional information. It is also good because you can interact with other students, their projects and ideas. I miss a few things like giving you tools and social business plans but I believe that they will come in the next courses."
7590,I found the course useful as an overview into the process of design thinking. The content was delivered in an engaging manner and the examples and case studies were memorable.
7591,"I felt that more time could have been spent going over the patron code in the last section. The code was made available, and it is up to the students to review the code at their own pace. His is good. It may further help to go over the code in the video lectures themselves."
7592,Overall I think the course was good. His course requires you to do a lot of self study and research on every single topic. It only covers the very basic and core topics. I would have liked it to have more hands on or practical examples.
7593,"His course was a positive surprise! Professor Are is a really good lecturer, you can feel his energy even if it's all recorded and the course is very well structures (and does not take too much time). I'm a dog lover and owner (I have 2 dogs), but I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in extending ones common knowledge, plus, it is a very interesting topic to bring up when networking as well as a conversations started!Thanks for an awesome course!"
7594,I really like how Or. Severance's way of teaching. His style is unrestricted funny. That's really makes me interest in learning programming. Thanks a lot. I really appreciate that!
7595,Great course. Only accessed the course via 'audit'. Really enjoyable.
7596,"In excellent experience, thanks.."
7597,Incredible course! It´s some to feel like taking classes inside the university again!
7598,His course is really useful for Firing and In boarding purpose
7599,Great course!!!
7600,"A refreshing course for me, helped me to revise the stuff done long ago"
7601,"Great Teacher, Great Feedback."
7602,"Some of the examples used and the assignment given were quite old dated that no longer exist. Also, some of them were region specific tasks. His is a global course site and hence course structure should be such that every region could easily access the information and can contribute well in the assignment."
7603,It's quite simple and doesn't show specific steps of how to do it.
7604,Gets a new benchmark for the specialization !!! A great offering on Machine Learning :)
7605,One of the best courses related withfinance and economy.
7606,Good analysis of MSW practices in developing countries
7607,His is a very good course; it help to remind the knowledge about the introduction at the Calculus I.
7608,"A bit easier if you know a bit about programming, pretty recommended if you know nothing."
7609,Thanks for bringing me into Machine Learning world
7610,A GREAT COURSE!Very useful. The present has absolutely a way with his way of teaching.Thank you!!
7611,Very inspiring and introduces me into the world of of. Thank you very much.
7612,"His is one of the most amazing courses I have ever taken!I immensely appreciate the amount of scientific rigor that the course projects on every lesson. All the material is very well prepared, and the way that it is structures had leaded me understand non-trivial concepts incrementally.I appreciate a lot the amount of effort behind this course. Thank you very much!"
7613,I find this course very interesting.
7614,Love it
7615,Very useful with practical advice
7616,Changed the way I thought about program design.
7617,"It's a real good course with a great base for know where and how start your own project, this course allows you to build basic Of and Of games, with a little more effort you can build amazing things."
7618,very helpful and entertaining!
7619,Not that detailed stuff.
7620,It's not an into class. But you can practice a lot if you know something.
7621,Informative course!
7622,Easily Understandable... VERY Interesting... Thoroughly Entertaining...
7623,The best of the courses in the specialization in my opinion.
7624,I really loved the course. It was easy to understand and provided useful concepts.
7625,"The course was challenging, and although I would have liked a bit more information from the video lectures, and a bit more practice on using the basic functions, I learned a lot.I thought the video lectures were a little spare. There were only 20-30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignment required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture video quite a bit.More examples in video lectures would have helped. I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignment just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture.To overall, the course was challenging and definitely a fair amount of work coming from someone new to patron (but moderately experienced in C programming), and although I would have liked a bit more guidance, I learned a lot."
7626,Very disappointed in this course. It is more of an infomercial for American But than an actual course. Additional knowledge gained was very little.
7627,Excellent course with a great and well learned lecturer. Very practical and theoretical balance. I've learnt a lot!
7628,Very helpful and the host is great! I learned so much and really enjoyed every bit of it!
7629,"It was my first course at course and hopefully not the last one! Any thanks for all of the makers, participants, professors, researches. I learned a lot of excellent technique, read, saw, heard a lot of great and inspiring stories. I think I've learned much from you guns!By best regards,Andrew Rákóczy"
7630,One of the best courses I have taken so far on Coursera. Great lecture content and excellent accompanying text (Open Into to Statistics). Highly recommended.
7631,His course is not designed well.
7632,easy to understand
7633,Easy to follow but the content has useful information. Lips can be applied since day one.
7634,Learned so much! excellent. Challenging tests and interesting lectures
7635,Vice course for practical knowledge of new marketing concepts / possibilities through the changing digital environment.
7636,"Great introduction, even I have not learned any course like this can also be good at this."
7637,Amazing course! Prof. Muppala makes it very very to understand the concepts. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to understand the ways of Rode.is/Express/MongoDB.
7638,amazing ideas in a simple way
7639,"I wouldn't never recommend this course. The teacher gives you all information without normal explain. You have change to understand HTML and CSS, but Is . of language need more details, examples and explaining, who I didn't find in this course. The first course is a basis for late courses and so weak teacher. I took the next series of course co I saw that there are other teacher"
7640,"The professor of this course expects you to read his mind too much, preferring to skin through explaining his reasoning for solving some problems, such as calculating risk with the Empirical rule. He also mentions subject in the course outlines which he is supposed to lecture about in the course but doesn't, or just expects you to learn it yourself."
7641,It is really a perfect course for a beginner and also for the experienced to learn the logic behind each topic. Thanks.
7642,Thank you! Super fun to learn and would recommend this course for anyone that want to learn Machine Learning.
7643,"He want some details in lecturings, thank you"
7644,Really interesting!
7645,I really like this course. I plan to take more courses in the sector offered by University of Albert.
7646,Great fundamental information of Hospitality.
7647,very good instructor.
7648,"Great class, easy to follow, and very information. One of my favorite, if not my favorite, course I have taken in Coursera."
7649,Brilliant!
7650,"The course has some valuable information, however course materials and video are not so helpful. Of you already have some knowledge about statistics and expel, it will be a lot easier to follow the instructor's lectures, otherwise I don't feel how a beginner could really follow up on this course. Some topics are run through so quickly that they are confusing to students."
7651,Excellent!! Thanks to Coursera and Professor Robert for provide light and knowledge. I really enjoy this course!! Thanks again...
7652,"The course is helpful for covering many aspects of project and product management, still it seems to be to basic which put in question whole specialization."
7653,Simple and direct. Must the way it should.
7654,"A must for every student and learner... so, for everyone!It gives not only useful advice and instructions, but also hopes and refreshed motivation."
7655,To the point. Precise. Concise. I would recommend it to anyone who want's to take a first course in Web Development.
7656,His was a great learning experience about nutrition food and explored various option to inculpate healthy eating in today's food intake.
7657,Clear and Step by Step Instruction! Want be more great!
7658,there are some fatal problems in its of system
7659,It's a great course site... I learn lot of new thing in this course.
7660,Great course! Congrats to the teacher!It was clear and I learnt a lot!
7661,Really appreciated!
7662,His course is really interesting! Something in weeks and weeks is relatively complex and we can explore more in this field later!
7663,I learnt a lot and was able to take the course at my own pace. It was really insightful doing the peer reviews as I learnt from my peers experiences as well.
7664,Really good.
7665,"His course is brilliant, full of insight and easy to start routine that make your life as a teacher so much easier and most of all brings back the fun part of being a teacher!All the skill I picked up during this course are helping me in my day to day life as a teacher and have helped me cut out some ""me time"" in my fast-peace life styleThank-you"
7666,To overlay simple with a lack of details in the steps.
7667,"Great, an interesting introduction to the quadrotors dynamic and control, so expected."
7668,A great short course delivered by one of the best agricultural economist in the world with a great publication history
7669,"Entertaining, baths the fun way."
7670,"One of the best courses online! very information, engaging , and useful"
7671,"Organization of the class is clear and easy to follow. However, it might be better to place the Supplementary Headings after the Essential Headings for each unit. It times I would miss these required reading on the outline. Other times I would think they were required reading for the coming unit, when in actually they were still part of the required reading for the previous unit. Most of the time, I come across the supplementary reading after the quit has been taken. And when you're following the steps on the webster the computer screen determines where you go once each step is completed. The quires at the end of each unit should be placed at the end of each unit. I appreciate the ability to take quires at least three times and that you use the same quit for each time it is retaken. Something I would change about the quires is, that the quires display the questions that were asked, instead of just marking with a green check mark or red X next to the number and the question that was asked, once the quit has been submitted. The video and transcripts of those video is very helpful. The video are very clear and easy to understand. The content of the supplementary reading at times went over my head, but the content is both helpful and useful information.The due dates for each assignment was reasonable and flexible. Side from including the questions asked for each quit after submission I would change your policy of establishing the honor code. When attempting to have my picture taken along with my of to establish identification my head didn't quite line up with the Head Frame displayed on my screen and the button needed to be pressed in order to take the picture. The button was either not visible or the head shot frame was too high up.I understand the need to establish ones identity during online classes, but wouldn't it be better to create a electronic pledge for the students to agree to? One that would uphold and honor the Coursera Honor Rode; When someone is asked to type the same sentence repeatedly they're tying speed can increase because of the familiarity of that sentence. Also, the need to take more than one photo of the student before a quit might make them feel uncomfortable. Especially, when the student is taking a quit later in the day and may not exactly be ""picture really""."
7672,Excellent Course and I highly recommended for those who want to have a professional career in Marketing. His course is open to anyone who wants to study International Marketing & Cross Industry Growth. I have a conviction the Marketing Analysis method in this course can be used by anyone to analyze Current Industries and Future Industries in any countries in the world.
7673,"impressive course, learnt a lot, thanks"
7674,Great course and professors.
7675,showing relation to physics
7676,"His is a great into to economics. It's a tireless subject that is explained very well by Professor Millard of of, Madrid. I would recommend this course to anyone."
7677,Detailed understanding provided to the concepts of effective Project Management.
7678,West course on of there is.
7679,"You did an outstanding job teaching this class. In another class, sometime I would like to understand things like salt and potassium and their importance. Good job!"
7680,Thank you!
7681,The course is very helpful for me.
7682,simple and niceloevd it
7683,I like all of the content and this course provide me to understand the management of a project. His was my first e-learning action and i loved this.
7684,I have enjoyed taking this Course. It's really useful and I learnt a lot.
7685,great course
7686,"Such a warm approach, creative, extremely useful. Thank you so much for the effort and for the course, including the extra materials and great references!"
7687,"Interesting subject & Basic idea to have a dog defined for the exercises is nice but w/o dog hard to benefit. A bit too much talking in front of a wall ;-) Would benefit from more illustration material. Wraps / Sides / Pictures. Why not show examples of Dogs doing the games, that would be great for people who do not (yet) own a dog. I was hoping to get some insight into problematical dog behaviour but maybe that was wrong expectation."
7688,very good course
7689,"Awesome content. Really inspired me to bring out my love for biology, chemistry and nature. The downside is that in order to fully absorb the content, its necessary to take notes while watching the lectures. His added effort turns what says is a 20 minute lesson into an hour at the very least. Besides the time consuming nature of this course, it was awesome. I love the awareness that it brings to people from all discipline about the potential harms that we are creating for our environment."
7690,Content is good and teaching material is of good quality. Some more examples of the application of the concepts discussed during the lectures could make this course even more interesting.
7691,perfect the
7692,Probably the most important course I've ever taken in my life and it was completely free. Already applied many of the concepts and have seen the difference. To yourself a favor and take this course.
7693,"Professor Him Fowler is FANTASTIC! He makes calculus thoroughly understandable, and memorable. His enthusiasm is infectious. Thank you, Coursera, for such a marvelous course. I will continue to Calculus Two."
7694,Very nice course.
7695,"Very good course with effective structure to help learning. The professors are great teachers and abundant experience resource, loved online courses made by Northwestern"
7696,"Awesome course! it was definitely a whirlwind of information, but the team at Manchester University really put together a great set of stories to what the appetite and lay down a foundation of knowledge needed to understand these politic-type processes."
7697,very useful and the lecturer seems so nice
7698,"It was great experience, however I would like to have little bit more then a one case study to work/ choose from."
7699,Excellent into. I would welcome a followed
7700,"Great course for introduction to programming, and it covers all the basis of MATLAB. Professor Like Fitzpatrick is an amazing (and funny) teacher."
7701,Very very entry level information.
7702,the best course
7703,"Course was quite helpful, but it is good for only beginners. Thanks for Offering this course."
7704,"Excellent and easy to learn course, given by one of the best teachers in machine learning.His has been a very fun experience, and very challenging as it was rewarding. I have already recommended this course to all of my colleagues and friends.Thanks for making this course available to the public."
7705,"Fantastic Course, taught wonderfully well by the three extraordinary instructor. A definite to do for an introductory understanding of the international legal system."
7706,"It has a little expensive suction fee than other courses such as Data Science (John Hopkins) and Data life (HarvardX_edx). But I decided this course rather than choosing the others because I felt that it was well organized and quite good supplement. That I like most about this course is instructor. The looks like enthusiastic to give a her idea and wisdom. It attracts me to take this course even though it is expensive relatively. Anyway, I appreciate her for dedicated teaching in advance."
7707,Wouldn´t finish it because assigmnets were not grade.
7708,Covered all key aspects of construction project management.
7709,"Not through the first week, and started second week. The axillary video are great. Right to the point. The course itself has been very true to what it offers. It makes you get your hands dirty very quickly too."
7710,Very easy to follow and nice and easy pace.
7711,His is an excellent course. I am looking forward to the capstone project.
7712,"THANKS A LOT!!! I LEARNED THE BEST WAY of DEVELOP HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT. THE TOOLS GITHUB, SUBLIME AND BROWSER-SYNC ARE POWERFUL."
7713,Love it! Great valuable material and instructor.
7714,I like this but there is quite a bit of data and into to cream.
7715,"Well the course is reasonably well organized the material is in great detail exceeding what I would've thought the overview concept of big history would be. Other big history courses I've taken do not go into specific date and time detail, period by period But function more in terms of how preceding events may be causative for future events (more like a butterfly effect analysis over long periods of time).Of you are looking for more detailed specific history than this course is useful. Of you are looking for more of the big history overview concept this may not be the best course for you."
7716,"His course serves as an excellent introduction to machine learning. I had a full time job for the duration of the time I spent working on this course, and I found I was able to immediately apply the things I learned in this course to my job, sometimes even really surprising and impressing my superiors with the technique that were covered. Andrew is an inspiring and effective teacher, and I feel I will retain the knowledge I gained for many years to come. Suffice it to say my passion for this field has been united."
7717,Excellent resource for getting up to speed with some of the challenges that the accountant profession is faced with. I do however feel that this course and the accountant profession as a whole needs to the consider the repercussions of rapid technological advancement and how these would impact the profession as a whole. The Accountant of tomorrow will need to be able to delegate the mundane daily tasks associated with financial accounting and bookkeeping etc. and be able to think and act more like business people. The course should also look into this aspect.
7718,"I liked this class. I have mixed feelings about this course not using due dates. In the one hand it's stress-free because I'm not penalized if I don't finish the assignment in a timely fashion. But at the same time, I'm less motivate to complete everything. Luckily I am a completionist so I did everything I needed to complete the class. But I can't say the same for everyone..."
7719,"Funny, Easy & extremely useful."
7720,very useful
7721,Knights into the process of learning is invaluable
7722,Great course. His course is designed to make it easy to learn and implement various machine learning algorithms and technique.
7723,the course seemed to be more feared to artists/composer than technicians wishing to expand or father their skill set
7724,Great Course!! Ruin questions needs to be discussed or solved by the support staff if needed.
7725,"Excellent, practical, connect you to day to day life."
7726,It was very information!
7727,"loving this course, theoretical , but not naval gazing path. very traumatic thoroughly and well explained.excellent!"
7728,"That this course can improve is it should adopt the habit of thinking more instead of writing. Because in the week 5, the quit is much more difficult than all the exercises we have done in previous weeks. And we don't have the guide step by step like previous weeks. I do know we have a week 5 quit guide. However, when you write queried, sometimes, you do think your logic is right and query is right, why can't I get the same answer with the choice?And when I finish the quit and look back to the answer, I even can't find the logic difference between answers and mine but the reality is I can't get the correct result. There is only one if I have found in one specific question, that is, I didn't use the same format to define one constraint. But I do think my way is also fine and I also get an answer I think is totally correct from the logic.To I do suggest the answers should not be single sometimes, you should consider some specific formats or situation when students write their own queried. On't give simple answer, give the reason why you are correct."
7729,I love the course it is nice for the person that works and wants to take the course at the same time.
7730,best learning experience
7731,Mostly a guide for teachers bringing classes to MOMA; weak otherwise.
7732,the course is quite simple and information. I really like how it is done as hands on experience not just lectures and assignment. I would definitely recommend it for beginners
7733,Very interesting course.Thank you so much
7734,"Good introduction, excellent instructor."
7735,Good revision for me of linear repression and basic time series.
7736,"Good material and final. Quizzes at the end of each week would be helpful. Also, the video could have been quite a bit shorter."
7737,"Thanks a lot May, I am cooking your recipe and my family love them. I adjust them to ingredient in my country, I from Peru. The knowledge is great to complement my work. I am a doctor, i got a terrified specially from ACSM, so the course is important for my family and my patients. Greetings."
7738,"I think this Course is a great introduction of Machine Learning. It's suitable for the new earners who are interested in learning machine learning. And Andrew G wisely designed the course, distinguished the mathematics and machine learning. To I can study it without reviewing the mathematics specially. I must thank you of and the members of forum. They helped me a lot, and provided so many materials and clear introduction. All in all, It's a great exploration. Thank you all."
7739,"A. G is a great instructor who is able to put himself in the position of students approaching the material for the first time. His explanations are always quite clear, even to the uninitiated."
7740,"It is a recommended course for any teachers out there. Even though this course is rousing on teaching English language, I find that it is still helpful for teachers of any other subjects, even other languages! I thoroughly enjoy weekly assignment even though I have to admit that I didn't complete some by the end of the week. But, it is all on me because I am responsible for my own learning. Good luck to everyone who is taking this course and anyone who will be taking this course! Cheers!"
7741,Really helpful!
7742,"Seemed very basic at the beginning and then got a lot more involved in the last week. I felt there was a lot of code samples to be pulled from, almost so much so that you barely needed to write javascript. More like copy and paste. Glass was really easy. I did learn about some major topics of the DOM structure of HTML, so that was great."
7743,Thank you for a wonderful and enriching journey.
7744,"Well, the course offers well-explained concepts of the (difficult !) makarin Chinese language, and takes the student forward at a slow pace for the sake of absorbing instead of just reading. Thanks !of: try to do the quires without your notes ... so that it really starts sinking in. The questions aren't difficult."
7745,best teacher ever. thank you chuck
7746,Good course to build concepts of machine learning that is good platform to move to advanced level.
7747,Really good course. Well structures and with a great teacher. It is really worth it.
7748,His course changed my perspective about the process of learning.It gave me a deep understanding of how my brain works.It also provided important facts about memory and significant technique such as the pomodoro and memory palace. Or Rarely gave some really helpful tips to help overcome your stress during tests and showed how to make the best use of your neutral system.I'm really happy that I learned how to learn :)
7749,Vice introductory course on of. A few types in the sides could/should be corrected. West submission (though Active) should definitely be improved.
7750,interesting topics well presented and the assignment helped to apply the content to real life
7751,I very much enjoyed this course!
7752,"Very essential topics, but the instructor's delivery of content is inconsistent, glasses over explanations at time, ""us and arms"" a lot, talks extremely fast at times. Taking this course quite hard to follow.Disclosure: English if my first language. Not new to programming. Not new to MOOC courses."
7753,"That was a very useful and interesting class! Presented did a great job, and her materials were very use helpful and relevant!"
7754,Good course
7755,"A hands on course on the basic tools needed to process data from experiments, web data, etc. The final assignment demands everything learned throughout the course and it's a perfect example for what one would face on a daily basis."
7756,Awesome Course helped me a lot with basis of Angular of
7757,Well organized and easy to follow course
7758,I like that I could collaborate with other students.
7759,"Very good course. Excellent material, documentation and exercises. All with creative Creative Common Licence"
7760,North to invest your time.
7761,"The information is really useful and for the most part, decently organised, but of GOD Flex neuron is so painfully boring. I couldn't even tell you what his voice sounds like because it's so bland and monotonous that it blinds into the noise of the fan of my lawton."
7762,They take their time to teach through step by step for basic people like me. Thank you www.Coursera.org
7763,Vice course for me
7764,"Very well structures, clear explanations, and great additional resources to test and repeat the material. Thank you very much!"
7765,The way the course is administrator and explained makes it a pleasure to do. I am just sad I do not have time to enjoy it at a steady pace and have to power through it on Sundays.
7766,"Excellent first week! Promises to be a very interesting course. Unfortunately, I won't get back to it for a while, due to other pressing projects, but I'm looking forward to exploring it more later in the year."
7767,It is an excellent course.It tells us a specific process of doing a started company.
7768,"Very detailed, Liked optional sections also. Moved it."
7769,"Extremely basic into, not valuable if you have any understanding of the the space"
7770,"Fantastic course, easy to understand and yet challenging enough to reinforce and apply lessons taken."
7771,Perfect!!
7772,His course is the best course I have ever attended!
7773,I feel blessed to have the chance to take this course. I'm sharing what I've learned with all my friends and family. Thank you so much for offering all these great content!!!
7774,"Fantastic course, could not have been any better ! Very wise way to invest your time. Thank you very much to Andrew G for this."
7775,Very nice for beginners.
7776,"Amazing course! Exactly what I expected, and more. Thank you for take the time to create a good and understandable course in an engaging way. Of you are thinking to make another specialized on this, count me in!I look forward to hear about new courses from John Hopkins University.Thank you!Orlando"
7777,"I liked so much the course, because the teacher does have an excellent way of teaching the language."
7778,very very helpful
7779,looking forward to learn more.
7780,"I learnt some good tricks on this course, it came at the this time for what I was doing at work. I recommend this course as it covers most of the basis, and encapsulated difficult parts, all you do call a method to do something."
7781,"It is not fine that the courses close like every 3 months, I do this project with my school and we have just 1 hour a week so I have to change every time my courses with I do not like. I only like this course"
7782,Good design and very information. I would just like to see maybe a tax or easier way to access all the links given in the video without having to go through the video again.
7783,"Prof Djorgovski's lectures are excellent, especially Week 4. I may be based, as I knew much of the Planetary & Cellar material before, I didn't know much about salaries, so week 4 was all new to me. The quires are well designed to test the student's understanding.I'm giving the course 4, rather than 5, for two reasons: a lack of further reading, which many other courses provide; and the forms are almost completely dead. Generally I learn by discussing things with other students, with help from the instructor when needed. The course could work better, IMHO. His should not be interpreted as a criticism of Prof Djorgovski'lectures, which are worthy of Caltech!"
7784,"Great House, really loved it because the topic is there which is not covered any where and even though we all seek happiness."
7785,It was fun to expand my patron knowledge. Thanks...
7786,The course I enjoyed the most !
7787,"I get this course since I really want to learn on boasting. However, I think the course pace is too fast and should be include more 'non-greece symbol'. I have a background in biostatistic and epidemiology but I'm still having a hard time understanding lecture. I would say that this course is the most difficult among this specialization (practical machine learning is much easier than this). I bet many students will have a problem in this course since it's a 'beginner' level specialization.By suggestion is to 'slow down' , expand the lecture with more drawing/picture explanation, more r coming and get rid of those greece-symbol as much as possible."
7788,"Professor Charles Severance is great. Very straightforward, positive attitude. Run to learn Python. He covered some good material on the background of XML and JSON with interviews and reviewed concepts necessary to call both XML defined by Schemes XSD and JSON service with rate-limiting and south."
7789,"I have thoroughly loved and enjoyed watching video and attempting assignment. Also Prof. Peter and Prof. Dark are really good teachers. I learned all that I could better from them rather than back in college. Hope to do more courses with them and also continue being a Spartan! And yes, hoping to meet the professors in person someday."
7790,It is great! His helped me to develop my skill about science
7791,I loved it! You're very good at motivation us to become better language instructor! Thank you so much!
7792,Learning a lot in this class about OOP and class.
7793,The syllabus is carefully structures. Well defined topics and the content is very well written and easy to understand. Is a beginner I had absolutely no problem whatsoever in completing the course.
7794,Awesome tips on academic writing.
7795,Material is very fruitful.
7796,"Great course, it exposed me to quite a few ideas but i only felt that we could've gone deeper into the topics. For an introductory course, it was quite information though!"
7797,His is the best ever lecturer that I have observed. it's very much practical and would recommend every marketing aspirin to look forward to this.
7798,Quite phenomenon! I love it....
7799,really its very helpful for me and helped me in my College thanks you
7800,Great course for people that try to understand better how work the algorithms used in machine learning!
7801,Great learning experience. His course is so unto date
7802,Love this course. Love the teacher she makes grammar easy.
7803,"The course was very easy if you got prior knowledge in programming in any other programming language. However this was a pretty good introduction to Python. I'm wondering why you are still teaching Python 2, when most people are already using Python 3 already. I've seen there are major differences between Python 2 and 3, most examples learned here would give Syntax error in Python 3.I think this used to be an older course, recorded several years ago. That's why Python 2 is being used. Python 3 is pretty much mature now."
7804,"Being Australian, I knew nothing about Jefferson so I came to this course with no expectations. I found it fascinating as it explained not only about Jefferson but about the American model of Government and Americans unique view of their nation. It is sometimes puzzling to an outsider to see this super nationalism and allegiance to the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. Is an aside, I wonder what Jefferson would think of the apparent possession with the literal words of the Founding Fathers with respect to things like gun control. Very interesting indeed.Or Snuff is an excellent lecturer. You brought the topic aliveThanks"
7805,"Excellent! Simple to understand energy business economic, financial and technical issues, even if you aren´t related to this areas. And assessment are really made to ensure our learning"
7806,Very interesting material covered by the course. The Professor teaching it sounds a little dry.
7807,The laws in this course have fundamental flaws which mean they cannot be completed. His is a major failing in a paid course such as this.
7808,Excellent course. Outlines general principles and advises on practical implementation. Gentle learning curve.
7809,"The best course I had so far. Very thorough with examples to make it easier to understand basic principles. After completing the course, you will know the basis of successful marketing and commercial plan."
7810,Great into to causal effects. Gives great intuition.
7811,His course is done
7812,The course is vast. The Professor is to the point and doesn't lack knowledge in his field.I'd recommend this course for anyone interested in Economics. Moved it.
7813,It's simple but could be a way to refresh my memory.
7814,Very interesting!
7815,Mainly review for me but core programming concepts are emphasized and introduced very well in this course.
7816,Magnificent Glass! But I'm just a newby to Jazz so it takes time to absorb the material!
7817,"Examples that are provided in the course make it easy to understand and to apply in the real world. I have learned a lot about financial markets and theirs relationships with economy. Now, I have better fundamental understanding of investment decisions. It is one of the wonderful learning experiences I have had in Coursera. Thank you for bringing the specialization in more effective ways."
7818,"Thank you a most enjoyable and information course.Are daniel, e he my gate it genet!"
7819,Perfect if you want to get your basis straight.
7820,Learned much. Instructor was well organized. Subtitles were extremely beneficial.
7821,The evaluation forms of the last two limestone projects are quite burdensome for students to grade by item.
7822,Felt difficult in understanding the overall course in short duration . 1 month is not enough for this course. I request the authors to make the course much more simpler
7823,"It is an awesome course to start with, for whoever want to start a career or research in Machine learning domain. Amazing clarity in all the lectures, concept tormented quires and a really good set of assignment make this course a must watch for all who spire to be in machine learning or related fields."
7824,"Course is interesting, but tasks are way too easy."
7825,Or. Richard Leisler did a great job at engaging the student about this very current and pressing matter. I want to thank him and those who he interview over the whole course for taking the time to make this available online. I am inspired to help others who are effected by HIV/AIDS. I hope to one day be able to utilize my time into helping others.
7826,"I am a woman in my late was who has been limited in my life, my education, and my employment by lack of confidence in my ability to learn path. In Summer 2016, I will complete all of the classes for a of degree, all but two path classes. After completing Learning Now to Learn, I am confident that, while path may be a challenge, it is a challenge I will overcome.Thank you for sharing these learning tools with the rest of us!"
7827,Great introduction to statistics presented in a very interesting and engaging way.
7828,"The quires were too short to be effective, and without requiring written feedback from peer review, the process doesn't seem very useful. The best information was from the articles and books he recommends."
7829,Love the practical example!
7830,Love the patron specification so much and really make a lot progress.
7831,"Really liked the funny, old professor who gives most of the lectures. Good into."
7832,His course helped me much to understand the basis of C Programming.
7833,Great course. Covers the different aspects of the patron data structures in a concise and easy to understand way.
7834,His has been an excellent introduction to feedback controller using UVA. I look forward for the next session. Fully recommended if you want to dear of controller!
7835,"I had fun and enjoyed this class, do the work and you will learn clot."
7836,"Sometimes it was hard to understand the presented. But the information is well laid out, and accurate."
7837,Simply superb.
7838,Change my way of thinking and it made me live my life in a more efficient way.
7839,"I expected more path from an economics course. The professor is very good at explaining and demonstrating different topics, but it would be very interesting if we see the actual path, even in details, behind all of these concepts. I think most people who take this course have passed calculus 1 and 2, so a little bit of path would make it way more interesting and useful."
7840,this course is very good
7841,Great introductory course with very useful information and tips! Thank you
7842,Great course for someone who has never had a Philosophy course
7843,"I enjoyed it. Him Fowler does well, his enthusiasm and the time and effort he (and whatever filling and editing team he has) have put into the presentation is impressive. Difficult for me to rate it as a baths course - how would I know whether it covers what it needs and have anything meaningful to stay about the standard of it. I felt I understood what was going on, I passed the quires. Maybe that's all good?Occasional bug in the quires - nothing you can't work around (eg totally blank question but four answers to choose from.) The mathematical symbol rendering doesn't work on the mobile pp at all."
7844,"Any interesting technique to better learning and memorizing the material you want. But, IMHO, the concept of thinking isn't discovered by 100%. Also, I think, that material can be arranged more effectively to understand easier. Anyway, I am very happy, that I learned how to learn and the information is really helpful to learn. Thanks!"
7845,I liked the Course.
7846,"Interesting, well structures and presented. Similarly to other courses in the specialization, content is made easy to understand. Very good overall!!"
7847,I learned a lot in this course. The instructor was clear.
7848,Hard to follow for non-native speakers. Especially week 2. There are a lot better Courses on Entrepreneurship on Coursera. Especially the Technion ones.
7849,Good class. not much different than the Arduino one. Useful to learn and use SSH with line if you do not have a monitor for your Raspberri I.
7850,Great!
7851,very concise and to the point. just the type of introduction to of that I was looking for!
7852,"I enjoyed this course and felt it to be a good introduction to Bootstrap.The time allocation were not realistic, though. I have a fairly strong (albeit outdated) background in programming and web design, but I still felt that I spent a lot more more time than what was allocate for learning. I imagine that this can be very discouraging to beginners.I am looking forward to the remaining nodules."
7853,Prof is amazing!!
7854,"Didn't get much into the managerial aspect of a data analysis. Instead, it covered best practices for conducting a data analysis. Not the same thing and a little disappointment."
7855,"Great insight, high-quality video, good assignment"
7856,Very good course!!!! It reaches a lot!!!
7857,Lovely lectures with easy to follow up mathematics
7858,Great introductory course!

7863,it's perfect
7864,Very good head start!
7865,A good introduction to a very broad theme
7866,Topics are well-chosen from tons of materials and not only stimulation but hardware laws are supported.
7867,Great course!
7868,"The course is pretty good, but not mobile friendly course since the font size becomes way too small for visibility. Hence learning is not possible while travelling by train / car to utilize productive time.Otherwise, content-wise it is pretty good."
7869,"I found the way in which John Hopkins present the course, very valuable. Well structures, although the pace is quite fast !"
7870,The course seems like it would benefit parents but does not do much for a nutrition health professional.
7871,His course is very information and inspiring.
7872,Very useful framework to use when negotiating. Totally helpful the practical activity to do an overall review.
7873,"I really had no knowledge of music producing or the history of music until I started this course. It has taught me much, and I'm sure the lessons I have learned will have great benefit now and in the future."
7874,Some very useful points. Would recommend to anyone who struggles in understanding punctuation.
7875,"Excellent introductory course for simple web applications. Covers basic layout for responsive design, javascript coming and structuring of the final project. Everything is explained very well and thus the course feels easy (although if you have never before seen HTML, CSS and/or Javascript, there are plenty of new things to learn) - especially the later assignment for Javascript. I feel at least the last assignment should be somewhat more complicated."
7876,Thank you for your lecture!
7877,Or Rogers is a tremendous professor. The course has wit and application along with assignment that are well scaffold to the learning content. Highly recommend this class.
7878,"He ha ayudado much en mi via professional y personal, se lo recommends a took.His course help me a lot in my professional and personal life. Everyone should take this course."
7879,i love the explanation
7880,For people who want to enter the world of statistics...this is the course.PERIOD!
7881,Rough around the edges. The assignment are not clear enough. I never got contracted by my enter and didn't know how to reach out to him either.Content is good.
7882,Very useful!
7883,"Very useful, covers the basis of machine learning. Easy to follow."
7884,Challenging course but worth the effort!
7885,Such a wonderful course! It will help you walk through a challenging path to learn cava.
7886,Excellent! I have learned how important is our role as a teachers even with our body language and how to motivate with the correct language my students to succeed
7887,I really liked it.Interesting and thought provoking.
7888,"Amazing, thank you all."
7889,Great course. Or Chuck is fun and to the point. More practice problems would be welcome.
7890,Very well put together. Excellent useful phrases.
7891,"A very powerful course, I would definitely recommend any of my colleagues to do, especially, the ACCA holders who like to take the current Masters in Professional Accountancy."
7892,"His is the most practical, comprehensive, and best course on machine learning. Professor Andrew G makes all the difficult concepts very easy to follow based on intuition. I look forward more courses like this and also a specialization in machine learning from Stanford. Thank you professor Andrew G and please keep up your good work!"
7893,Very good course.
7894,Very good though a steep learning curve at the last lessons - inspiring lectures as well as practical cases :) Looking forward to the next of courses :))
7895,"I am grateful to Professor George Siedel and all involved in the teaching process. Or. George Siedel aptly explanations and a great teacher.grateful,Antonio Arms"
7896,It's absolute grate.
7897,excellent experience going through the course
7898,Vice learning experience. Or. Chuck is awesome lecturer
7899,"I liked the course and the assignment. I felt that the assignment covered materials which weren't part of the course or not explained well enough. I managed to get through them, but it felt lacking."
7900,Brilliant into! Also a great (easy) of filler :D
7901,A must for improving.
7902,His excellent course has been a great help for a non-native speaker like me to improve my writing in English.
7903,Awesome course
7904,Amazing course!
7905,I think whole course was well explained but sometimes I had a hard time to get a key point in video.
7906,"Pretty high level overview. I guess it's necessary to give a roadway for where the concentration leads, but I wonder if each lesson couldn't have been added in its respective module, or if at least the Foundations Nodule couldn't be shortened a little - or alternatively made a bit more challenging. I'm on the first real module now and the change in difficulty is quite significant."
7907,It was very helpful for me.
7908,Really Really Interesting !! :)
7909,Good learning start to learn web development :)thanks
7910,Great course!!! i learned so many things and now i see the in a different way the importance of a good nutrition to my kiss..

7917,Great introduction to a variety of machine learning technique with plenty of course work to help put into practice the material in the lectures.
7918,"A quite simple beginning, might end up being a little bit too simple. The future looks promising, though!"
7919,Week 4 was the best and the more appropriate for the specialization.
7920,It's a very clear and easy course for new student involved into machine learning !
7921,Good but can do better.
7922,Awesome course ..
7923,Or Member is a great teacher and it seems a great person too!
7924,A brilliant beginners' course for an introduction to accounting and financial analysis. Prof. Paul Kaufman is an added asset to this course with his simplistic definitions and examples. It definitely has a lot to teach and much to take forward in a corporate career.
7925,Everything initial to learning R Programming.
7926,"His course has expanded my basic understanding of how marketing should work in social media. I have a different perspective on how to approach marketing and what my focus should be on in terms of tends, listening, and connecting with others on social media platforms. I really enjoy the content of the lectures and the opportunity to see what other members of the course are producing."
7927,It was a well taught course
7928,I learned so much from this class! I really look forward to utilizing this material by modeling my new midst ;)
7929,Excellent course! I like it very much. Thanks for it!

7931,It's a great course however most of the assessment depend on peer trading
7932,Great classes by great instructor. Air explains things to a begginnner in such a fashion that no doubts arises and the lecture is really crisp and clear
7933,"I dont like the tools they used, it seems like a promotion for their company."
7934,"Right be a good introduction for those completely new to computational tools, but not useful for those with any background in git or R. An be safely skipped."
7935,Great Course and very information
7936,"Course material selection, pace and presentation are all well thought out. His sequence of courses in the Machine Learning specialization is truly exceptional."
7937,"His course is extremely good, I had never seen the world from a leadership stand point and it gives me more than I was expecting in terms of training and leadership skill. Last but not least, a final thanks to all the Copenhagen Business School who have contributed in this course and have shared their unique experience so that I go out into the world and lead by example."
7938,Lots of good information. Perfect for beginners and for pro. I
7939,"too good, highly recommended"
7940,It's really good! the reason that is not 5 is that there are some son errors with the exercises/lessons that confuse you.
7941,I have big expectations with this course !!
7942,I strongly recommend this course to all who interested in Astrophysics.
7943,Very good for those who doesn't have any knowledge about programming or even computer
7944,A wonderfully designed and insightful course!
7945,Interesting introduction to models.
7946,"Highly recommend this course. Thanks to Or U, I have got an more clear understanding about machine learning, and I'll make myself learn more."
7947,"His was an interesting cancer basis class -- quick and simple for those with minimal background in oncology. The only disappointment was that the course description mentioned quires could be taken for no cost, but that turned out not to be true. Nevertheless, it was a valuable course."
7948,Very beneficial information in this MOOC!
7949,"Great course, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!"
7950,"Practical, engaging and extremely information"
7951,Good course!Very easy for beginners!

7953,"It was great. The tasks where challenging, the explanations were simple and concrete. I loved it."
7954,"Very challenging course. And I thought I knew Python.I learned much, much more about Hands, idioms, lambs, regret, etc. I will be able to be more productive at work with all this. Thanks."
7955,It too fast.
7956,"His is in my opinion the best course on computer hardware for beginners ever created anywhere, to date. Met ready to think and work though. It's not for lazy people that want it easy.Completing every module is a rewarding and satisfying experience and the teachers are great."
7957,A great course for beginners who want to understand fashion industry.
7958,Thorough and at the same time easy to understand.
7959,Very interesting lecture video which makes it a great learning experience.
7960,Great way to get into Scala and learn about Functional Programming too (for beginners to Functional Programming).
7961,"I think the selected topic were really interesting ones but since i´m not a scientific background it was kind of difficult to follow some of the discussed concepts and ideas. And that was because not always these were explained from the very beginning and a lot of them were only mentioned, as it was supposed that we had to know them previously. Maybe with a little more time for the video this would have been solved.In any case I really enjoyed it and I think it is important to have the opportunity to watch these courses and come to learn where are the stages of these matter. Thank you for the effort!"
7962,"Great material. Exceptional and very descriptive video by Prof. G. An't expect more. The course structure is beautifully shaped and this certainly adds to my of like a charm. It would have been better if we had signature track for the course though. For everything else, it's as good as it gets."
7963,Clear and practical. I'm loving it :)
7964,"Excellent course. Thanks Coursera, Thanks Or Chuck."
7965,"Takes a bit of time to get adjusted to the workflow. It's a bit trial and error, especially if your using Windows. West bet is to use a unit-terminal so if you have windows use a terminal like It Wash. Overall it's a very good course and gets you into the meat and bones of Web Development. Must remember to come with patience and do things on time :)."
7966,"An Harris, the lecturer, is a very cool guy. I really enjoyed learning about various concepts through his way of teaching. His course provided me with a solid understanding of of in general. Recommended for all. Regards."
7967,A brilliant and inspiring introduction!
7968,His course is very very helpful. Simply just loved it.
7969,I love this course! They really went in on different content in this one. Definitely recommend to content creator.
7970,"I ve learn a lot about specific details, mechanism and angles to motivate others and bow myself.The course is accurate and well illustrated .I 've enjoyed the intelligiblity of the two men delivering the video content.I recommend the course to any one since it for sure will enhance the fluidity or relationship at work and private life."
7971,"Vice course! I've learnt a lot. Thank you, David."
7972,Very interesting
7973,good into to hands and some jump. students need to deep dive into each subject to become proficient
7974,"i would like to recommend it to my friends and my classmates, it is a great course that deserve your attention, do not waste it!"
7975,"Amazing course! Conversational, relaxed lectures that are well-informed, haired with excellent arrival forage--mostly generate by the presenting professor."
7976,Terrific course. Provided a great mix of technical knowledge plus the theory behind it. The extra material filled in a lot of banks and de-justified how the internet works.
7977,definitely worth following..
7978,Excellent next step course in the series.
7979,His course introduces the related topic in a simple yet interesting way. The lecturer knows how to teach and is an expert in his domain. Very good choice!
7980,Absolutely enjoyed it
7981,"Thank you, it gave me good basic for JavaScript."
7982,"Fantastic course: deep and insightful. Professor Soto-Bones is a wonderful and wise lecturer, I strongly recommend this course to anyone."

7984,Really good ! I learned a lot about R programming.Thank you very much !
7985,"Of you love computers or programming, this course is must."
7986,"its good course,By only note is the instructor talk real fast"
7987,"very useful courses, thanks !"
7988,Great course! I really enjoy all the video and lectures.
7989,Good basic skill for creating clear and compelling graph for visualizing data
7990,Very useful course. I highly recommend it.
7991,"Great overview, but not enough of a good thing; I would have liked for the course to be a bit longer and go more in detail. Still an interesting course for beginners."
7992,Very interesting course! I loved it!
7993,It's great course and give advice for effectively managing your time and increasing productivity
7994,"Of you are considering this specialization I would recommend the Andrew G course instead and the main reason is that it isn't depend on proprietary of framework. Despite the good lectures, the assignment don't help you develop the knowledge required for of developer role.Taking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery, from summer 2016 to summer 2017, finally the most interesting part of the specialization was canceled. I'm completely disappointed with the specialization learning experience."
7995,Very Good!
7996,"Python Data Structures is a good course and well thought out. There are plenty of resources to help the student, my only recommendation would be that the assignment more force the students to use the relevant concepts rather than allowing work around. I occasionally felt the homework could have been structures to more step by step steer me to use concepts from the most recent lesson."
7997,just as good as part 1. Seat old professor. A bit more abstract than 1.
7998,"His is a course that I would recommend to everybody, it will allow you to better understand how your brain works, you will also be able to identify bad practices, that are stopping you from really understand and master a certain subject.Barbara and Merry did a great job explaining the concepts in a clear and yet entertaining way.Now that I have completed this course, I have a whole new structure on how face new concepts and how to effectively learn."
7999,I did learn a lot about learning. I recommend it. I will apply these principles.
8000,It is helpful but not deep enough in some concepts.
8001,"A great way to learn a new language is through use, using Will to teach the language R and at the same time concepts in data science was such an efficient and effect approach. Thank you"
8002,"I really enjoyed how expert Professor Each is on sustainable development. He seems to know a lot about the subject and we can see a spark on his eyes when he is teaching. Moreover, the lectures and quires are comprehensive and well organized.However, apart from the last Week, I think that solutions for the many problems that Professor Each presents are not showed properly. Although there are many issues unsolved, there may be a lot of good examples throughout the world to be presented together with these issues.Mind Regards,Rodolfo"
8003,Andrew is the best Machine Learning teacher!
8004,"best of the best, theoretical and practically"
8005,I love this course and would like to do it again!
8006,"His is a great introductory level course to give an overview of the basis of music production. It's a little more focused on songwriting than I had expected, but there is a good amount of technical information as well. You won't come out of this course as the next Steve Albini, but you'll definitely have a great starting point to build from."
8007,It´s perfect!
8008,Awesome .. I love it :)
8009,Really good staff!I've really used this knowledge yet!
8010,Excellent course structure to gain exposure into what to expect out of this specialization.
8011,"Great course! Pain points I found useful:1. Actually implementing the cost functions and gradients in MATLAB really made the formula sink in.2. Bias-variance trade off: plot the learning curve of train & of error vs number of samples to determine whether you have a low bias also. Of not, going 'big data' won't help.3. Ceiling analysis to figure out which areas to spend effort on improving."
8012,"Great course with inspiring lectures using eye opening examples from their practice. To matter if you view your self as a manager, investor, consultant, market, or employee, this course is designed for you to get the essentials right so that your company can thrive while you work in happy environment. Very fundamental and very necessary!"
8013,"Moved the real-world concepts, great started course on HTML, CSS and of"
8014,The Applications in Engineering Mechanics course is a must for any engineer. The material is presented in a logical and straight forward manner with applications to the real world. Or. Whitman is truly a a great teaching Professor!
8015,Fantastic review of the brain and the effects of harmful substances. Thank you.
8016,"Excellent course and very well taught. I was amazed by how clearly it was explained to people who may not have a background in this field, it is definitely useful for those trying to transition into new careers and understand more about digital marketing through areas such as SEO. Thank you!"
8017,Thank you! It was very interesting and productive for me
8018,very good entry lessons! very helpful for me!
8019,It is great learning experience..
8020,"Thoroughly enjoyed the course. Starting from zero, I have reached somewhere in this topic."
8021,The teaching methodology was superb!!It worth spending time in his lecture.Hope to have some advance study soon in Python which shall be freely available to earners who keen to learn something new but cannot afford the suction fee..
8022,Great learning time
8023,Great course
8024,I really learned clot from this course. And it will help me stay on task in my school work and help guide me in a more effective way to manage my personal goals and responsibilities. I highly recommend this course.
8025,"I Love the lessons, the task, its didactic and you learn a lot :)"
8026,Great instructor and lessons. I love the organisation of the course and it really provides a great basis for looking deeper into aspects of graphics design! Looking forward to doing the other courses in this specialisation.
8027,Very interesting co
8028,His was my first Coursera course and I liked it so much I enrolled in the next one.
8029,I learned many different ways to improve my overall email communication and I am really thankful to the course instructor Merry Wanders for his time and efforts.
8030,Excellent course! I would have liked to see a brief discussion/depression of anonymous classes and their usage. I also found the recommended reading to build nicely on the concepts presented.
8031,"A lazy reviewed gave me the score of 0 and left me this comment: ""I am not able to give any score, I tried very hard to understand the matter but it was difficult for me. I have to score it just for me to check the other student's work. Please don't consider my scoring here."" I studied hard and received this poor evacuation. I screamed for help many times but no one replied to my request. The quality of the course is superb and my experience is completely ruined by a thirty score which does not reflect my work."
8032,Great course. Relevant ad practical examples and case studies.
8033,"Wonderful course !! I have been trying to gain practical machine learning algorithms but some online materials were too mathematical and others were too introductory. The hands on laws helped me gain the concrete understanding of concepts and confidence that I could build a simple of system by my self in the future. Also, practical information during the class will save me tons of my hours if I will build any of applications in the future. I really appreciated this class and it was a happy time. I really thank Prof. G with all my heart !!! Thank you very much.."
8034,It was a very beneficial course. He learned a lot of things that we can apply in life.
8035,Very good and helpful! I appreciate Or Think! Thanks!
8036,Having successfully completed 'Getting Started: Agile Meets Design Thinking' I found this module partially confusing. It is also based on Flex Iowans' venture design process but this time on each step you do things that differ from what was taught in the previous course. Things seem to be complementary but you should not expect to go through a structures process over all courses. They are all based on the same process but shed light on different aspects.I also have the impression that the didactics of this second course still could be improved a lot. Quizzes are currently remarked and bags fixed and the team is very responsive.It still was a good learning experience and doing Design splints is a great approach. From the review of assignment I can say that a few students seem to adapt better to the structure of the course that I did. But most seemed to be equally if not more confused. Going reviews wasn't fun because formally most students got enough points but content-wise I perceived it as rather mess assignment to review. :/
8037,Awesome course covering fundamental concepts!!
8038,"Course material providing out-dated concepts. Argumentation throughout the course is shallow, many of the the current arguments are not mentioned - from both sides of the energy lobby (fossil & renewables)."
8039,Socially relevant philosophy and psychology: great material! Crystal clear! Everyone should watch this course.
8040,The course is so basic to learn and to know. The lecturer is very funny.
8041,Great!
8042,"MySQL lessons, quires and assignment are very well organised and taught. But was not very happy with the Teradata part. Overall it was a very good course! Ana is a fantastic teacher."
8043,"I love science and this kind of courses make me love it so much more, Thank you!"
8044,"To far taking the trail run before the lessons begin, I have learnt so much and its easy to follow a long and understand. Your lessons are extremely creative as well.Thank you for making it easy :)"
8045,One of the awesome course on classification. Must so perfect for learning.
8046,I rate this course excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed my learning experience. It certainly opened my eyes and improved my knowledge. Thank
8047,Great course from top professional!
8048,"lessons were simply taught, easy to follow and instructor was delightful pleasant. I learnt a lot!"
8049,"I learned a lot, it's full of important information!!! It's a very rich course, I highly recommend! Thanks for the team involved to make this course happen!!"
8050,"Practical hands-on real life examples, exercises and assignment!"
8051,"Excellent overview of machine learning technique !Even if the subject is complete, it's easy to understand, and a good starting point to go deeper, as a deep human learning can be ;)"
8052,Met the collaboration stage and improve the resolution skill for conflict.and recommend more useful books for further analysis.
8053,"It' amazing the kind of vision this course gives in helping others. It's not only applicable in the workplace, but with friends too. Everyone will benefit from this course, not just managers or leaders."
8054,"Fascinating course so far, with useful concepts and great assignment designed to improve learning by applying framework and concepts to actual companies. Would highly recommend!"
8055,Too basic! An't even do the quit without payment!
8056,Vice work love it! Thanks for the great support!
8057,very good course
8058,"A thorough Psychology introduction, from background, to nowadays with stops in all key topics (Psychology main branches and fields, biological explanations related to Psychology, Social Psychology, memory, mental illness, etc.) explained by Prof. Steve Joordens with real passion, a truly great communication, with a deep knowledge of all topics in the course."
8059,"It was incredible how I could understand why I teach, the way I teach and what my students want to learn. Thank you."
8060,"Great course! one of the best that I have ever seen in Coursera, very well driven and great content, Carry is an amazing bright teacher....would be great to get some more courses from him"
8061,Incredibly inspire
8062,Great course! I learned a lot. Thanks to the instructor!
8063,Very insightful!
8064,Really helpful contents.. Presentations with examples are awesome.....
8065,"Of you're expecting a decent tutoring on Bootstrap, this is the course for you. Of you're expecting a course on fundamental of design and implementation concepts, you might be a little disappointed. Overall, well presented with a fun restaurant mock web site as the final project."
8066,"Taking it again, as I loved it in previous session. Thanks for doing such a good job, all for free."
8067,I fell in love with this course and definitely enjoyed the presence of the teacher!
8068,A really nice overview of tools used in Data Science!
8069,Provides an understanding about project management.
8070,His course is an excellent prime for this topic. It's really well gauge for general interest public and it does not fall short for whomever would like to go a little further. I will extend a policy chapter on a course I teach on Environmental Science.
8071,"The course requires lot of effort and thoroughly enjoyed. To be honest the case preparation was challenging but worth taking as that improves first your writing skill and then applying your thoughts to come to a valuation. Is the professor says you can value anything once you understand the beauty of finance , i surely believe that is the case. Wishing all the best."
8072,His course is a great introduction towards machine learning and the package used graphlab create is really easy to use as well
8073,"I am very fond of the way the course material was presented. I found the definitions and proofs to be vigorous and intuition at the same time, which is of great importance when learning such material. The accompanying textbook is great, too. Although I was already familiar with parts of the material, I thoroughly enjoyed the course."
8074,"Given this is the third (or fourth) operation of this course, it's telling that the errors from the original release remain in the video and quires. There are other, higher-quality Data Science MOOCs available."
8075,His Course Had Help He in By May Trade LTD Business in Swandam
8076,"Thank you, Professor Chaikin. It's a fast-paced course but deeply focused in important topics of html fundamentals, iss use and organization, javascript fundamentals, and consistent ajar basis."
8077,His course proves to be quite helpful while writing a paper. The video are quite understandable and the dynamic to follow the course allows participants to be fully engaged.
8078,"Too base for experienced people, not enough fundamental for beginners.After 2 weeks didn't find any useful information, it also very boring, so recommend to see video on 1.25 -1.5 speed.The course need to be significantly changed:1. Who are the target audience. Now many resources do we have (time etc)3. That we would see as a result of course (knowledge, skill (hard, soft)etc."
8079,unable to do assignment wo today is last date
8080,Great!!!
8081,"Really loved the structure of the course.John fellow's lectures are even though they are a bit boring in the initial stages, they are very important and they create an life long impact on you if you try to focus.I love the way how berkeley professors just carry the whole course just sitting with a black background.It needs great skill and experience to have such confidence in presenting a lecture like that..I'm always thankful to course for providing this educational courses. Coursera and Berklee college of music for life!"
8082,"I would have preferred a more mainstream compilers, i.e. Ellipse, rather than the provided blue. But, the blue compilers is capable and the lessons taught were appropriate to one with minimal programming background. Not stated, but I would recommend a student in this course have a basic understanding of path, i.e. average, highest in a set, lowest in a set, etc. Of you are intimidated by those concepts, you may be challenged in this course."
8083,Assignmetns allow student to choose dataset and analysis - but are not very well structures.Detailed explanations.
8084,"Easy to follow, very well explained!"
8085,"I have no hesitation recommending this excellent course. Whether studying, finished studies, or helping others study, this course provides great insight"
8086,"His course provides many useful tips for building a blow and writing good blow articles, I gained a lot after taking it."
8087,I absolutely loved this course! I learnt so much from it!
8088,"I wish we could still get a course certificate, even if you haven't paid."
8089,The course is perfectly designed
8090,Great course if you are thinking of teaching or if you're learning another language.
8091,great course
8092,Too much basic stuff about Twitter and how everything works in detail. Would be more advanced.
8093,Material is fantastic. Instructor explains this very well and exercises are useful.
8094,Excellent teaching
8095,The course material provide good reference and study for world design.
8096,I think that this will help anyone that is trying to get into the Trophic Resigning industry.
8097,Short but essential
8098,great course
8099,"Such a tough science , easily explained"
8100,"The course convent is lively, personal and enthusiastic, which helps keep the learner engaged and interested.All the concepts discussed are exemplified explicitly via simple case studies, so that earners can make sense of new, abstract knowledge.The learning material is broken down into logical sequence, bite-sized chinks, and there are plenty of concept visualisations - the illustrations are great!Thank you, Annemarie and Team, this is a fantastic course."
8101,I really appreciated the course and have found it very helpful . Men To !
8102,All was super
8103,"Challenging, information, relevant... It's a lot of work to follow the course and to pass the assessment but totally worth the effort. Is someone who works in a digital role in advertising, un grand merci to the team at Institute Lines-Télécom who put this course together."
8104,"Support was pretty good but I spent a lot of time trying to fight through the thicket of version compatibilities. They introduce a lot of interdependent elements in one short class so that is definitely a feature. I would recommend learning Ruby elsewhere if you're completely new to it before starting this class. I paused to work through the very awesome ""Head First Ruby"" book and it gave me the skill to move on. That the course does well is show you how these many interdependent elements work together: Ruby, Nails, Sublime Next, hebrew, bent, respect, httpparty, hero. It's a lot to take in and you really have to explore each subtopic a little more on your own to make it work, but you finish with a pretty rich understanding of the ecosystem of tools and framework you need to be effective if you do. Definitely overall recommend, but know that you're going to have to do some work on your own."
8105,Great conceptual level overview of many topics in and related to space and astronomy. Highly recommended.
8106,Thank you very much for the course.
8107,"I think it's too simple but not clear in the deep learning part, especially the subtitles!"
8108,the structure of this course is well organized and interactive at large. Even beginners will not find themselves lost in the process since there are multiple sources of assistance along the way. Highly recommended.
8109,"Fantastic course. By only criticism is that the teacher talks too slowly. Fortunately, this is easy to remedy by increasing the speed to 1.x."
8110,I've always been a fan of the Measles. this course gave a great perspective of the Measles phenomena from a musical and a business viewpoint
8111,"short and sweet. The course is quite short but covers the true essentials of conflict resolution in a professional environment. the only reason why I did not give five stars: the concept of Active Listening, although mentioned all over the course is not really well explained."
8112,"Great course divided by two gentlemen professors who lived through the era with personal experience. I loved the division of literature sources and historical events which knitted together harmonious, and I liked also the lectures tremendous. Thanks. Or John Quincy, of, MBA, MLA, DDS, (+104 Coursera Courses and counting)."
8113,"Vice course! It is definitely a beginner's course, and my only complaint is that in order to be able to take the capstone course we will have to pay for and be terrified for this course. I really think there should be an option for people who aren't absolute beginners to enter the track at a later point and still be able to get the full cent and/or do the capstone. After all, this track is feared toward using Python for analysis and data science, which is hardly a topic that is for absolute beginners.For what it is, though, namely a very beginning level course to teach the concepts of programming with Python, it's very well executed."
8114,"The course was well structures, providing a wealth of information package in concise video, alongside additional documents for further reading. of was also designed in a manner that required a proper understanding of the source material and not memorisation."
8115,The class was very good!
8116,Fantastic... very well written!
8117,"Last and to the point. The way i like it. 3 weeks and you're set up to where you can get around in HTML, CSS and Cava."
8118,"Or. Old's course ""The Challenges of Global Health"" serves as a great introduction to the field of global health even to those without a health-related education or work background. He presents this course in a necessary perspective to draw attention to the pressing global health issues that affect every single specie in this planet we call home."
8119,His was very information course on memory and learning. I have learned so many new technique and am learning how to apply them in real life. Thank you for the course.
8120,"Really great course that was able to explain concepts in layman's terms! To easy understandable, makes Finance less intimidating :)"
8121,"It was difficult, but interesting"
8122,"Hard Topic, You must take all the basis in multivariate statistical analysis first."
8123,I've learned so much from this course. Not just about the whole writing process but also some valuable information on how to get your work published. Thanks for opening this treasure chest for new writers like me! Cheers!
8124,Excellent course. Instructor spend a lot of time on clearing the concepts.It cleared many of my misconceptions.
8125,I have learnt so much from this course.I thank course.
8126,"Of you have absolutely no foundation of what the basis of business, then this is for you. It's very simple and direct, but make sure to follow this course up with lecture material that goes slightly more in-depth. I recommend U of Penn."
8127,Very interesting course. It can help everybody in their learning projects.It's a petty though that we can not get a certificate if you are not verified and pay for it.
8128,One of the best courses I have ever done. I wish I had the opportunity to learn this 25 years ago!
8129,Very disappointed at the lack of notes and course material. I hope part 5/5 improves.
8130,Excellent course for beginners.
8131,It's wonderful!
8132,"I learned a lot in this class. There are slight gaps from the depth of material covered in the lectures to the quires and assignment. Of you're good at searching online, you'll be fine."
8133,Awesome stuff.
8134,"Really information,designed specially for beginners.Thank you!"
8135,Good for states..
8136,Very good course. Learn a lot.
8137,Although I'm completely new to of with no background. I was able to get clear picture of concepts thank you for bring wonderful course.
8138,Excellent professor! Excellent classes! Outstanding methodology for online on-demand house... strongly recommended!
8139,Very good for beginners.
8140,"Some useful points, however I wish they taught the class more generally. The focus on classes and exam tests isn't as useful after you've finished school."
8141,"The quality of the content is very good. However, the content should be more detailed. Further, certain key subject-areas are missing such as the fashion calendar, quality control, merchandising, cool-hunting and forecasting, market research, event management, public relations management, retail operations in more detail, logistics, store operations etc. Overall, however, the course is a good overview about managing fashion and luxury companies. Moreover, interviews with CEOs and brand directors would make the course more interesting."
8142,His course gives actionable ideas about design characters and story lines.
8143,Very interesting course.
8144,"The best course I've studied. (not only in Coursera) Your Learning skill, and more importantly, Understanding of Now learning works can Improve magically through it. You can learn better other things with it. Thank you Or. Barbara Valley and Or.Merry Sejnowski. Happy Learning!"
8145,Awesome Course......
8146,i have learn so much!!
8147,His course is the best course I have ever taken. It covers all the topics very well. And importantly I love the treat at the end of every week. The ultimate showdown between the two best instructor.
8148,"Great course and loved hearing not only the subjective experience from people of what they were taught, but also brought things to the table to discuss on rational level without hostility as well as finding some objective truths in this discourse and lessons in the class."
8149,Excellent!! It is a great opportunity to get new skill. I really recommend this course.
8150,"Very good material and structure overall, overall meets my expectations!"
8151,Very information
8152,"Easy to understand and well formulated content as well as interesting.Keeps me curious and holds my attention.Especially like that every video is short, so there is time to ponder and contemplate after each session."
8153,"His is my first course lesson, it's the beginning of me in of. the."
8154,"A wonderful course to learn or brush up the use of comma, conjunction and tense."
8155,Or Chuck is great.The assistance on doubts is also really good.
8156,Very good to gain basis in the financial terms and tools.
8157,In interesting course. Sides were in French but read the script in English to understand
8158,"I found Wesleyan University's course ""The Ancient Greeks"" rich in varied information. Professor Andrew Szegedy-Maszak's lectures are particularly thoughtful and the quires are clear. In altogether enjoyable, well-worth experience."
8159,Excellent course and very well structures. Great for the begins. But also great for someone who are involved in innovation management to affirm and strengthen their knowledge too.
8160,Great course for beginners in game development.
8161,Superb. Or. White's presentation style is the best I have ever seen. He is engaging...
8162,"Great course! Engaging video and excellent teaching. In addition, the topics are explained in a clear way and with extra care in complex points."
8163,Glass was fun to attend. Everything was taught from the very basis. Great. :)
8164,I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I found the lectures and the visual tools engaging and have been incorporating some of these ideas into my routine with great success. I have also been sharing some of what I've learned with the students I work with as a Learning Support Assistant. Excellent!
8165,A great process for any writer.
8166,Awesome course! Learnt a lot!
8167,"Thank you for giving this course, I hope there can be more."
8168,thanks
8169,really good for beginners
8170,"It's a great course and help me a lot. Learning this course gives me the basic sense of how the machine learning works in practice and I also get to know the basic algorithms, how do they work and where should I use them. Thanks again!"
8171,It was a great experience and fun! I strongly recommend it to everybody who want to get solid knowledge in web and computing at all.
8172,"Really nice course about Python for people with no knowledge about it. Looking forward to other courses regarding Python because video lectures are very interesting, on point, and funny."
8173,"West course ever, very hands-and tormented, practical example applicable to real life business innovation projects."
8174,Very helpful and practical course to learn about data pouring and cleaning.
8175,The case studies included in this course really hammer home the principles being taught.
8176,I am learning so much! Great Instruct
8177,"Take this course. The lectures are amazing and the senators in the discussion forms are super helpful. I guess i grasped maybe 60-70% of the course material but that has more to do with the student than the teacher. When i find the time I will visit the video, this time in conjunction with Prof. Mehrling's book ""The New Lombard Street"" and all the reading materials (I skipped some) which take WAY mare than 10 minutes to go through."
8178,"For me, it's the best course about of."
8179,All thanks to A'am Pollen van Went that now I can style a nice webpage even a whole webster. The teaching method is marvelous. Assignment was also reasonable. Everything in this course reaches something and develops skill in us. I can feel the difference before and after completing this course. Recommend every Beginner to start this. It's Marvelous!
8180,"I know it's difficult to encourage student participation - in the 'discussions' for example - but a bonus of some kind for participation might do the trick. Not sure whether course software provides a means of measuring participation, but a count of 'substantial' comment posting might be a measure.By the same token, compulsory comments on the peer reviews would be helpful for feedback and also to indicate whether the peer reviews have been posted yet."
8181,That a fabulous class. I am happier already.
8182,"Very very basic into course... Great for students new to programming without a C, C++ background"
8183,I really like this course and got a lot of information about Tireless Technologies.Any thanks for both ( Coursera.org & Onset Instructor)West regards
8184,It would be great if there were more practice. The theoretical material as always on top.
8185,Great course to give you into for using patron on the web.
8186,"His course really tortured me , but really worth the time and effort, I did learn something by heart :)"
8187,Excelente thank you
8188,It is a nice course.
8189,I LOVE this course! Thank you!!
8190,"His was a well structures and simple to understand course. I found the video style learning full a great image, examples, and more easily understood that a traditional lecture. The topics were diverse, thorough, and interesting. I also appreciate Watt Peter's knowledge of wilderness exploration. Great tips from a seasoned guide."
8191,"Good introduction to linear repression. The quires are moderately difficult, and can be somewhat time consuming. There is a lot of depth to this topic, and the this course touches on a lot of it, it won't be enough to get a very thorough understanding. In general I'm really glad I took this course"
8192,Excellent way to understand the litigation process. Excellent way to evaluate the knowledge
8193,"Great course on how to manage Innovation programs and management expectations. You also learn the different stages of managing an Innovation program in any organization.It has really benefited me to learn about Innovation Management. Thank you Coursera & Trismus University, Rotterdam."
8194,"There is more work that what the video show, but the book and the curate notes are more than sufficient"
8195,Full of insight. Highly recommended for organizational leaders
8196,Great start. The textbook are most valuable. The 101 on Github is a little bare bones and could use an update.
8197,Very useful knowledge to acquire for those completely new to SEO.
8198,"Great course, thanks a lot for teaching me valuable lessons."
8199,"For me, Amy Shopman is the best teacher so far."
8200,"I learned a lot on this course. Sequencing, sequencing antibiotics. Lamina sequencing using BaseSpace. I attended an Lamina seminar in person ( that I found on the webster and by serendipity was coming to my city) and understood everything, because the experience with this course. I wish you can connect the sections with relevant papers (Tavel have so many that is hard to choose one)."
8201,"Very good course. Or. Charles, is a good instructor."
8202,It was interesting! Thank you!
8203,Awesome! Story about storytelling! His is really useful to me as a data scientist who needs to explain technical details to business audience in an engaging manner.
8204,I really did not understand this course. There was way too much margin.
8205,"The course is ""a must"" for everybody and on top it's a great fun and a lot of positive emotions!"
8206,His course is pretty cool. I actually learned a lot about analyzing narratives and writing that I hadn't really considered before... It's totally worth it.
8207,The course does not make you learn spreadsheets in detail.
8208,"Content is 5 for sure. The fact that they keep suggesting to go for a verified course however is a little bit annoying, so 1 star off for that. I think it would be more appropriate to give an option to disabled future asking similar to how rating on Android work. That being said, the course is excellent I'm taking this for pure fun and it really is, ... fun! :D"
8209,"I t is a great, course, quit are not hard but they provoke an important questioning and are part of the learning process. Assignment are more interesting every week and strike the most important topics of the week while using remembering a lot of the past concepts. It will be great of after the course is finish the student could download the homework."
8210,It was a great course and well recommended for beginners
8211,"Great Glass!I like that the Professor encourages understanding the concept than memorizing.In the long run, understanding will always triumph over memorizing."
8212,Excellent courseThank you. God bless you
8213,best course on machine learning available online and also best course on Coursera.
8214,Very information in regards to the basis of Python. Thank you Coursera!
8215,a good head start of of courses
8216,"Or Muppala and HKUST have produced a real winner here. The lecture material is explained very well, and the exercises are carefully drafted to focus your attention on the current lesson without being distracted by stuff that is not necessarily relevant. The course build on previous courses, but those are not necessarily required for understanding this one -- it stands on its own. By the end of the course, the student should have a clear understanding of how Angular.is works, what are its strength and weaknesses, and how to build applications using this tool set. Supporting tools (build tools, test tools) are also covered."
8217,Great course that should be mandatory for any Coursera User
8218,His is a nice entry-level course on Machine Learning. Emily and Parlor show their enthusiasm for of and engage students in the subjects they are teaching.The video lectures have a nice format in which you can see the professor while he/she is explaining the presented sides. His makes the course feel less online and more personal.The course makes special emphasis on the practical side of the presented material. All the nodules have a practical part in which you practice the theory presented.
8219,A good place to start learning any programming language.
8220,The professor does a great job of explaining the content in an easily understandable way and is very practical. The assignment require very minimal adjustments to sample code from the lessons so this is far easier than a typical course or say the do MIT into to patron course. I came in feeling comfortable in rudimentary patron and leave now feeling a lot more prepared to use those skill manipulation the web and calling APIs.
8221,A very inspiring course!
8222,great course and easy to understand
8223,"It was amazing!!! I did not know that I can study in Berklee Online, I am in love! Thanks a lot!"
8224,I really enjoyed and learned new knowledge that will support my career and happy to implement in my
8225,Not to learn a lot! Thank you!
8226,"The information was interesting but sort of long. In fact, I started this so long ago that I don't remember most of what was said, only that it was long. I did enjoy the first course, America's Written Constitution but someone was paying attention then and it was on the older format so it was better. I rate the course so poorly, however, because of the total lack of staff involvement and the worthless peer review papers. I have a huge problem with the peer review process. It is of no value and should be banner. He that as it may, however, it takes weeks to get reviews and there is of ONE FROM THE COURSE STAFF PAYING ANY ATTENTION of THE COURSE!! There is not one posting from course staff in the forms. There has been no response to any of the so called, ""comment on this assignment"" messages I've been leaving since JULY. There has been no response to an e-mail, supposedly sent to the instructor on my behalf by the Coursera help desk weeks ago. It is obvious that the instructor has abandoned this course. Of no one is going to pay attention to it, it should be taken down. Of you just want the information, watch the video but don't expect anything else, including any response whatsoever from this course. I've wasted too much time on this. I'm done."
8227,It was harder than the others but I thank you for that! I learn a lot about the class structure and got a better idea of what things I need to work to became a teacher. Thanks!
8228,Very promising!
8229,Classic machine learning course for beginners.
8230,"His course explained to me comprehensible what a Product Manager does which is already a good thing to start from.In addition it really gave me some insight into modern ways of managing a development team.Therefore I would recommend that course to anyone working as a developer and not knowing what these ""was"" are doing."
8231,Now. AMAZING COURSE. yet again...
8232,Must great!
8233,excellent tactics to influence people .
8234,Pretty good to learn for novice
8235,The course covers up all the basis in the most clear way. Definitely worth the time!
8236,It was an insightful course which looked at key strategics most often ignored by social markets. Bandy did a great job on that expel sheet for the capstone project! Thank you.
8237,Very well presented course. Thanks!
8238,flash needed otherwise would have been 5 stars
8239,"The teacher is very nice.I rate it with 3 stars only because this course does not contain any information about chinese hieroglyph. In my opinion it is the main part of the language, and should be included."
8240,Excellent course. Have a very good understanding of Financial Markets. Professor Or. Mob Miller was exceptional and very inspiring. Thank you for a great course.
8241,Not the funniest one but very useful !! thank you !
8242,"Useful course, separated into great topics and within a reasonable time-frame."
8243,"great course, sadly i can finish on time"
8244,"His course was excellent. Grand is an incredible teacher, passionate, engaging and knowledgable. I learned a tremendous amount about clotting it out from this class - in fact, one of the benefits I got is that some level of intimidation I had about building a plot was alleviate. The lectures, materials and exercises were all so useful and absolutely thought provoking. Thanks!"
8245,excellent book and pacing of the course
8246,Great course about Bootstrap
8247,Run course to start learning programming. Materials are well taught.
8248,Great course!
8249,"Great course. I learned database essentials before, but this course presents content way better."
8250,"The movie clips at the beginning made me wonder if the course was going to be worth it, but once you get past that, it gets very interesting"
8251,Thank you very much. I finally understood the essence of the theory of relatively.It is very very interesting course.
8252,Great one!
8253,Wonderful course with wonderful instructor
8254,"Tremendous course.Explanations can be terse at times, especially after going over quires (where you may only follow what is going along if you successfully solved the quit, otherwise you may miss important insight), but on the whole, lectures are very strong and help you gain a working understanding of functional programming.The assignment are carefully drafted and really give you an opportunity to try the stuff from the lecture. Definitely felt like I learned a lot during the assignment.I found that the last two assignment took more than the recommended 3 hours (closer to 5-6 for me), so plan accordingly.Personally, I found that this course is even better if you read through the first 4 chapters of Functional Programming in Scala (http://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) before doing this course. By getting two separate, excellent explanations for the same topics, I was able to understand the material much better than just from one."
8255,It is great
8256,"I love the example stories, very simple and effective. Thank you!"
8257,Awesome course and especially awesome faculty reaches all the concept so well and adds some humor as well very satisfied :)
8258,"It was an entertaining course which you can build things on paper. Which is nice if you are not friendly with computers. The only not-so-liked part was try to fit the assignment in a single side Of page only. He had 4 assignment in each of the assignment except one, we are encouraged to build our assignment on previous assignment. To I needed more 2 papers in the last because I included graphics, a story, explanations on how to play, on multiplying, etc. But it is fun, so it was worth trying it."
8259,I am very happy to learn from this course!
8260,Very enjoyable and useful.
8261,"The teacher spoke very clearly, but the transcripts of each lecture should have included the Ilyin transcription. Without them,they were no help."
8262,"It was a great learning experience! Or. Chuck left no stones unturned in making this course remarkably comprehensible and student-friendly. Thanks a lot, Coursera and Or.Chuck!"
8263,Had fun taking this class and learned some new things. thank you.
8264,i like the sound of teacher。i love of、
8265,"poorly planned, irrelevant to the subject test questions."
8266,"Week on NSURLSession and CoreData is ok (but compared to other courses on Coursera - so and so). Everything else - not very good. But anyway, quick dive into swift."
8267,Very useful tips that would improve your learning habits and believes. such a great course!
8268,Superb! I am very thankful I took the course. By warmest gratitude to all especially to John and Ve and the whole team for being so generous in sharing their expertise and providing us all the reading and video. God bless everyone!
8269,His course teach you how important is to have philosophical mind.The overview of what philosophy is in the first lecture is awesome. In further lectures they go into tools of philosophy and major questions and arguments for them.But you have to read the hand out and have to work yourself through the course.
8270,"His was an information class. Is a ""newby"" to the Coursera community, I wanted to take a course that would expand my knowledge of art and culture while fitting within my hectic work and family schedule. Photography is something I engage in almost daily with my shone, so I took a chance and was not disappointed. Sarah Sister has curate a wonderful assortment of photographer artists that typify the historical and aesthetic advances in photography. The articles, video, and slideshows were well constructed around the theme of each module. The articles would benefit from including some of the images discussed. His was not a major problem as I was able to Google most of them. The video were interesting and of sufficient length not to strain my attention. The slideshows were my favored documents due to the inclusion of images and explanatory text. I did find it frustration that some of the answers to the quit assignment could not be found in the required reading, video, or slideshows. Is an education, I can certainly understand wanting students to think clinically but some of the questions were misleading, unanswerable based on the content, or appeared unrelated. Any of the items did not assess my understanding of the information so much as how closely I read for specific quotes or other esoteric content. His is further evidenced by the posts in the forms requesting guidance about certain items. Overall, the course is worth the effort and time if you are interested in the history of photography and its most notable practitioner."
8271,Very simple course that can get you into programming with no prior knowledge!
8272,Great course helping to extend skill for people interested in spatial analysis
8273,Excellent course with great series of tutorials.
8274,Fantastic course. The topic and the presentation were on point.
8275,"really enjoyed the course, found it easy to understand but still had a feeling of accomplishment every time i finished an assignment."
8276,It's very helpful for the people want to pick up his first language! A great course.But for the folks who have studied some other language it's might be little bit too easy and not content-intensified.
8277,In excellent course. Will recommend it to anyone who is serious about learning.
8278,"Thank you Andrew, this course really inspire me."
8279,"The teacher`s pronunciation is really clear and easy to follow.And the movie makes me really relaxed and motivate me to the wealthier life.His course is useful to change your view to foods.After this lesson,I became to avoid fast food restaurant and try to eat vegetables and fruits."
8280,Takes the more difficult photographic topics MUCH easier to understand!!
8281,I am really enjoying this course
8282,Great materials
8283,"It is a great course of Machine Learning. I had a great time watching the video and doing the exercises. Andrew G is one of the best teachers I've ever seen, so thank you Andrew."
8284,His is one of the best end enjoyable courses of Coursera!
8285,"A course I should have taken 20 years ago, but still find it useful!"
8286,His was a great class. The professor did a great job breaking down concepts with concrete examples and assignment.
8287,"His course is very practical, I would recommend everybody interested on learn makarin"
8288,Very Vice course. Easy to understand and practice.
8289,Informative course! I really learned a lot.
8290,bill and lost of fun
8291,Round it both interesting & challenging!
8292,Great course!!!
8293,Engaging Course. A lot of Assingments. Really structures information.
8294,Excellent course! Learnt a lot when I actually got to see a webster being developed from scratch!
8295,"Great course for a beginner. Instructor and student assistants make sure that you get the basis and (most important) grasp the concepts behind the code. His is very important because next to the keywords and santa the most crucial thing to be learned is to start ""thinking"" like a programme. Now to break it down to the necessary incremental steps.I personally like the combination of video lecture, on-line student notes and on-line lab. Getting Python installed locally is a breeze for Windows or Sinus. Already enrolled in Course 2!!"
8296,"His is a great course! It definitely helped me in framing my started idea. I would personally suggest starting even *before* building an MVP to gauge initial interest: Time is your most valuable resource - don’t spend any more than necessary on something that you don’t even know is actually viable. Another point I would make is to not mistake your friends & family for your target audience - sometimes there may of course be overlap, but a “yeah, that sounds cool” from your friends & family doesn’t cut it. There's something called “Interviewer bias”, which means that your friends will rate your ideas more favorably than the general public. I've personally used http://www.ideacheck.to to get an initial sense of whether my ideas might actually be valuable. They take care of generation a questionnaire from the idea and put it to a panel of users from your target group. To far, the response to my ideas was mostly negative, but I've gained valuable feedback through this process."
8297,"Great course overall, just an issue here or there, but great experience for the most part."
8298,His is one of finest course to know the basis and to enhance the microeconomics principles. Professor explained all concepts with simple examples that we will never forget.
8299,good information shared
8300,Thanks a lot. I was very happy to take this course. It was very interesting and the teachers were very clear and passionate. I learned a lot of tools which I intend to implement. I would have liked to know more about what to do with manipulations.
8301,A nice course for begginers in expel which includes business data.
8302,I just started course 2 ... and loving it!!!!A lot to learn about!Thank you Coursera!
8303,"Superficial coverage of quit and final exam material in the video lectures. Without getting the textbook and reading it in depth, it is difficult to do well in this class."
8304,"Very useful course, interesting enough to let me continue By Specializations!"
8305,I help me a lot
8306,To far I've gone through the first week. Lots of business and technical into. The video quality is AMAZING!!
8307,"It's wonderful, thank you Andrew."
8308,Great Learning Experience... Thanks
8309,little bit slow but very good. some extra tools added that make it slow and boring but it makes it very interesting if we understand its benefit
8310,"The course is very good, the teacher very clear, easy to follow. In yet it is a basic course"
8311,"By far the most effective tips on learning I've ever had. I've learned how to focus, how to optimism my efforts, and how to learn without having to fight myself."
8312,very good introductory course!
8313,Thank you!
8314,"His is a fantastic MOOC: it has depth, exercise questions with solutions, challenging assignment and background material. The quality of the lecture video is excellent!"
8315,very good content on how to measure and improve processes and products
8316,Fantastic! Thanks so much to Or. Miss and Coursera.
8317,very interesting materials about RDBMS and nose systems
8318,It is a great course.
8319,Very information
8320,one of a good course on course
8321,"His course was really great for improving my Unity skill, specially concerning programming on C#. A very hands on type of course! Takes you feel ready to develop games for mobile platforms and computers alike."
8322,"Professor G is a great teacher, his course is both challenging and satisfying. The exercises require you to take one step beyond the lecture -- not just parrot back the transcribe -- you have to think about the implication of what you've just studied. Met G's presentations are lucid and information and that next step is obvious, once you think about it.By greatest challenge is that, although I have been programming for decades, I've only doubled in a functional language like Active and my last path class dates back to the was. However, the path requirements are not onerous and I'm struggling through the Active assignment with some success.Although the course is 11 weeks there are more than 16 lectures as some weeks have two complete sets of lectures PLUS there are assignment every week that take a few hours to complete. To while there is a little more work in this course than in other Coursera offerings there is great value for the money and time spent.Of you're interested in Machine Learning this course is a great place to start."
8323,Outstanding introduction to Beethoven's Piano Sonata. It has spared a great interest in me for these pieces.
8324,"It´s a great Course for inexperienced Looks. Most of the recipients are very Basic but I think they encourage People to cook even if they´re not used to cooking a lot. The explanations are very clear and easy to follow. Personally, I would have loved to hear more about preparing and storing homemade Good (freezing, storing in wars etc.)"
8325,I really enjoyed this course. Have been using Python for years but never jumped into data management and visualization. His course helped me doing that and presenting results in a beautiful and useful way.I am not rating with 5 starts because the rating system is cumbersome. I submitted my first assignment late and they were not peers to review my work so I am still waiting after a month of rejoining the course.
8326,Great Learning!
8327,His course is great if you are looking for learning responsive web designing using Twitter Bootstrap. Not of areas are covered in this single course along.
8328,"It is an amazing and inspiring course, which corrected many wrong understanding that I have about study."
8329,Eye opening. Great professors and interviews. I recommended this to many friends
8330,"His was a most information course. and for me. not an easy one by any means. For an under-graduate, I would say is essential. Well done! And thank you!"
8331,"To far this course is fantastic. I have taken classes on this subject before however, the personal touches and the passion of both professors is contagious !! I recommend that all high school and secondary students should take this course, lest we forget and repeat these atrocities. Thank you both for a fascinating look at a terrible time in history!!"
8332,Very good course. Covers the key aspects of negotiation in useful bitesized pieces.
8333,Really great course about data science in patron and hands in particular. Absolutely recommended!
8334,"Good, and explicit, and well organised course.The only drawback is, it's not free......Sorry, too poor to pay...."
8335,"Unlike the rest of the nodules in this specialisation, this one was well taught, a good blend of theory and practice and well paced.There were still a few issues with wording in quires (and some where there seemed to be two identical answers to one question, where one would be considered right and the other wrong - purely chance). In addition, the lack of consistency in how to submit assignment across the specialisation is frustration, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a way to show how to use github or something like that, but it shouldn't be the case."
8336,Great course. Fantastic lectures and the whole approach of the course on how to tackle important decisions when there is an ethical side.
8337,Simple technique and very useful for improving our professional as well as personnel efficiency.Increasing self confident.
8338,a great unique course with exclusive interviews and presenting fantastic artists and works
8339,very convenient to understand and learn.
8340,His was my first introduction to Typography. I played around a little with calligraphy as a hobby. I learned so much from taking this class and by far my favorite.
8341,"His is the greatest course i have ever taken online or office. The instructor has full control over the subject matter, if it was not for this course i would consider of a thing for the baths wizards. Thank you so much Andrew of for starting course with such a great course."
8342,Sons: Rests are too easy.Gros: Interesting stuff though.
8343,West Machine learning Course
8344,Very good teachers and interesting video.
8345,not easy to understand but it's a good course indeed.
8346,Very well presented and detailed
8347,nice presentations and interesting pretty well i had learned and enjoyed
8348,very practical. While also providing an academic explanation of new marketing concepts
8349,"Overall this was a great class. The programming assignment were the most valuable part of the course for me and were good practice for wrangling data with hands. I did find some of the assignment asked questions in a way that were confusing and it was difficult to debut the answer based on the automatic grade. However, I'm looking forward to when the rest of the specialization is available, as this looks like a good track!"
8350,The course seemed not to be prepared with anticipation. I left it because of that.
8351,great course to learn about GIS
8352,Well organized and easy to follow. Great learning experience.
8353,Very detailed and well covered topics. A very good course to introduce a budding IOT enthusiast.
8354,I liked the way the lecturer went through all the material slowly repeating information.
8355,"Really great course. The lectures were instructive and detailed without wasting time. The quires tested well that you understood the material, and the assignment made you learn not just how to do machine learning but how to do it well and intelligently.I can't imagine a better way to learn Machine Learning than with this course. The only potential negative is that those of us like me who started this course being terrible at matas/octavo have to become competent in it to succeed.I highly recommend this course to anybody who wants to learn Machine Learning. There isn't a better resource out there."
8356,Excellent! Very detailed insight
8357,Good one. Detailed.Too much of video clips from television etc. An avoid those.
8358,"It has been one of my favorites MOOCs, I would say a top 3 of the best courses i have taken.Even though you have to work so hard to deal with the homework, you are going to learn a lot. Professor Dickson is a great master in his field and he explains so clear. I really recommend this course to those who love electronics and want to develop their own projects."
8359,His course made learning patron simpler and fun
8360,Awesome course. Learnt a lot.
8361,Good beginners and introductory course to Arduino and C. Prof. Harris is a brilliant lecturer.
8362,Great course! I wish there was a statement of accomplishment available when I complete it.
8363,Is a beginner course this is good. Everything is illustrated with examples but most of them are classroom type examples which help in understanding but have limited use in commercial applications. of a started course for these subjects this is really good.
8364,Very information and easy understandable for a newby in Project Management like me.
8365,"The content of the course is accessible for those newer to the study of Buddhist or psychology, at the same time offering new and intriguing ideas and resources for folks like myself who have some experience in both studies. Or. Right does a brilliant job of guiding the student through the materials using interview video with experts from across discipline. Of any changes were to be made to this course, I would suggest incorporating other kinds of video and adding a reference list of all the research reference during the course (providing the research would be especially awesome - the Science of Happiness course does a brilliant job of this). Any thanks for the opportunity to learn from and dialogue with Or. Right and all his accomplished and interesting guests."
8366,A great way to learn about recruitment and selection. Full of interesting resources
8367,"Awesome course, especially for Jazz pianists!"
8368,"Excellent course, very interesting and challenging!"
8369,Caught in the best manner possible.
8370,His course is very information. I love it.
8371,I found this course very interesting.
8372,"Great stuff, interesting packed & skillful presented!"
8373,"Really I haven't seen a course with sides till now,To one will be interested to take a course like this, with some sides to read from."
8374,Basic into to Etats & R. Very good if you are starting either / both.
8375,Outstanding course. The instructor looks very experienced and the examples she demonstrated were very good. The explained each concept in detail which a person can use in his/her project. I will definitely refer my friends to take this course.
8376,"The best course so far (still not doing 4,5,6). It is more complex than the first two."
8377,Covers the most used processes and practices!
8378,"One of the best professor, I have learned so many things from the 4 classes."
8379,It was like opening up a door to a whole new world. I have discovered new tools that I will thoroughly enjoy to use for the exploration of data and for predictions. Thanks Team Coursera !
8380,His is very good course for beginners and a bit advanced programme.
8381,Very good course.
8382,"One of the best and most interesting courses I have taken a part in. Very demanding and frustration sometimes but absolutely brilliant. Interesting lectures, problems to solve, etc. Small improvement in my opinion can be achieved in two areas:1. I could not get used to instructor's showmanship and he sometimes covers up the sides.2. I would suggest changing submission format not to post code but solution. In this case we would not be limited in programming language's choice."
8383,"Really fun, light introduction to the specific of Cava"
8384,It is a good introduction to the field
8385,Great course. Moved the content and its delivery.
8386,His course make a good introduction on machine learning and offers many advice during analysis.I think that it a course everyone should take if you have interests in machine but you're beginner.
8387,I would like to have more participation on the forms
8388,K. It was a return and there wasn't much help in the Forum and there were too few exercises. But it was really interesting.
8389,Vice course the teaching was so simple.
8390,It is a well designed course and I highly recommend to take this course
8391,"Sides are poorly edited (too much blank space, the bullet points are not clearly visible, there is no narrative or discursive structure, the diagram are not clear, and the interviews are raw and united). Sessions are too long and include too much irrelevant information. The little useful information there is, is not structures clearly and thus it's harder to learn. The material for the first 3 weeks resemble more to someone talking about ""the good of' days"" rather than a properly thought-out history class. I had to leave the course as I found it to be a waste of my time, and I am glad I decided not to pay for a certificate for it. By expectations were a lot higher for a University course."
8392,Very good .. congratulations
8393,Highly recommend who wants to get into and learn more about machine learning to take this course! The instructor really knows what he is talking about and explains concepts very well.
8394,"Great Glass, I have learned a lot stuff"
8395,"His was my first course I did on course. I very much enjoyed it. Even if you think you've already got your learning failed down, you will pick up little things of this course that will help you learn even more efficiently. You could decide your on pass because all the material was online which was very pleasant. The MOOCs were very clear, and the little quires at the end of the video gave you direct feedback if you understood the discussed material of the video."
8396,Very nice and interesting course.
8397,Any thanks to Him Fowler for the excellent course!
8398,It was an amazing introduction to a newby. Concepts were being cleared and there was book to read and understand about the course.
8399,YOU TURN of of
8400,Great course for beginners. It gives you the basis to become a good programme.
8401,I like Or. Dixon. He is just so fun and make me have deep impressions of all the scenes in the class!!
8402,"Excellent course, I am really impress with explanation of instructor of this and specially interview video, which are included in end of every unit help me lot to understand more about topic."
8403,Very cool the course!!!!
8404,"Interesting introduction, hope following courses will be better!"
8405,Great and very useful course and knowledge that you get you can really apply in classroom.
8406,"Thanks to this course, you will act more confidently in your business, you will use professional tools and knowledge. To you will bring security. His tool will change your life because you will do it your way but in a manner understood and shared."
8407,His is very Good course for basic patron programming.
8408,"Very nice and interesting course. The material was very helpful and the way of delivering is very easy to grasp and understand. Thank you, Barbara and Very!"
8409,Great content! Must have fun and learn new things about into graphics
8410,I found the course very information and interesting. The variety and concentration of detail was impressive and the lecturer always engaging and clearly strongly invested in the material. He was also very sensitive to his audience. I would certainly recommend the course and hope to find other courses run by the same lecturer. Thankyou.
8411,"Interesting course. But definitely not for beginners. With a designer background, I could never accomplish this course. I really hope Penn could offer course in such topic for beginners!"
8412,His is a great course!
8413,"It first it turns up a little difficult, especially the second week but it's all there.The community was great, the discussions helped me a lot."
8414,To comprehensive and detailed. His course allowed me to review several classes from my MBA in one place!
8415,"Good course for beginners. I've picked up the glances of branding via reading materials outside of this course, through my professional network, etc. and hence I was expecting more from the course.Also, I would like to mention that the quality of video lectures can significantly improve as some video that were shot in an external location had too much noise and it was a distraction to focus on the lecture."
8416,"Excellent course that holds one's hand through the field of of and provides a hands on guide through the in-video questions, quires & assignment tutorials. A great confidence builder."
8417,"very detailed introduction of SQL. The only thing is that there could be more video introduce different functions instead of writing documents as materials. Other than that, it's a great class"
8418,"I am glad i took this course. It is very enlightening, and would help me as a future nutrition and exercise expert. Thank you."
8419,Very interesting and helpful course!
8420,The lectures in this course included theory and examples on PCA and SVD - however this was missing from the practical materials
8421,"I have been learning ruby on rails for a year now, introduction to ruby in this course helped me a lot in understand ruby programming classes and it's object orientation. Course explained a lot why i need to be ruby expert to shine as rails developer.It also helped me to understand lot of stuffs which i did blandly in rails before, like adding attr_accessor in class etc., are actually from ruby.I'm glad I found this course. Looking forward to do next module."
8422,Excellent!! His course gives a nice introduction about Machine Learning.
8423,"Of you want to understand the all main principles of learning, you are at the right place."
8424,Brilliant course. To incredibly thoughtful and challenging all at the same time. Thank you for changing my approach to learning. I continue to push this course out to everyone I know.
8425,Fantastic class!!Very engaging and practical. The instructor is easy to understand and takes you through the course with simple narratives but very technical at the same time.I wish the course will link up graduates with going projects for lamenting the knowledge.
8426,I am new to programming in Python and Or Chuck makes this all very easy to understand. I am pleased with my progress.
8427,"His course so far is really very useful in my academic and through this course, I am now well-versed with all the marketing strategics used in the industry.I would like to thank the professor for teaching us so well."
8428,Excellent course for beginners
8429,"I have learned how to make a market research, a business plan and a elevator pitch."
8430,"It is a great course for Ruby newer, but with some experience in programming.Congratulations for creator."
8431,"Great great course.I'm a beginner in this matter so to me there are cases difficult to understand. One thing that could help a lot would be more exemplar of real life for each theoretical concept. Is done at the beginning with coffee, late, coffin, act.Thanks for the energy dedicated to create this course."
8432,"Excellent introduction for a first time researcher. Very helpful and well structures. Thank you, I am inspired to continue studying as I feel more confident."
8433,"Good course. Sometimes too easy, but go to start."
8434,I re-learned some basic concepts from a different point-of-view despite practicing electrical engineering for the past 20 years!
8435,"The course is all comprehensive about models and concepts of communication science, however the break-down into small lectures turn out to be too brief in my opinion to develop rich understanding of the subject. It would be more conducing that lecturer expands more on the cutting edge study and research, to give people a sense of the finding of the field and its benefits."
8436,reviewing the classmates assignment should only be possible after submitting the own work.some more sophisticated programming challenges should be required.
8437,Excellent teaching and concise material on the sides!!ideal for beginners
8438,There are many helpful and useful technique from this coarse than I plan on trying to utilize in the future.
8439,Vice course. I got basic information from this course.
8440,"Originally, I rate this course 3-stars. However, I have since decided it is worth 1-star after taking the next course in the series, Bootstrap. I thought that there wasn't enough time to cover all the material to make this course good. After taking the next course, I see that it is possible to deliver a lot of material and concepts in short order. However, it takes thinking, planning, and education. I think this course is TERRIBLE and seriously needs an overhauled. After taking this course, you barely know any CSS and despite passing assignment that don't challenge, you're probably worse off than a student who fails in school.The course suffers from the extremely short timeframe. Covering one of each of the three core topics a week is just insufficient to provide any sort of depth to this course. While there are supplementary reading, Coursera and the participating institutions need to understand that there are those who are taking courses to get more than a one page Wiki style coverage of a topic."
8441,Very information and well structures course!
8442,Very practical course!
8443,Great Course
8444,"For me as a complete beginner in typography that was a really information course. It is a beginner's level, lets you understand if you want to study typography further or that would be enough for your purposes. Thanks!"
8445,"His course have been very thorough in explaining concepts, and providing examples with explanations to review. The pace is just right, and it has been easy to find time to follow along with the course material. I am finding that I am actually looking forward to each session."
8446,Very nice course for clearing the concept of the advanced search algorithm and applying them in the real world scenario. Well designed course and programming materials.
8447,"His was a really good experience for me, i learned how to properly punctate a sentence, add sentence variety, use of introductory phrase as well as transitions. I highly recommend this course!"
8448,"A course that pick up well from the previous one in the specialization. Difficulty level increases marginal, yet remains perfectly accessible for beginners and intermediate earners.You will need to invest more time towards the last 2 weeks of the course as compared to the initial 2 weeks."
8449,"His is an amazing course, I completed the week first and learned a lot of stuff regarding communication, I am simply having an amazing time doing this."
8450,Very good choice for you to walk into of
8451,Great course: professor Zelikow puts into perspective facts that give us an understandable course of History and the role played by choice made by people rather than reviewing purely theoretical explanations or ideological tends to base conclusions. Really enjoyed it!
8452,Very complete!
8453,The course is outstanding in building character and modeling one attitude toward society.It help me a lot to be a better and effective person in society.
8454,"Interesting class, but somewhat frustration at times. I found the quires very conceptual, which was interesting, but trying to find the correct answer with no feedback as to how something was right or wrong made for a weaker learning experience. Had there been some feedback to understand why something is correct or not, I think that would enable more learning.I also think more emphasis on Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics would help ground this class as a more general class for students interested in robotics. Introduction to Jacobins and how we can calculate end effect forces with respect to joint tories would really help interface this class with some of the other classes in this Robotics specialization. It seems like it sticks out the most.Still. Interesting class and I learned some new stuff!"
8455,they have to put a note that this course is just for Turkish students not for international .
8456,"In excellent course for those interested in an introduction to classical studies. I studied roman history and latin at high school, and I was eager to learn more about the ancient greeks. His course provided me a great introduction. And it raised my interest in reading ancient greek authors. That was the strongest point for me: no need of animation, I liked the invitation to read ancient texts."
8457,Thanks for this perfect course!
8458,Run and information. Very creative.
8459,Great overview of Blended Learning. I highly recommend the book Blended as well.
8460,good started course
8461,Excellent course! I studied animation but I didn't know much of the world aspect for game design. His course it's also helpful for animation field.
8462,Excellent for fresh
8463,"It is a very good course. However, I must admit that is discouraging making the course because when you do the course free you do not have the opportunity to make all the exercises. Despite that, it is very good."
8464,it becomes much easier to learn swift with this course
8465,"Getting up the environment is often the tricky part that deter people from moving into, or back into coming. His class provided me with a hand-holding needed to start coming again. I recommend this course as a kick started for those who were on legacy environment."
8466,"His course gives a concise into to the basis of project management, largely based on PMI PMBOK guide. The course is useful to get acquainted with or refresh knowledge on project management principles. It would be nice if auditing students could also do the quires (even if without marks) to self-check and complete the course. Is is, I was unable to find a way to ""complete"" in a way that would move the course from enrolled to completed on my profile."
8467,I'm only on the first lecture but I already love this course and find it so enlightening. Thank you!
8468,"I really enjoyed this class a lot! Caught me a few things about designing a character, for sure"
8469,Good information course for states on bootstrap.
8470,"Very good! I don't understand the language, but the professor is fantastic and make it easy."
8471,Lots of good information.
8472,"Excellent course on negotiation skill, explained in a way which is easy to follow an practice."
8473,"Great course, it's better if you have some knowledge of advanced calculus and linear algebra. It's not required, but preferred."
8474,"Very great idea! His is the era of internet and communication and in this way I believe that you are making a great contribution to the educational equality. Is it is for this specific computer language (patron) as it is a free source program.Thanks, Mr Tea Fahami"
8475,It's the brilliant course. Any thanks to Andrew G.
8476,"His course is brilliant, with awesome (optional) coming problems to learn who to go from theory to practice! Thanks for these wonderful materials."
8477,very useful for amateur
8478,I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The lecturer (Have Underwood) has a relaxed and engaging style. He made it interesting and I felt I've learnt quite a bit in a short space of time. Recommend doing the optional exercises to practice what you learn as you go.
8479,Awesome experience. I would like to meet Or. Chuck personally someday :)
8480,Course content sometimes too boring
8481,"I'm learning so much.To excited to share this process and these principles in education, in business and my personal pursuits!!"
8482,"The video for this course seemed to be 30% reap of the prior lesson, and 20% restatement of what was learned. Some even duplicates their own content in the restatement. The material covered was simply running through each of the venus in Tableaux. Again, this material may be of use, but would be better as a prime for the class rather than presented as useful, paid content. Terribly disappointed."
8483,Killed in many gaps in my knowledge. I had a high school friend in An Francisco whose family was part of the Shanghai Jewish community during of 2 -- and I feel that I get his family better after taking this course. Thank you.
8484,"Good course. However It's only a stepsons for the specialization, it's essential to continue with the next courses if you really want to succeed in Social."
8485,His is an absolutely excellent course for those wanting a serious overview of neutral network. I would very highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in really going deep in the area.I would not however recommended this as an introductory machine learning class for someone unfamiliar with the area.
8486,I wish it was a bit more difficult. However I sure that the next class should be more difficult.
8487,Very well explained and progressive course. A very good introduction.
8488,Very simple video to understand complex ideas. Had a whole lot of fun watching them
8489,Great course for introducing web data to Python
8490,"Very helpful, at least, for me."
8491,helps u to learn in perfect way ....::::
8492,The course could be harder on us students to make some of us understand better and have a better practice.
8493,His is a great course to learn the fundamentals of Internet Network.
8494,"well detailed course, much needed for the topic"
8495,it is very information and interesting i really like the way you guide us thank you
8496,Had a great experience
8497,His was a simple and interesting course I would love it to be a little bit broader and present the information in more context. But still excellent course.
8498,Good content
8499,"In amazing course! Or Williams is a great and engaging lecturer, and the information is presented extremely well. Furthermore, the content is very interesting and adds aspect rarely touched in other courses on mental health, such as cultural aspects and effects of colonialism."
8500,"It doesn't just teach technique on effective learning but also explains how our mind works and how we process information. through this, we can understand ourselves and can think of which is more effective to us. It highlight things that we should avoid and the benefits of things that =can help to improve our mind. Understanding how our mind works gives confidence and takes our envy away fro geniuses."
8501,His course is a MUST if you have to learn a huge amount of information over long period of time. I was learning for a certificate and it took me 200+ hours over two months. His course showed me how to learn efficiently.
8502,this course is one of the best course
8503,Vice Continuation to Part-1
8504,"Amazing course! please offer more courses like this on fraud examination and forensic accounting. I would also be interested to take a course on Internal audit, Internal controls and yes management."
8505,"Money hungry, greedy! On't let us complete quires without paying! Shame!"
8506,Excellent course easy to understand and very practice evaluation
8507,Extraordinary course. Well done!
8508,Contributions of the professor in the discussions is wonderful
8509,Good introduction to big data. I would prefer that the hadoop lesson have more practical exercises;
8510,"The course is thorough and well-explained, but the tests' questions and answers are absurdly badly-designed so they become very difficult."
8511,Very education course presented in an exciting way! I never thought that learning theory might be so interesting.
8512,I loved it!
8513,His was my first online experience and I found it to be excellent and hope to complete many other courses -- what an excellent way to promote life long learning!
8514,Interesting and fun to learn
8515,Great refreshed
8516,"The course is extremely well organized. Theoretical part is presented in a comprehensible way. Mainstream views, their flaws and possible solutions are given, the author always mentions counteragruments and does not try to impose his personal thoughts. Individual tasks allow to get deeper into the studied cases. I also admire external invited participants of the lectures, as it provides more diverse perspective. And last, but not least, it`s great that the course evolved with current agenda.Thank You for this wonderful work!"
8517,Very good. Thank you
8518,It was excellent
8519,Great introduction course to Python!
8520,"Amazing course, I learnt a lot."
8521,"I learned a lot from the exercises in the other parts of the specialization. To make the capstone a better experience for everyone I propose that here the reviews should be grade. Perhaps, only have each person do two reviews instead of three but have them submitted as part of the next week's assignment and rate. Everyone could rate two or three reviews. His way reviews would put in as much effort into the reviews as into their submission, and they would also learn how to write reviews by reading other reviews and standing examples."
8522,"His educational and entertaining course ""pulled out all the stops""."
8523,"The course is interesting, and packed with some easy to understand, easy to apply technique. In the other hand, the real theory behind why these technique work is deliberately omitted from the video. His creates the feeling of a bit of esoteric knowledge, or, what it is worse, a feeling of trial and error technique, like the ones anybody can develop on his own... Also the total lack of exercises makes it a little bit boring to follow at times. Overall, a good experience.Quick note of speaking speed: I understand that reading slowly is best sometimes, but Prof. Valley is EXTREMELY slow, so much so, that I watched the video at 1.six and still felt like she was speaking at slightly slower speed than a normal person.."
8524,Well structures course with nice-to-know background information about hardware. The bonus material (interviews with some of the people who had great impact on programming) is fun to watch and shares the spirit of open source.
8525,"Prof. Emily Box is definitely enthusiastic, and gives clear explanations. The assignment add to the understanding of the material. While Graphlab, which is idiosyncratic is still used, explanations are given how to use Ici-It learn. A technical course, not only ideas - put also algorithms."
8526,"Of all the college courses I have ever taken, this is by far, my favorite, best one."
8527,"Air Charles Severance , You Lock !"
8528,A very good and useful explanation on how our brain work in learning.
8529,"In my point of view the course overall is a bit superficial (even though the decision-making part was very interesting indeed). More importantly, the course lacks one of the richest tools in MOOCS: peer interactions - people noticing their opinions and sharing experiences.Besides that: some of the questions in the quit looked very ambiguous and there are some editing mistakes in the video."
8530,"Hello,The overall content or education on English grammar was good. It made me to correct lot of things which I used to find difficult or project it wrong. Thank you for education me correctly. Appreciate your work."
8531,"His course will give you an edge whether you're learning a science class or history class...Also, it will give you a few tools to get to know you and how is your relationship with learning and studying, and make it better!"
8532,I really enjoyed the video and i get a good knowledge.
8533,His is an excellent introduction to the world of systematic reviews and met-analysis. I enjoyed the detailed information on every step of this research methodology.
8534,Great training using a terrific dataset. Learned some best practices and framework too.
8535,"Very nice course, easy to follow, interesting and with a lot of practical applications."
8536,Really interesting course. I could learn new things but also find out that most of the suggested approach to learn I am already using.
8537,A nice machine learning course without very advance topics.
8538,"Although the course doesn't seem to be practically used because we haven't found any of Life yet.I have learnt so much about Astrobiology. It also reminds me, an Aerospace Engineering student to prepare for the coming of aliens.\(^o^)/YES!\(^o^)/YES!"
8539,"I am running Firefox ve on Bunt Sinus ve.04. I was unable to watch any of the lecture video due to the page reading every 2 - 10 seconds. I tried moving to a different video with the same results. I don't know if this is of Davis-specific or whether Coursera has changed significantly since the last time I took a class, but this course is totally unable.I would have left this review with Coursera rather than as a course review, but Coursera doesn't make contact information easy to locate."
8540,"His was a great course! A variety of teaching style (lectures, guest experts, video, & reading), very well presented, & just fun. The ""this is what I do for my research"" bits add a personal touch, even the this is a MOOC. Nicely done."
8541,Prof. Harris does an excellent job of explaining the concepts of programming.
8542,"The course has a high quality. The teaching method is clear and easy to understand. Instructor also provide a lot of graph which are helpful. Though the course is easier than I expected, I still think it's a good course for students who want to know fundamental knowledge about cancer biology."
8543,"It's amazing, I've learnt so many things and I haven't even completed the course (yet)! Is it goes, it becomes more and more interesting, compelling to complete it and, maybe, even go for a certificate."
8544,Very clear for a beginner as I am
8545,By mistake wrote the wrong name for instructor. I wrote Or. Chuck instead of Or. Charles Severance. Please correct that in previous comment/review. Thanks
8546,The Trader Doesn't have test cases .Anyone can fool the grade easily
8547,In excellent introduction to Machine Learning! I thoroughly enjoyed the course material as well as the lectures.
8548,it is helpful and useful. I can learn something new about western Buddhist. Thanks!

8551,His course was really good for me. I was able to learn the basic theory and working of how services and content provides work in Android. His course helped me clot.
8552,I loved this course.
8553,The teacher is awesome: he explains coming in an extremely clear way with such useful examples. Totally recommended!
8554,"very interesting and helpful course , i really get a lot of knowledge and information during this coursebut if there exist a reference book it would be better"
8555,"Simple material, and nicely presented. Good choice for beginners"
8556,Great into. Thank you!
8557,"Run, interesting and well explained lectures"
8558,His Course really thought me how to expand my perspective on everything.
8559,Is per Oxford Dictionary:concise / adjectivegiving a lot of information clearly and in a few words; brief but comprehensiveThis course: really brief; not that clear nor well-structures; not nearly comprehensive.Is it at all possible to be both brief and comprehensive when teaching programming?
8560,Really good. It helped me to improve my learning skill and I have learned some new information about brain and how the learning is done.Need to practise and try all new methods but the video were great and funny.Thanks a lot.
8561,His course is great for me. I learned a lot of new things about machine learning.
8562,"It's an easy course, but good to get into more advance patron's stuff"
8563,I wish I had this course when was in high school.
8564,"Excellent introductory course. Simple, beautiful, well structures video, great articles and couture video. I would definitely recommend for beginners."
8565,A very nice class really helps a lot ！
8566,"Or. Chuck's Python sequence here on Coursera is a MUST TAKE for anyone interested in programming. In the second course, I found the content much more applicable to the kinds of data problem solving that I encounter in my work and understanding how to read files of data and turn those into unable data structures to manipulate the information found within is invaluable regardless of your profession.Deep up the great work and I am looking forward to taking more courses in this sequence!"
8567,"Excellent course that is precise, specific and unbiased."
8568,"Hello, thank you so much! His had helped me a lot in my patron! I don't know where I would end up without this class. :)"
8569,The course is awesome. Not too lengthy video with good explanation. The only drawback is the audit quality of some of the lectures.
8570,"fantastic course, learn a lot from it"
8571,It's a good course and has helped me understand time management better than the motivation books ever did.
8572,Very useful course for foreign English students. I appreciated your help.
8573,Final assignment is too difficult to do for beginners. It's crucial for them not to pass the course unless getting a certain score on the final assignment.
8574,Useful as a refreshing course to some of the data manipulation method in patron. Homework are written to apply the concepts covered in lecture. Some of the quit problems are really testing your understanding of a certain terms and aspects of patron programming
8575,"In excellent course that gives a solid introduction to the field of Machine Learning! Prof. Andrew is fantastic and inspiring, and he successfully manages to get us passionate about the subject; it's hard not to smile along with him at the end of each lecture!"
8576,"Fantastic course. There were complex concepts delivered in simple (but not patronizing) language, and some practical steps to take during your continued learning.Thank you very much for an entertaining and information course."
8577,"His is a must! Good tips and advice to gain health by the food you eat and the way you eat. Great teachers, short video, easy to follow."
8578,Very good introductory course. Vice little assignment to complete. By peers were suppurative and encouraging with their feedback. Would definitely recommend this course!
8579,"Of you want to be a web developer and have no knowledge of html and iss then you can start from this for sure, the basis are cleared in a very good way and the exercises are hard enough to he your brain for the exercises."
8580,"Excellent introductory course by a true master. Professor G managed to condensed the subject without losing too much depth. The discussions are always accompanied by ample examples and reflections from a practitioner's view. The programming exercises are especially valuable for finding relevance of the concepts to real-world applications, which are both fun and challenging. His course is a door-opened for people who want to explore the landscape but not wish to be put off by states"
8581,"A simple, yet effective course nonetheless can deliver a powerful impact."
8582,Pedagogical and to the point.
8583,"Excellent course, sorry that it is finishing."
8584,The most boring course ever. I just couldn't go beyond the first day
8585,It is very useful for someone with only basic finance knowledge
8586,"Very interesting, the subject is very well explained, inspiring..."
8587,Very basic overview using GraphLab Create to emphasize intuition - if you are familiar with of concepts might be a bit boring.
8588,Everything under one roof. His was really helpful for my job interview
8589,a nice introduction course for beginners。

8594,"Very practical, logical, and delivered in a very effective manner by Oris."
8595,His is an amazing course for anyone who wishes to dive into the front end development using Angular of framework. The course takes a dive into all important aspects and explains them in a very easy anatomical approach which is quite easy to understand and perceive.
8596,"Awesome class. It was very accessible and had some great examples. I would have liked to see a little more asked of the students. It would have been fun to implement some more examples that required the full of tool box (cross variation, training). I was a little surprised that there were no discussion / examples of tree classified or Naive Hayes. It would have been helpful to have a discussion on how to handle categorical features."
8597,"MUY COMPLETO Y FACIL of ENTENDER of QUE MANEJA of LENGUAJE COLOQUIAL.of of INTERESA SABER QUE PASA CON LOS RESIDUOS LUEGO QUE SALEN of of HOGAR, Y COMO SACARLE PROVECHO A ESTOS ESTE CURSO of EXPLICA TODO"
8598,"I truly have learned a lot, especially understanding more about my strength and weaknesses"
8599,Very interesting course. It will help you become a better student which can come in handy if you're planning on taking more MOOCs.
8600,I think this is a great introduction to object tormented programming that Cava uses. I have some background in Cava already and can see the parallels this course brings
8601,His feels more a like a sales pitch for Copyblogger than an actual course. Mind feels like a waste of my time. I didn't learn anything new.
8602,Had no pre knowledge for languages. Coursera is preparing me for the cutting edge world.
8603,Very well structures
8604,"Its a concise and meaningful course, will provide better shape to thoughts of a potential researcher to understand framework of designing one's own research. It will definitely gives broader insight on step by step planning and management skill too."
8605,"Clear, concise instruction. Easy-to-follow examples. Highly recommended."
8606,I really enjoyed the comparison of what is ideal vs. what actually happens when it comes to data science. His was a very practical course and gave insight into what to expect from data science and analysis.
8607,Learnt a lot of algorithms and statistics.
8608,great course for those interested in machine learning
8609,"Awesome projects, taught by odersky himself"
8610,A very decent prime for everyone new to programming or dusty on a different language.
8611,the last lecture was too fast. Would be good to divide this into two parts. West all is great stuff.
8612,Very well-organized! It is my favorite course! :)
8613,"The approach in this course is incorrect, I think that will be a course with more concert examples, but is a course with a lot of theory that is not applied."
8614,"Well-organized R programming course for academic amateur with some OOP knowledge before! By simply using Gun, th is class focused on technique in ABC's of R programming including not limited to basic objects, data structure, controlling sentences, I/O and debugging suggestions.Personally, I take this course for job purpose, but this course falls short for industrial technique, such as reading/outputting expel, sophisticated operation on data frame, or combining R with Python and SQL.Hope that this comment will be useful to you."
8615,Quite good but kind of too theoretical. Some practical examples would make the contents more understandable
8616,"The rate is excellent. Or. Chuck is very detailed and thorough. The first PYTHON course was the ""Python for Everybody"" which was fantastic. I needed to review data structures and file handling and this course is right on target for me. Thank you so much for your efforts and education, Or. Chuck. (Six Stars)"
8617,"Easy to understand, video are fun to watch. Learning patron was easy."
8618,"Good, but it is better to give more exercises"
8619,"Great introduction! I really feel like I learned a lot and am looking forward to going through with the rest of the courses in this specialization. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the peer-reviewed assignment. I felt I didn't really get enough peer feedback. Other than that, I thought everything else was great. The video were very information. It didn't take up a lot of my free time and I felt a sense of accomplishment when the course was completed."
8620,"His course has little or no information, not at all what was advertised, too much peer stuff"
8621,An not be more clear about the function of list and duct in patron.
8622,"really helpful course, through which we can understand how our brains works when learning. also it reaches some learning technique when we learn some new things."
8623,"I think it's a great effort for presenting us all this research, video, activities, etc. but sometimes is heavy, boring, long, I think you could resume de course, so we don't loss interest. Thanks a lot anyway!"
8624,I am studying to be a teacher and I found every single word useful and clear. Thus concepts are well explained. Thank you for this course
8625,Interesting content but explanations are less clear with respect to the other courses of the of Specialization
8626,In excellent though-provoking introduction to several branches of Philosophy. You can tell the instructor love what they do - it makes it easy to love it too.
8627,"Great teacher, good material. It's awesome for those who want to become familiar with calculus."
8628,"Informative, engaging, high production value. I give it a hell yeah."
8629,"To a great course, and the teacher shared his knowledge"
8630,"Fascinating thoughtful look into Chinese interactions.Excellent peer assessment if you pay attention to what is told you about the focus.Only drawback, for me, was no downloadable txt [when took course]."
8631,Definitely the programme I have been searching for
8632,"His course is perfect for gaining a broad perspective on global energy markets. It also delivers useful tools for analyzing political issues, strategic business decisions, and energy markets."
8633,"Thank you so much for the course!I liked the research project, it game me a lot of interesting knowledge. I thought in the beginning it is pretty easy course but the last assignment took me a while."
8634,To much material! The presentations are engaging and well-paced. The presented showed an appropriate level of candor about the behavior of both respondent and interviews.
8635,i like this course it gives me opportunity to know many things about how my brain works
8636,Outstanding Theoretical concepts were explained clearly. Examples and numerical questions beautifully supplemented the theory into practical use. They were neither too difficult nor too easy- a perfect balance.
8637,Wonderful arrangement for learning.
8638,"Great course. Take sure you plan time to do all of the optional exercises, they are great."
8639,Run. And interesting as well.
8640,"A very good coverage on creating interactive charts using various facilities such as slowly, goose vis, and the shiny pp framework. The knowledge is very practical to be used immediately for my day-to-day work."
8641,"Good content, excellent teacher."
8642,Great course for all those who want to get started with essay writing.
8643,Well thought out course. I learned a lot.Some of the supplemented materials were extremely dense with professor-speak. I found my learning ground to a slow crawl from having to look up as many a 5 words in some sentences and I have a Masters Degree.In reading some of my peers essay submission it seems that others may have had a similar difficulty with the material.
8644,it was a good course
8645,Great class with good case studies. Uric is great teacher
8646,I do not want to pay for quires while learning.
8647,Very good for students with little to no programming background. Experienced programme will find it easy to learn when diving into programming with Python
8648,Fantastic course for those interested in safety and quality of healthcare
8649,Very American should understand this problem. It should especially be taught in our high schools.
8650,"Excellent course! Lectures are comprehensive and concise, and the lectures explained the topics well. Quizzes and peer review exam test our understanding of the nodules well, and I appreciate the book recommendations."
8651,"I've always been interested in web design and this course was really helpful and now I know the basis of HTML, CSS and JavaScript."
8652,"Good course. It will help both managers as well as direct reports to find a common interface for better communication, and more efficient business relationships."
8653,"Run, quick and easy course that had useful information for beginners and those with more experience alike. On't expect to learn a lot about the physiology and chemical science of food, but has some great useful information for anyone looking to make wealthier choice in their everyday li"
8654,"A very interesting and well-prepared course. I am sure it will be very useful for me in the future (in fact - it is very useful already, as I started using some of the mechanics already while learning a foreign language). Really worth recommending!"
8655,"His is an extraordinary course. I'm currently enrolled in school to become a Veterinary Assistant, and this course (along with Brian Are & Vanessa Goods' ""The Genius of Dogs,"" has been a wonderful learning experience. I definitely recommend this for anyone working with dogs and dog owners. Cheers."
8656,Very Informative. Have to devote quite a bit of time to it though.
8657,His course is quite elaborate and the course content and lectures are quite effective.
8658,"A bit hard in my opinion, but wonderful content and teaching so far."
8659,"The course is easy to listen and comprehend, and all material is pretty practical. However, it is rather superficial. I myself maintain a healthy lifestyle, and I didn't learn almost anything new from it (i'd say, around 5% of the information was new to me). I expected more. In the other hand, it's a good course for people with weight&lifestyle problems to figure out first steps towards a wealthier lifestyle."
8660,Great material to get you started with machine learning. Covers a bit of different ideas used in machine learning. It definitely got me eager to learn more in the following courses!
8661,Or. chuck provides one of the best study experience. every one should undertake this course
8662,"It was a great course that reaches you how to eat, how to cook and how to eat well. I've been always interested in the relation between food and life, and this helps me to have deeper interested in the subject."
8663,Vice course but so easy .
8664,Well balanced course with easy comprehension.
8665,I really recommend this course. Oh authors give good range of information and structure it in the way it helps you to understand how to implement the knowledge in youreveryday job. They provide the data research and surveys that confirms the information. The new information is good illustrated with the real business examples.
8666,The gives a deeper understanding of managing diversity and inclusion
8667,"Really good course for beginners.Allows for some experimentation, while giving students the basis."
8668,It's very worth taking.
8669,"The content of the course is alright and up to date. The instructor are also good, passionate and has a great knowledge.That brings everything down is the video editing and the slide design/quality. They are terrible and clearly not in the field of profession of the creator.All in all, it is an average course, but I can recommend it to anyone interesting in the topic, because it does its job. Of someone could improve the sides and the video editing could reach the couture video reviewed/critic level, it could easily do a 4 out of 5."
8670,Great hands-on course with exhaustive and self sufficient material
8671,Very useful course as an introduction to animal welfare!
8672,Exceptional course! I learned so much in such a little span of time. :) Would recommend it to everyone.
8673,"The lectures are short and traumatic, addressing the most relevant points of interest of an average person towards nutrition. Almost every of these lectures provide simple and double advice to implement it right away, while all the information is research-based. Assessment allow you to strengthen your insight upon the information given through precise and thorough feed-back."
8674,"well organized, user friendly, brief but information, based on video (nevertheless, a transcription is always provided), if you are fond of metaphor you will definitely enjoy it. you have a choice to prepare a video clip (if you prefer the spoken language) or an essay (if you prefer the written language) for each assignment"
8675,the instructor is very motivation in the way she presents the material. The really made me enjoy the course!
8676,Good for complete beginners.
8677,It was really helpful.
8678,"Great course for any professional who wants to learn more about direct taxation and tax planning. Subjects like BEPS, of State aid etc. are covered at length! Definitely recommended!Maybe just some small points of criticism: the assignment are not very clear, the time shown you need for the course and for the reading is not accurate, prepare for more if you wish to really get something out of the course."
8679,West teachers ever! Content is suitable for both beginners and those who already have some experience in coming. I really enjoyed the lectures as well as the programming assignment.
8680,"His course has been an eye opened for me, I truly enjoyed it. It gives you basic knowledge of what it takes to be a good public speaker, and you can apply this knowledge not only in presentations, but also in your daily life. The most difficult part for me was to make the video and watch myself, but it really helps in your improvement. Also, the feedback of your classmates makes you see things you haven't caught. Cry it out, you won't regret it."
8681,really good into
8682,"Excellent course on Front-And JavaScript Framework. Covers a wide range of web development topics and tools that can easily overwhelm first-time takes. Professor Jogesh is a great instructor who knows his stuff and explains everything thoroughly. Students may have to take this class twice to really soak in the material, and this is just the front-end side of web development!"
8683,Very Very good course to learn in effective and efficient manner.............
8684,"In excellent way to finish off the specialisation. There were a couple of kinds but as I was in the first class to complete this, these weren't material and didn't hinder my progress. On't underestimate the time it takes to complete the project to a satisfactory level, the courses leading up to this took a lot of time and this is no different. Writing a complete business plan and also reviewing others are new skill that I believe will serve my career well. A great prime for an MBA and it really gave me confidence in the University of London as an institution."
8685,Standardized material for study.
8686,it's really useful !!!!
8687,Great opening course for new machine earners!
8688,Excellent Course for a beginner.Looking forward to more classes by the same instructor and support groups. Thanks!
8689,"For sure, I am not the only one rating this course with 5 stars, I really learned a lot of new and useful things, regarding linear repression, supervised/supervised learning, bias/variance, neutral network (my initial motivation), SVM, etc. In fact many new things.There are minor aspects to improve (e.g. the need to apply patches in every assignment in order to submit my works, some wrong translations in spanish, etc).Thanks for everything"
8690,"Vice course with broad overview, appropriate to wide audience concern to warfare, politics, defense and security. Also, literature is very interesting and suggested books have reasonable price. Topics of discussions are inspiring and ingratiating. Reaching style is relaxed, well pointed and very interesting."
8691,Very useful course to learn the basis of project management
8692,Valuable and not too time consuming.
8693,Great introduction to strategy.
8694,"His course is wonderfully and engaging taught by the great Geoffrey Each, with a lot of food for thought, excellent visual aids, relevant data and statistics, and supplementary reading which add a lot to the course. The quires not only test the knowledge found in the lectures, but ask the students to analyze other data from sources such as the of and World Bank. Overall, a politic and information-packed introduction to the field of sustainable development."
8695,"Additional Programming concepts, and solidified programming skill in Cava."
8696,"Excellent beginner course for learning Python. The instructor slowly guides your thinking so that your thought process matches that of a Python programme. Quizzes and especially assignment are relevant to testing your newly acquired skill. Of you have a bit of experience in other languages, I recommend going quickly through the course, as I found a great deal of overlap in language that let me speed ahead."
8697,I am really thankful to Coursera.org and University of Pensyllvania for providing me education in robotics. Its going to be a great experience studying with really great professors.
8698,"Great course, great teacher. Thank you"
8699,"Of you have Oracle installed from previous classes, there is very little set required. Of not, give yourself ample time to install/configure it. Assignment take MUCH longer than the quoted 30 minutes."
8700,West Course on of yet on the Web
8701,"Absolutely brilliant course and Prof. Shapiro really helps me understand important aspects of politics, morality and influential ideologies from first principles. Thanks from Australia!"
8702,Excellent training!
8703,Join the winning team were all is happening. Great Course.
8704,Thanks for having this useful tips and information available for all of English earners. I was looking for this specific course until I met a Russian teacher who has recommend . I Hope I can attend as many other courses from this University as I can
8705,Vice explanations. Examples and presentation are very easy to understand.Congratulations!!!
8706,Excellent course for beginners.
8707,"The course itself is well put together and contains the perfect amount of challenge for students who have completed the previous Duke Cava courses. I have come to enjoy the odd quickness of the instructor and their video, as they seem to embrace the fact that they must remain a bit silly in order to effectively engage students in this format."
8708,His is just what I looking for. It is very insightful and encouraging.
8709,Amazing! Great teacher and very interesting.
8710,"Interesting, excellent material"
8711,"Is a fan of History, I highly recommend this MOOC, it is always good for you to see history from a different prospective."
8712,"Very good course. Well explained, the professor makes it very easy to understand and gives very good material. I liked the programming assignment, best way to learn and apply the new skill following small steps."
8713,Good Course to understand the basis of Internet Network.
8714,Extremely good.
8715,this is one of the most enjoyable courses i have ever attended !
8716,A very very good course. The tasks can be a bit demanding but definitely what is needed and worth it to learn not only Scala but functional programming as well
8717,information and helped with our course learning
8718,Perfect for me!
8719,"I personally fond of this first-time encounter with Project Management on Coursera. The course is not too distressful for the beginner as myself; however, I could grab many basic things from this course to have more confident! It least, I know something about management :) Thanks!"
8720,Andrew is fantastic!
8721,Great Instructor and a nice way to teach us. Liked every single lecture. Enjoyed the project too.
8722,"Great course, great teacher, great detailed explanations. I wish the video material was of professional quality. 5 stars for contents, 4 stars for effort."
8723,"Prof. G is a kind and humble teacher, and that encouraged me to complete the course. I respect his knowledge and experience, but his personal attitude was essential to motivate me through to the end. I started my of studies on other online sources, but none have made me so interested as this course. Congratulations and thanks, Prof. G!"
8724,very interesting course. I learned a lot of information. Professor explaining really good Rhinosinusitis topic!
8725,Difficult but a challenging course
8726,"Complete course, the only thing i change would be the narrator"
8727,"Really nice step forward from the basic Peter course. I love the way the teacher explains the concepts, and how he build meaningful examples"
8728,Great course and great professors. Very interesting knowledge base to learn from.
8729,"Thanks very much Red! I really liked the content of your course, it really made me aware of how important it is to be a leader in the Health Are Environment, and how important it is to build quality with all the participants, including the patient."
8730,The course is so interesting and helpful! Thank you for new ideas and inspiration!
8731,"Very interesting overview of the energy business. I would encourage Michael Orlando to release other more specialized courses on hot topics such as the leveled cost of generation resources, electricity or natural gas market dynamic,...I would thank you Michael Orlando for his time and effort to make this course available to all of those interested in energy matters.Antonio"
8732,"I think this course does not a good job of explaining the mathematics very well. The supplementary material is very good in that regard, compared to the lectures. However, there are too few to make up for it. I would need a few example calculations of similar problems to what we are expected to solve in the exercises.Is a result, my learning success is not very satisfactory."
8733,"Excellent course, explained in a very fun way, CONGRATULATIONS !!!"
8734,Great tour of functional programming features. Only slight improvement I would suggest is to give some more practice making functions tail-repulsive.
8735,"His course is a must for anyone trying to strive in a business. Independently of the field and industry, the lessons learned through this course are applicable in the short run to your own journey. I took it as part of the goals we at my company set out to do after our first ""Growth thrust"" and the stories and learning from this course will definitely help us ""Grow Smarter"".I am not a native English speaker and the content was perfectly suited for me. Great work Garden School of Business!Otto AcunaSan Most, Costa Rich."
8736,"Very pleasant look into not only how Objective-C works, but also why it was built the way it was. I enjoyed that."
8737,His is an awesome course which provides different technique of sanitation and to access it. It focused about the technology and treatment facility . These technique must be adopted for better and healthy environment.
8738,Not of considerably complex and dry (accounting and statistics!) subject matter covered at a high level without much discussion! Ruin questions are unnecessarily complex - which (IMHO) will discourage / turn off those who are new to this subject matter in completing this course. The last week is pretty interesting though!I am taking the full business analysis course - and find that the quality and complexity of content is all over the place!! Some are way too simple and some are highly complex.
8739,The course is very interesting and challenging but there are mistakes in the video and too much mathematical theory with relation to examples.
8740,One of the best course on course . Moved it . I am glad that I took this course and will definitely recommend to others . Thanks to course team especially professor A . Thank you so much for changing our attitude towards life .
8741,Did not want to take this course for credit. Basically watched all of the video.Round it very interesting and information.
8742,Interesting assignment.Good lectures
8743,His course is well designed with very good coverage of technical details of various aspects of web development. The exercises and assignment are quite inspiring. I would strongly recommend this course to those want to learn wen development and don't have much experience yet.
8744,A very useful course .
8745,Content was easy to follow and the tutors delivered material appropriately
8746,Thoroughly enjoyable and valuable course.
8747,"A very good course! It the beginning it might look simple, but gets challenging after the first two weeks."
8748,Very good and easy understand
8749,"The course is quite nice, but actually I was expecting something more design / i related and less code.The name of the course and description is a bit misleading."
8750,"it's helpful but not interactive a lot, sometimes hard to follow the video but the professor is quite knowledge about the history, gives a lot of insight and force you to re-assess the course after it finished , by na"
8751,"A fantastic course by Andrew G. I would like to congratulate him for putting up this course. The course content, structure, flow, examples, assignment were amazing."
8752,By background is in baths and computer sciences but I had no notion of machine learning. I found this course to be an very interesting introduction to the topic. The assignment are good and the teacher is super inspiring. I absolutely recommend this course.
8753,Easy to learn. Good for beginners.
8754,It is super essential course. I firmly wish everyone should learn this lesson and get vital learning technique.
8755,"A phenomena, deliberately shallow introduction to Machine Learning. His course definitely cannot standalone but serves as a great start to the specialization.There was a great deal of sensitivity in the course due to the use of Dato Graphlab, particularly since one of the instructor is the CEO of Dato and the software is not free for commercial use. His was exacerbated because the color scheme of the presentation sides matches the color scheme of the Dato webster.However putting this aside the material is very high quality. The use of case studies is inspired and helps students focus on when to use particular of technique. Although the material is a little shallow (deliberately) you get a good high-level feel for what technique are applicable in specific situations. However the course can't really standalone, and it's intended as part of the specialization."
8756,Great course. Great perspective to understand media
8757,I think this course is pretty good
8758,"A great overview - somewhat basic if you already have some quantitative background, but it introduces the concepts and methods really well."
8759,Very very well built and explained. Great Mob!
8760,Really enjoyed this course. Learned a great deal about ways to effectively make change locally and locally. Also learned a great deal about past failures. The reading were extensive but outstanding.
8761,"Good, if basic, into to framework and tools."
8762,"His course is amazingly interesting and presented in a clear, achievable way. HUGE THANKS to the professors!"
8763,His is most amazing course that I have taken in my life. It has answers to many of questions that been struggling inside my brain for years.
8764,Great course
8765,"I absolutely loved this course, it a wonderful foundation for the rest of the course"
8766,His is a very good course! any thanks to professor Lagerstrom.
8767,It's so smile concept for student who want to learn C language.I suggest this lesson.
8768,"After digging around in the MOOC world for a bit in search of a more current course, I came to the conclusion that this course is still the best. Reasons are it offers a solid theoretical foundation, and it doesn't use all the built-in libraries when it comes to implementing the core concepts. I feel confident that I can now tackle a more current course with a better idea of what goes on behind the hood. A truly great course!"
8769,"Sides are poorly done and leave a lot of useful details out. There is zero support from staff in the forms. Of you take this course, plan on spending a lot of time doing research on external sources in order to gain an understanding of the very broad and lacking in detail video.To improve this course, the instructor should:-provide links to at least one textbook on Swift-add Senators to the course to help students in the forms-include a depositors of code shippers for practice of the concepts"
8770,"Not a beginner course. You need an engineering background to know how to interpret the equations enough to finish the coming assignment in Atlas. Some of the equations presented don't have enough explanation behind them for them to seem in context or to give any idea about how they can be applied.I have a background in electrical engineering, and I studied control systems in undergrad, so I was able to get by. Of you can't manage through this course, don't feel like you aren't smart enough to complete it; rather, you just don't have the proper pre-requisite."
8771,Very nice course I learned new things. Thanks for the Coursera team and community.
8772,Very Good Course for engineers
8773,The Course was fantastic - thank you Or. Chuck and Staff!!!
8774,His is great course. I am really grateful toAndrew G for this amazing course.
8775,Excellent!! Focus on the fundamentals really helped in developing deeper understanding of the of!!
8776,Great Course as usual but the last two assignment kind of looked a bit hard but not really....Thank you to proof Charles
8777,Very interesting.Enjoyed every minute.
8778,His course has been a great opportunity to improve my learning skill. I appreciate the given opportunity and look forward for ne sources from this team. Thanks a lot!
8779,very useful information and very helpful for technical review
8780,The course is well structures and clarity of teaching is impressive. The assignment have a good mix of easy and progressively rougher questions that build on the syllabus and challenge you to manipulate data in your own way. I can warmly recommend this course to anyone who wants to begin manipulation and analyzing data using patron.
8781,Nicely started but bit hurried up at the end
8782,Mind = Blown
8783,The lectures are short and to the point. I believe this helps the students to stay focused and not get tired. The teacher explains the material very well. The only thing I do not like is that the quires are only for the students who paid for the course.
8784,Perfect Course for my language skill and job-seeking knowledge
8785,so easy
8786,Very good and helpful introduction to Of Printing
8787,His course is really helpful to improve my research writing.
8788,Translation from English only on the first sides. I thought it at all lectures. Spent a lot of time beginning to study.
8789,I've know many skill in competition with many true cases. Thanks!
8790,A complete guide to the project management risks and planning phase. Key is to implement the learning to real life.
8791,Excellent course. I would recommend this course for everyone who are interested and don't have the opportunity at their institute.
8792,Suggest to have more interactive Sides than lengthy Headings
8793,His is a great course to introduce anyone interested in music production. I would recommend this course to any and everyone. Thank you Berklee and Grin! An you tell I enjoyed this.And the Seats continue.Hosanna -JKM
8794,I'm blown away by the content of this course and what I've learned. I took a strategy class before but the content in this one is so clear and well explained.
8795,think
8796,"Wonderful course, lots of information. Or. Vienna is an excellent teacher. Thanks also to his staff and lab assistants for helping to create such a well-designed program. I will definitely recommend this course to others!"
8797,Great course! Right level of complexity for people who have knowledge of programming.
8798,His course so awesome!
8799,Great course!
8800,"I like the course very much! The music covered in the course is really beautiful.The professor reaches us how to appreciate a piece of music step by step. Before taking this course, I just knew the music is great! I like it! After taking the course I can listen to the music in a more scientific way.I really want to say thank you to the professor."
8801,Excellent presentations with engaging graphics. Worthy of time and thought
8802,"Any video lacked associated of sides so confusing to watch. Some topics on sides were not covered in video. A supplemented video for those would be great even of optional.Brian Dato is a good presented, however, more examples needed to be done showing how to work out various statistical problems both by traditional method and using R."
8803,it is a very good course for beginner.
8804,"The course has bags, but it shouldn't distract from gaining knowledge. The 5 star given due to comprehensive tools used and final assignment preparation."
8805,It is really helpful for those who are willing to learn.
8806,"I am already mouthwatering on what I will learn from this course. After watching the review, I am confident on the quality of this course."
8807,Excellent if you have zero starting knowledge of Python. Even a basic understanding will make some of the video feel like they're too long. Excellent instructor makes course worth taking despite this.
8808,Short and Apt classes. Great amount of information shared in each class.
8809,Very detailed and a nicely structures program. Lectures were surprisingly precise!
8810,very good course. And trainer are expert in their field. Thankyou. very nice experience
8811,A very interesting course. Obviously the faculty are well versed in the field. Would have been much nicer to have informaticists from other areas participating instead of all from the nursing field.More on data visualization would have been great!
8812,Thank you very much!!!
8813,Really helpful and good one...
8814,Very comprehensive and useful!
8815,Interesting and very useful course.
8816,Excellent course to start programming with Python.
8817,great course with excellent teacher and very effortful video! Really enjoyed it and learned a lot
8818,Amazing course! Thanks for making this possible.
8819,His course was really very well organized and comprehensive in its content. The lectures are excellent expertise on the topic and they are very engaging. It is an absolute deal to take this course for those who are looking to advance their career in the area of subsurface pollutant mediation and research.ThanksWorku J Negawo
8820,Very interesting and pleasant to follow.
8821,"Very good hands-on approach to practical machine learning. However, as the models get more complicated, some of the material isn't really explained very well, specially the last module about 'deep learning' is quite superfluous. I also wish, the course favored providing a bit more mathematical intuition over just graphlab usage. All things aside, if you are really curious about machine learning you should take this course. He hungry!"
8822,Vice introduction into Responsive Web Development. Thanks!
8823,"His course is not well moderate, the material is confusing, and the quires were not tested before unloading them onto Coursera. His specialization is definitely not on par with other specializations I have done.BLUF: There are better uses for your money and time."
8824,"His is an essential lesson to start learning programming language concepts. An Grossman has created a great learning path. All the video are of high quality explaining in detail concepts that each developer should be aware of. The material given was nicely organized with a lot of examples. I cannot recommend this course more highly!of: The course uses SML, a functional language. Of it's your first time working with that paradise do not hesitate. SML is quite simple and it will open a new world for you!"
8825,It is very useful for the people who begin to learn machine learning !
8826,"can't wait to rate this course! I hope I could give 1 start but to show respect I rate it 2. It's just because I personally don't like the instructor and the way he talks, which could ruin the course! I truly hope we could have another instructor in the following courses or the whole specialization would be ruined and so would my interest in database."
8827,It was a great learning experience for me. The teachers instructions were clear and concise. I enjoyed this course
8828,I really liked the way it was taught. I could skin through the areas I was competent. Helped me fill the gaps. I strongly recommend this course.
8829,Fairly straightforward course. Would go into more depth for each topic.
8830,Algorithms in lectures were useless to programming assignment
8831,"Is a frenchman here, machine learning given by Andrew G is an ideal course to start with. It's not very difficult on path, if you have had a quick look on Linear Algebra and Calculus."
8832,It was very hard for me to learn I am not good at javascript
8833,Very practical course! Learned a lot.
8834,"awesome course,loved it!!!"
8835,"Love it, easy to follow, great lecture. !"
8836,"His is an amazing course. The teacher (Chris) is fantastic, extremely clear and a pleasure to listen his classes."

8838,Very interesting and full of ideas to negotiation
8839,"Very good material, excellent teachers and video. Vice people and nice tests."
8840,"wonderful course, it got me familiar with financial concepts.the instructor is very much appreciated."
8841,It gave me some new insight in how to work smarter.
8842,I've learn powerful information about how to learn! It was very empowering and helpful
8843,Great course!!!
8844,More than excellent
8845,A good course. Although within this University of Michigan specialization there are ones that I found more captivating so check out the whole specialization.
8846,Very good and useful course!!!!
8847,thank you!! It was a really different and special experiment for me to try learning chinese
8848,Superb Course great learning
8849,"Excellent course with very suppurative staff and professors on the forum. In top of that aligning the assignment to ""The Romance of Three Kingdoms"" story makes it fun to follow along."
8850,His course is basically about watching inspiring video. It needs a lot of design thinking itself.I have bought the book however. It is really useful.
8851,Good Knowledge
8852,A very nice course for people who are careless about mountains. It made me appreciate them more than before.
8853,"I enjoyed the course a lot. I cannot thank the instructor enough.It would have been more interesting if we could go deeper on linear programming, such as extension to inter programming. The discussion about the quality was a bit too fast to me."
8854,Phenomena Course!
8855,Good quality information. I recommend to pay attention at the optional parts as well!
8856,"First: University of Pennsylvania and we still have to deal with a heavy accent?Second: Wouldn't tell if all the vocal gone over repeatedly was standard or made up by the prof.Third: Tilted, repetition and boring teaching style."
8857,"Very nice course, is very friendly and reaches you efficiently. Totally worth it, although a few more exercises would have been great."
8858,Awesome class! Detailed explanation. Interesting assignment. Fool instructor. Thanks for the course course. :)
8859,"In mix of general tips on how to write well mixed with some corporate-specific information. Road overview, but I didn't really learn anything."
8860,"Nodules are easy to understand and logical taught, lectures have an understanding of teaching and teaching material which in itself is necessary! Well spoken and articulate."
8861,"Awesome...I have no other words, the course has gotten better as it has gone on and I didn't think that was possible. The professor's and Coursera's staff took consideration into the earners opinions and made the necessary changes that have refined this course to the maximum."
8862,In excellent course full of insight and masterfully delivered by a clear expert in this
8863,It is a very complete overview. It is very helpful for reviewing English grammar and punctuation. The additional resources are also very good.
8864,Excellent course. An explains crept from the ground up making it easy to understand more advanced construction as the weeks advance.
8865,It really opens your mind and gives you a better understanding of a very complex topic that is doing
8866,I started this course from scratch without knowing any idea of programming.A series of well-designed lectures held me to keep moving forward step by step.I really appreciate Or.Chuck.Have fund with this course!
8867,really cool
8868,"Is a software engineer, materials related to social medial and its privacy issues are not new at all. However, basic principals and practices on the personal branding are very helpful. I am still searching for my board of directors. His course makes me change how I live as a professional."
8869,"Excellent instructor and the material is life changing, I think everyone should take this course!"
8870,Awesome courseThanks for course
8871,"Great speaker, great explanations, nice jokes. Pleasure to watch and learn"
8872,"His is a good course in theoretical machines learning but not much integrated with big data amputation work. Of you have other course related to machines learning with big data, definitely, I must participate it in future. Thanks for your teaching. Excellent Course !!!!"
8873,Great course for me.Now I use Angular in my current work project.Thanks!
8874,Really good. Thanks for the course.
8875,"Superb. His is the first MOOC I managed to finish, and now I'm actively exploring all the extra resources and video from the course.I originally enrolled looking for tips on how to make my courses more accessible for my students (I'm a college instructor), and also to help me one my learning skill, since I'm starting to delve on different fields of study. Not only did I achieve those goals, but I'm also very excited to explore new MOOCs and online study possibilities.The only downside, if one could say such, is that this course sets quite a high bar in how a MOOC should be: one can easily perceive that everything about its format -- from the weekly newsletter to the video' length and visual to the structure and syllabus -- is made with careful consideration of the context of online learning, and of the fundamentals of neuroscience the course shares with the students. Any (good!) MOOCs aren't as well tailor as this one.I absolutely recommend it to anyone who is interested (even if frustrated!) with learning, be it independently, online or in a traditional classroom environment. Congratulations and warm thank you to Or. Valley, Or. Sejnowski, and the Learning Now to Learn Team!"
8876,Really good course.
8877,"Good course, interactive, fun, a bit of hand-holding at times but that's to be expected. Overall 8.5/10"
8878,"The lectures were good but when it came to quires and assignment, we do not know what to do? The questions were very complicated and not stated in the Lectures"
8879,"The course is well-designed, covering from basis to applications. The lecture notes are clear and the difficulty levels of the assignment are acceptable. The instructor is very nice! You can learn machine learning step by step by going through this course."
8880,"Of more than five stars can be given to this course, I would rather give. I rarely write reviews but this course enforce me to do so. His is one of the easy to understand courses. The vocabulary is simple and the way of introducing the subjects is smooth. The professor is very humble and try to explain the concepts is a very direct and simple way."
8881,i liked these course so much
8882,His class is tough and time flies. To more into stuff. His is is where we really start to get into some heavy programming (at least for my endurance level)
8883,I like this course very much. It's so amazing
8884,"Good course overall, wish more topics were covered but it's of."
8885,Excellent course - covers many strategics on how to negotiate as well as providing insight into the negotiation process.
8886,Outstanding course. I had been meditating for a year prior to taking this course and was just beginning to see the long-term benefits of the practice. I am not a spiritual person. By interest in religion goes only as far as it's impact on culture and society. I have been pursuing Buddhist philosophy and practice to the extent that it has shown substantive scientific benefits. I was really getting interested in the intersecting links between Buddhist thought and practice and the underlying science behind the results when this course came along. It was everything I hoped it would be. The material was relevant and thought - provoking and Professor Right did an amazing job with its presentation.
8887,Great class as always. Thanks Or. Chuck!
8888,"His was a wonderfully developed overview of music therapy. The instructor were knowledgeable and their interviews engaging to watch. The plethoric of information between the video, writings and articles were second to none. Well done! Clearly a lot of effort on the part of the instructor. By only difficulty was that for the final assignment, I had so many things running through my head that I had to narrow down and focus what I wanted to present. I could have written a dozen different scenario with all the information I gathered from this course. It was well worth my time and money for the certificate. I would love to take a followed course."
8889,"very interesting course, with a tricky questions sometimes, but with ones that makes you think carefully. Very interesting interview video. Thanks!"
8890,Learnt a lot !
8891,Such an amazing professor teaching a very comprehensive course. Highly recommended. Thank you!
8892,Great course for a shallow introduction to R programming.
8893,Interesting course which helps you to improve your learning skill. I highly recommend reading the suggested book by Professor Valley parallel to this course!
8894,"Very well presented and thorough investigation into spectrogram, STFT and reconstruction technique. Enjoying thanks."
8895,nice chemical course for beginners
8896,"The course is excellent and the professor Hardly Lava´s lessons are pretty interesting and interactive. Besides, the tools he share are the best in the market. Thanks Northwestern University for the opportunity."
8897,"First four weeks of the course were awesome,some exciting problems,insightful teaching but fifth week's content I felt were not up to the standards of first four weeks.Nonetheless it was great experience.Thank you instructor and course forum."
8898,"The early lectures were profoundly dense, monotony and fluttered with non-conceptual detail while being (strangely given the subject) seemingly empty of a real desire to share, or convey, understanding. I am confess that, as much as I was looking forward to guest lectures, I couldn't make it past the first three."
8899,I am having a really good experience. The classes are very easy to understand and the quires help me fix the knowledge. I highly recommend this course for people who want to learn the first words in Chinese.
8900,"I love the scale-up part of the course. It gives me a great insight of upscaling of solar cells. But in general, the course is lack of content in depth. I would prefer a more hard core course with detailed explanation of the working mechanism of solar cells."
8901,Very little new and does not include more complex sensitivity analysis for corporate valuation
8902,I found this course very helpful and useful. I would add only one thing: more graduated exercises.Thank you for it.
8903,Vice course with very good lectures
8904,"The Age of Sustainable Development is by far the most information course I have encountered on the complex and permanent subject of sustainable development. Professor Each takes the time to fully explore many of the key themes that form the foundations of sustainable development and simplifies sophisticated topics into digestive pieces of insight. His course is a must for anyone involved in sustainable development and should be prescribed viewing for politicians, CEOs and future leaders."
8905,very useful
8906,Great course and interesting.
8907,"Excellent course, engaging, a great way to learn Python for those with little or no prior programming experience."
8908,"The course covers basis of PID, state-space control and links them to behaviour-based control of mobile roots for navigation in an unknown environment. Prof. Egerstedt's teaching style is the best part of the course which is both intuition and mathematical. I highly recommend this course for anyone who is looking forward to pursue root control."
8909,The course is wonderful. I learn a lot about of.
8910,Thank you very much for all the information. It's been a pleasure to take up this course; it will definitely help me improve my performance.
8911,"His course was really great. It help to broaden my knowledge.His was my first time to take a course about finance, i love the course and the teacher is great also."
8912,a very good introductory course. as a novice in d printing it helped me a lot understanding the basis of d printing.
8913,Excellent course. The video lessons were really information. The assignment given every week were fun to do and also tested your skill.
8914,"I wish I had this course before I started college. I'm pretty sure at one point or another I did everything exactly opposite of what this course reaches. I often crammed, did not study effectively, and definitely fooled myself on multiple occasions of thinking I understood material.Everyone who is serious about learning better should take this course."
8915,Fantastic course with great instructor!
8916,"A very basic course, and tormented more towards economics and predictions behavior. The course sure is nice, but not what I had expected. Wanted something more on the logic side. The one by Stanford looks better-suited."
8917,I learned lot many things related with energy scenario. Overall this course is good.
8918,I struggle sometimes with tests. But after all everything when was good
8919,this course offered some very useful information that you can make use of immediately if you wish
8920,"organized, insightful. Or. Miss clearly has a passion for the music which comes through in his teaching,"
8921,Wonderful logical explanation of the new dog cognition theory. I'm excited to see how this knowledge & research will affect dog training in the future.
8922,"Very good course, well constructed,"
8923,Met another fantastic course in the specialization where I learned a lot!
8924,"Great overview of several of concepts and topics. Being a patron fan I was skeptically in taking a course where the assignment were restricted to using octavo. Met, I was pleasantly surprised by how every lecture and assignment set was explained via basic linear algebra, and was impressed by the speed and efficiency of octavo's framework of working with marines. I also a little surprised that Random Forests and Decision tree based also were not covered in the course."
8925,Very Useful Course ^_^
8926,"Loud Computing is the Future and prof is explaining the future very clearly , i really enjoy learning from him."
8927,"Excellent introductory course on bones. There is a bit of writing involved for weekly assignment, which can take time, but for the most part everything you need to complete them is within lectures. Very responsive forum moderation."
8928,"Great course for beginners to get the basis of Web Development, HTML, CSS and Javascript."
8929,"The scope of the course is really limited, and that is fine for super-introductory courses like this one, but all the emotional attachments aside, looking only into one city's tribunals is questionable from the methodological point of view."
8930,The course is extremely useful. One might know various machine learning algorithms. But this course covers sincere approach to use particular algorithm in a particular situation. It covers minute details of these algorithms. Excellent!!
8931,Very good materials. Assignment are a good way to test knowledge acquired.
8932,It was a challenging task but I liked it. Thank you !!! I has been a pleasure!
8933,"Great course on repression. Covers almost all aspects on how to build a repression model from scratch, also covers few advanced topics swell."
8934,"All the concepts are very clearly presented and the instructor is really a great teacher!That I liked the most is that special attention is given to the fine distinction between statistical concepts that students easily confuse, myself included.The senators are also very helpful and very prompt to respond to any questions."
8935,Thanks. It's very useful to start game development .
8936,"His course is very fun especially the lectures. Beside that, all the topics have conceptual sample that very easy to understand"
8937,His course was very information and delivered in a comprehensible manner. The topics were well designed and flowed in a sequence that helped the learner add on the knowledge as they progressed. I was inspired to do new things towards a locally sustainable world even in my little corner. It was a privilege to be taught by the very experienced Prof Geoffrey Each! Thank you Coursera!
8938,It's an incredible course with detail explanations and interactive quires.
8939,Very information.
8940,"The course reaches ways to help victims in a disaster situation. Professor Very's course materials were easy to understand and enjoyable. The quires always related directly to the course material, and I feel that I learned what the course set out to teach me. Thank you Prof. Very!"
8941,Will be useful to take the Dayton Purse before this one. You only learn when you do the assignment.
8942,Lots of information packed in this course. I benefited a lot by doing this course. Thank you for putting together such a wonderful course.
8943,"Andrew is great, I have become a fan of him. He has made all the topics so easy to understand. Oats off sir."
8944,"The course was very information, well organized and easy to understand and relate to."
8945,Amazing learning experience! But simply yet comprehensive. A must-do course!
8946,highly recommended
8947,"The course gives a whole comprehension of the essential listening to music. It is very interesting because it involves history, art as well."
8948,I wish I could have taken this course before I began my academic career. The theories and practices discussed in this course have the potential to lastly accelerate your learning.
8949,Definitely the best CSS3 tutoring I have seen at Coursera
8950,"Really helpful, puts the process of learning into a new perspective."
8951,"Very helpful course for anyone who plans to use any form of programming. Helps you to wrap your head around the terms and their meaning. I have found having taken this course as being helpful now that I am taking a course covering JavaScript.The instructor on this course is EXCELLENT with presentation and is enjoyable. The class demands a lot of hands-on time, but is fun if you enjoy solving problems and making things work."
8952,Highly recommended. It's a self-paced course but you'll get more out of it by enabling deadline to keep you on track.
8953,His course gave me an overall understanding of the globe of that period of time. His course helped me to understand why individual countries were in the situation they were. I am not into academic pursue but fully enjoyed the course. The professor was very clear about his ideas and pleasant to follow. Highly recommend for all people interested in modern history.
8954,"The course material is of; the lectures are fun and interesting, but to pass the course you need to submit an assignment that is subjected to peer review and you will need to get approval by all of your peers. However the act of subscribing to a MOOC alone does not make people suited to review other peoples work..."
8955,In interesting introduction to functional programming. His course can be a little more challenging compared to other MOOC's if you do not have prior programming experience. You will learn a lot about the concepts behind programming construct.
8956,The visual and practical examples are very useful as they can even permeate even the very educated with understanding.
8957,"Well explained content, though at times the presentation felt a little slow. Solid coming assignment that do a good job of enforcing the course materials. A couple small topics weren't explained clearly but overall it's been a very information class. Thanks for the knowledge!"
8958,Great into course!
8959,"His is a great course to give intuition about the major machine learning concepts. The course explains the mathematical background on an intermediate level that is just perfect to get one started on this track but not too much detailed so as to focus on the subject instead. The homework are very well planned and interesting, maybe a bit even too easy to complete, but lots of fun. Professor G is a great lecturer and I liked his style and presentations so much, that I will definitely take his other courses as well. Thank for the journey!"
8960,fantastic overview and practice on key concepts
8961,Truly helpful! It's an engaging boost by going back to the basis.
8962,"would love to see a continuation of this course,"
8963,Great information about d printing. It helps you to understand what is the current scope of this technology and how you can start.
8964,"Well developed and fast paced. His course is for intermediate students. Prof. Chaikin has a thorough understanding of how all of the pieces (HTML, CSS, of, design, photography, and copy editing) work together to create a useful and engaging web site. You will also pick up and learn to use great tools along the way: GitHub, Sublime Next, and BrowserSync among others. The instructor is engaging and precarious, as keeps in touch with the discussion forms."
8965,"I've had this course 'IMC' 4 times in my college. His time was way much better. His course is practically amazing as we see each concept being applied to the ground work. and that's so exciting, we really benefit and see how the real work looks like. i'd highly recommend it."
8966,"Simply another great course within Coursera courses, thank you very much."
8967,it's really easy for me. I finished it in a day.
8968,Great instructor. The course is concise but full of good observations about how to use HTML and Javascript.
8969,Very information and engaging!
8970,"Great content, really helpful course."
8971,"ProsThe information is good. His class is good for learning the vocabulary in graphics design. I already understood more general terms like scale and form. I learned new terms like figure/ground and visual contrast (or how graphics design defines it).ConsThe teacher's pace for some of the video is slow for the amount of information. In week 4, the pace slightly quickens. But overall, it's really slow.verdict would recommend this course for learning the terms of graphics design or getting a basic understanding of design principles. I also found the assignment fun. Of you have some understanding of the basis of design and art, you do not need to watch every video. Feel free to skin on video covering terms you have a general idea about."
8972,"I love the detailed advice and resources in the course. Very clear, very well spoken."
8973,It's amazing course . I really enjoying it right now cause it has a lot of information and help me to realise what is the problem and it gives me tools to solve my problem and the common problem it that way .. so Thanks for learn how to learn team :D
8974,"I enjoyed this course very much. Going into this course, my goal was to review English grammar and improve my writing. After finishing it, I feel like I accomplished that goal. I enjoyed concise and clear style of the video and clarity of examples given in them. Assignment and exercises, although challenging at times, were of comfortable length and fun to do. Personally, this course helped me to become aware of the sentences I write, and gave me the tools to revise and edit my writings more efficiently on my own."
8975,Compact and information lectures that de-mystery the art form. Thank you!(Will need to practice a lot for it all to sink in though)
8976,His course was great. I went from having a decent grasp on statistics and a little knowledge of software like SPSS to being employed as a data analyst where most of my job is using R.
8977,Great course to start machine learning
8978,"Disappointing. Must brushed the surface of most of the topics, felt a bit too much like an ad for PWC or story telling about client engagements. Content was lacking"
8979,"Thank you for sharing the Course. The course provides clear guidance and always reminding how important it is to be an ethical journalist. With the assignment for each lesson at each week push us to be more creative in ideas of preparing and planning news and types of resources.Appreciate, and hoping that Coursera will always be there for us who look forward to update and learn knowledge that can help us in compete with the current always changing world, the same time as Coursera will keep on dating and considering on the comments/reviews from your Earners.Would be great if the courses presented could be totally unfordable and free for all :)"
8980,"Positive: Very interesting and information lectures and subject matter.Negative: Fellow ""students"" who have no knowledge of the subject (other than what they themselves are learning) are required to submit case studies for ""peer review"" by other students who have no more knowledge of the subject than they do. These case studies are heavily weighted and if the person is reviewed negative (for whatever reason), they must submit it never knowing why they were given low scores or what the correct answer should have been. To instructor assistance is given. Huge turn-off for me and many of my fellow students. I want to withdraw (drop) this class and take another with more clearly drawn parameter."
8981,Very good course.
8982,Great introductory Course! The professor was easy to understand and took the time to explain in a clear and concise manner! Great job!
8983,Somehow this section is bit confusing or rather to say the content is not really enough to work alone. Not even to solve the assignment without example codes.
8984,The course is extensive. Starting from the basis. Well planned and delivered.
8985,"Good course to know the basis of of and of, the references are very helpful to deep in the topics."
8986,Great course for introduction to functional programming.
8987,Challenging and fun!
8988,I am proud of learning a course about the History of the modern state of Israel beginning from Unionism Ideology till the state of Israel was born.His is the History of the Jewish people and the fulfillment of the Biblical Prophecy for the News to inherit the Promised And which foretold by the prophets before 2000 years ago.
8989,A wonderful course. I'll definitely recommend it to my friends who are interested in Chinese language and culture.
8990,"Thanks Him and relative staffs. You help me to understand the Calculus in deep, and know that Path is really fun and helpful. Though I leaned it several years ago, but now I really get some new concepts about it. Thanks every again!"
8991,His is great! Thank you very much.
8992,Very basic
8993,Very professionally presented. Of I had the money I would knoll in the Master program!
8994,"Amazing course, Professor G is very knowledgeable and a great teacher. Complex concepts in of were explained thoroughly and patiently, and the exercises are fun and well constructed."
8995,Thank you very much. I learned a lot in this course. I recommend it!
8996,"Very Very good, if you want to learn something just try these classes !!!"
8997,His is possibly one of the best introductory course to finance markets.
8998,Very well built.
8999,basic and useful
9000,Very nice course. Specially the instructor is very helpful & knowledgeable person. I am very much grateful to The University of Edinburgh for providing this course.
9001,Great course but a lack of formula in of files is very uncomfortable
9002,"Excellent material and methods, i found the course extremely useful and practical"
9003,"Great course on Machine Learning. The course doesn't emphasise the memorisation of concepts, but provides a deep understanding of the practical and theoretical sides to Machine Learning."
9004,One of the best course that I ever seem before. I'm really happy to do that and I know that was important to my career.
9005,Great course.
9006,"The best course I've ever taken. Or. Chuck is really cool, he is able to present material in such a way that you really start loving Python and everything seems much easier than it actually is. His course is for complete beginners. I've already finished another course on Python (from Vice University) after this one, and I must admit that the course from University of Michigan helped me a lot! Thank you!"
9007,very useful
9008,It's a good course if you want a general overview of the statistics of clinical research. Personally I was hoping for a little more depth in some of the statistical methods. Some links or suggested reading on the methods would be great as we move along the course. Overall a delightful course. Everything is clearly explained. Thank you Or. Copper!
9009,A Great course for anyone who wants to improve their diet. You wound'it find any other course out there.
9010,Great Course
9011,is a good Course i am practicing all that i learn about how to learn i hope obtain very good results
9012,its really fantastic....
9013,I love this course. The content helped me a lot to get more clarity on this area.The content is structures in six weekly nodules and every section is very well prepared. The video are interesting and have the right length (not too long) and helped me to stay on track.
9014,Great course!
9015,Great introduction to of. Highly recommended!
9016,Great introduction to Machine Learning. However the assignment are often too simple.
9017,"His is really helpful and exhaustive. Of you are trying to find a course to learn Machine Learning, this is what you need."
9018,"Exceptional information and lessons to better understand what was the struggle for Civil Rights. The teachings of Or. lafayette invite to take the brief experience as a case study, worthy of being analyzed and considered when comparing it to other social movements."
9019,"The instructor, Pollen van Went was great! Great material for the beginner. I highly recommend this."
9020,I gained a lot of English knowledge
9021,"Intuitive, clear, neither too fast nor too slow.. easy to follow"
9022,Amazing course! Andrew of explains incredibly well what machine learning is all about. I learned a lot of new concepts. His course was a real pleasure to follow
9023,was a great experience.
9024,very clear
9025,Very useful course for social entrepreneurs. Thank you!!
9026,"I really liked the course its both useful and entertaining, i would recommend it for any one who's interested in journalism"
9027,"Continuing from the previous course, the instructor explore some key concepts of Investment Management that really define the way an investor thinks and acts.Very explanatory lectures and interesting discussions from passionate and keen lectures."
9028,"The course does a wonderful job of tracing modernity, postmodernity and traumatism thought over the years. Moved how Michael leaves together literature and art into the course of explaining how these ideas have shaped our world. I wish I could have taken this course in person. Highly recommended."
9029,Or. Have Dixon is great!
9030,"I discover the beauty of Beethoven's piano sonata through Or. Miss clear, interesting and engaging lectures. I like the fact that he himself is a performing pianist that made all the domo very enjoyable and convincing.Also, I did not quite understand the greatness of Beethoven's late sonata before and now I almost cannot pass by a week without listening to one. Thanks for introducing me to the world of late period of Beethoven. Now there is much more to be explored: string quarters, piano tries, miss solemn, etc."
9031,Excellent course. Greetings from Egypt. :)
9032,"Quite repetition in covering basic grafting, and very shallow in regards of fluttering, SVD and PCA."
9033,"Clear video's, structure is missing sometimes, but great examples"
9034,"It's a simple and straight-forward course that brings you through the basis pretty fast. Of you have the time, you could actually do the whole course in a day or two, just coming back for peer review. There are no surprise and the projects are simple. The instructor even lists what the objects of each lesson and video are, so if you need to look back at a specific feature, you need only look at the titles and then watch that one video. It's also interesting to see what people think of when creating a second level, if they try to go further."
9035,"Very good. It is better than the ""Mandarin for Beginners"" course in ex."
9036,Great Course!!!
9037,"The course integrated information on practical benefits of meditation, results from scientific studies of neutral responses, and historical and philosophical perspective. Also, I found the guided meditations very helpful and interviews quite interesting."
9038,"Very well explained, nice and interesting examples, offers good programs and tools to use and explore."
9039,what a great specialization and series of courses... highly recommend!
9040,"very good for one who has no idea about machine learning , but I dont like dato"
9041,Although I gave 5 stars but the background music in the video lectures is really irritating.
9042,"Moved it, covered the material needed to get started."
9043,"It´s great, Excellent ,I recommend Spanish subtitles .Thank."
9044,"i had no knowledge in web apt. After this course, I feel confident now to go out and start using all the APIs out there and build my own patron application"
9045,Its amazing how the simple technique taught here can change our learning.
9046,Excellent!I is a really good idea about the game
9047,"Lectures were great, very hands-on, the instructor is amazing!"
9048,Great course! I recommend it!
9049,I do not have any background in computer science and this course was easy to follow along and learn the basis. I thoroughly enjoyed Or.Severance's way of explaining abstract concepts and how we repeatedly go over concepts. The quires and assignment were a great way to review ideas in the book while giving us the opportunity to use our newly acquired knowledge.
9050,Love! Highly recommended for beginners!
9051,Great into and very clear content.
9052,"i kept expecting the colonel to pop around saying ""no, no, stop that! it's silly!"". :This course was tons of fun and the lecturer is suitably good with his examples. i loved the randomness and learned quite a bit. if you're thinking about game development, but you're not sure where to start, then give this a go. it's an entry-level course and there is a lot of lessons on c# programming... which is 95% of the course. if you know c#, then the lessons dealing with the fundamentals of c# programming might feel a bit tedious, but the examples are fun, so you won't mind learning about these things again.i liked this course. you can see he enjoys what he does, which makes you enjoy it as well and helps you learn more."
9053,"His course will be very help for me in my master track. Since I am doing master in this field so I want to study all the topic in more detail. Furthermore, the course is helpful for me in my career development."
9054,I've learned a lot from this. Thanks course.org and John Hopkins University.
9055,Very nice course and very helpful. It really helps to gain the in-depth visualization and analysis skill
9056,I think the instructor is great.
9057,"The course has nearly nothing to do with the previous themes. I already have had enough knowledge, but as there is no support by the team it seems to be rather time consuming for others."
9058,Wonderful course! It's a great introduction to the topic of embodied cognition. By only suggestion is to expand it for the people who are really interested in these topics.
9059,"I Team,Course is good.Sides and contents need to be updated on regular basis, sometimes data discussed is bit outdated."
9060,"Excellent course, very well structures, explained and with loads of practical and useful tips."
9061,"The course was extremely interesting, it helped me a lot in general about how markets operate, and how they are interlines within the economy. The course would have been more fruitful if more numerical examples and explanations were given in lectures."
9062,"Thanks, I enjoyed the course and learn a lot in it!"
9063,Excellent explanations and proper and useful assignment given at the right time to implement the algorithms in practice immediately after theory material.
9064,"Very unapproachable material, given the diversity of classification algorithms."
9065,"His course was very disappointing and much of the content in the tests and course did not show up in the course project. I felt like the course project was far more advanced than all the other detail. In addition, there was minimal to of detail on instruction. VERY poor development here and I would not recommend it to anyone. All you need to do is look at all the threads of complaints. I am looking forward to the next Python course and h"
9066,"I really enjoyed doing the course. I found the content interesting and stimulating. Everything went really well until the last assignment when the webster refused to let me submit and it became very frustration and worrying as, despite my increasingly frantic requests for assistance, nothing seemed to change and I missed the submission deadline and then got all these messages saying I would have to do the course again. I am relieved to see it didn't come to that and that I did pass but I would suggest that an email address where I could feel I was actually communicating with a person would have improved my experience at the end. I have already paid for my course certificate (at the start of the course) so am hoping that as I have now submitted my photo of and additional photo for purification purposes that will come to me soon."
9067,Any thanks for this delightful course.
9068,"Professor Daniel McFarland of Stanford University, deliver here an inspiring and attention-grafting course about how to find structures keys and solutions for an environment where most organizational problems are distinctive to the circumstances and cannot be elucidate by simple click.The eleven weeks of materials was indeed long and personally very difficult to absorb, but the final reward is 100% worth it!!I am highly thankful to Professor Daniel McFarland, for allowing me to be part of his class and sharing us (students) generously his extensive knowledge, theories and thoughts about new ways to enlighten work environment, and understand in a systematic, practical manner & the behind-the-curtain; the industrialized world we are living.For geographical reasons, it will be technically impossible for me to attend Professor Daniel McFarland classes at Stanford University and thanks to his generous patience, engagement and priceless time to prepare this exceptional course,I am really honored and proud to have joined this outstanding and must learn course here on course!!!Definitively a cellar 5 Star rating!!!"
9069,"I loved the course. I will use all the Mechanics described here for learning German language (my currently nightmare :) ) .Thanks,Cristina"
9070,It opens a window to music education for everyone.
9071,"Great into to machine learning. Not too simple, but not too complicated for those without calculus skill. Very good mix of theory vs. practice and reasonable assignment were very useful to learning.He need a machine learning 2!"
9072,"I would LOVE to give this course 5 stars because I absolutely loved it. However, one small thing that drove me nuts makes me give it 4 star rating. I am a big type A personality and I wanted a perfect 100% grade. For this reason I take very, very detailed notes and studied very hard. When I was taking the tests, all of the answers came to me and I knew they were right without question. When I would get marked wrong some answers at the end. For example, there were several questions relating to the 4 phases of the design cycle. These should very easy answers as the question was usually ""That follows after the 'alternative design phase"" which is an easy answer, ""prototyping"". Regardless it would be marked wrong, and it was absolutely impossible to get 100% and I encountered this issue on about 3 questions. I would encourage you to make sure your answers are properly programme into the response bank"
9073,"His course was incredibly delightful and very helpful, as a media and communication student, this course widened the information I had and helped me with my home university courses. Thank you!"
9074,The course made me think. The instruction was clear. His was an enjoyable experience.
9075,"Great course, thanks Roger"
9076,His is a fantastic course if you need to take your front-end development skill to the next level.
9077,"His course really helped me, in daily life. It is really well explained and useful, I recommend !"
9078,Course design and objective of the course is good but the assignment were of sub-standard and can be really worked out to be better.
9079,Simple and clear explanation of the basis.
9080,"I learned a lot of things in this course, this course was extremely helpful for my personal branding."
9081,Awesome stuff <3
9082,Very useful.
9083,Great information! Well organized.
9084,Grand Skyhorse was my favorite Professor. It was extremely helpful and will be wonderful for the capstone project.
9085,Thanks to all the team and to the professor for this course.
9086,Now!!! an excellent and very detailed course with a great teacher Scott Weisbenner who really masters the topics added to a unique sense of humour. I definitely recommend it!
9087,"There appears to be some missing lectures, if you look on the forms other classmates have evidence of that."
9088,Thank you David. It is a wonderful course.
9089,"The course is great! However, there are no written examples of expectations for weeks 4 and 5 It least David Will shows examples after lectures. Not everyone is an audible learner therefore written examples should be posted for week 5"
9090,"Great course, but a bit short."
9091,Great introductory course. An't thank you enough for putting this together.
9092,"One of the previous classes will prepare you for this one. His is not really a class, but rather a project on a topic NEVER covered in any of the previous classes in this specialization."
9093,LOVE of! Really fun :)
9094,"Good courses and necessary for people like me who never have a relation to computer science,,, But it is a waste of money...ll"
9095,One of the best courses I've ever taken! The companion Took is Fantastic!!
9096,Too easy
9097,"I really liked the content and presentation of the course. I had to know Scala for another course at college and this was the perfect crash course. Also, it is being taught by its creator, so that's pretty cool. I liked the assignment too. However, the final assignment did not totally cover all the material for week 5 and 6, and was a bit of a disappointment. Great course overall."
9098,"His course was difficult for me to grasp. The instructor (I believe) assumes that all participants have some background in programming, and since I do not, I have a very difficult time following the examples. I bought the entire series of classes, but need to retaken this one after I read some more from other sources and have had a chance to digest what's here."
9099,Good introductory course on psychology for a novice like me. The human behavior is fascinating and the breadth of the course covers this aspect in a few good way. The professor is also very knowledgeable and makes the class fun with additional reference material.
9100,Excellent course that is very progressive and based on practice. Pollen An Went is a very good teacher who her video are of excellent quality: a perfect mix between theory and practice.
9101,That a great course. Must take for teach Product Managers!
9102,Great course. Daniel explains everything clearly and with examples in R code which makes all of the concepts easier to understand. A must-take for experimental psychologist.
9103,Good course to learn R who plan to or are into data science/statistical field.
9104,"I am a big advocate of MOOCs as it definitely democratic education. Only challenge with MOOCs is that over time they become too monotonous and one loose out the interest. I've tried to take up few machine learning courses over past few years, but never got past first few steps. I am still in the going through the course, but so far it has been an outstanding experience. Not only the content is engaging, it has been really simplifies. Of you're new to Machine learning, I can't recommend this highly enough."
9105,Great course!
9106,Thank you Or. Chuck. I ran away from programming all my life but this course really got me interested in programming. Thanks.
9107,"Very enjoyable, easily translatable to real world scenario and completely relevant and focused. It was a joy to learn and I had a lot to implement after successful completion of this course"
9108,Great！ And I strongly recommend everyone to learn it.
9109,Excellent course. I have enjoyed and learned a lot. Thanks
9110,"Good understanding on emerging concepts, experiences from Scandinavian countries and gets me exploring possibilities in our environment/ cities."
9111,"The course is amazing, I want to purchase the course but it is not being working...I don't know what is the problem."
9112,These guns use the best examples to make statistics fun!
9113,His was a great overview of key concepts. Great introduction to the industry with the right level of specific detail to enable understanding.
9114,"A good useful course for beginners. The last assignment takes much more than 30 minutes though, it takes at least a few hours, unless you are an experienced developer."
9115,"Gros:Some useful terminology if you want to ever communicate with someone who does recommended systems.Sons:Very diluted content.Mostly large text sides with the presented talking in a monotony voice.Programming exercises are done in Cava and require deploying an IDE + an unused open source project developed by the authors. Lint to the authors: use Python, R or Active like everyone does.Some of the questionaries are ambiguous."
9116,His is another great course in the series. Thanks Professor!
9117,"Very good introductory course. It's a lot of material to cover for a newby, but if you have some background, you will find you progress pretty quickly. Enjoyable, engaging, fun and useful."
9118,Very information and the speaker is very good.
9119,"His was a great course, and a great refreshed on Python!"
9120,"His course gives general information on the magic of middle ages. However, I wish the course could be arranged in a more logical and coherent way, such as geographical or chronological, which will help to understand and memories. Material in Week 4 is very confusing. It is hard to get the key points from those materials and what the instructor want to tell me. In the other hand, materials in Week 2 is easy to be understood and reflected in the first written assignment."
9121,The course is very well organised and presented.
9122,Good information. Very helpful. Would be more entertaining at some parts.
9123,"it actually introduced c++11 features to me well,it was my first course on course and it is beneficial to me in ways ."
9124,"The instructor is fantastic, really inst"
9125,I learned quite a bit from this instructor in a short period of time. He has a way of explaining things that really makes it sink in. The one thing I would change is not to have so many chords to learn in one week toward the end of the class. I would add a few weeks to the course.
9126,Great course. Awesome way to get started in database. Should be more hands on on the Python part
9127,"The course provides complete information and guidance for a beginner in Web designing. He being unfamiliar with programming before starting here, our senators and teachers provided study material in such a manner helped me (a fresh come) learn HTML, CSS and of quickly and pretty well. In a month, you really do learn a lot. You require a good amount of self-discipline and education for learning any new subject, specially if you're judging it with a job or being a university student. But the quality of lecture video, the material provided for extra learning and the weekly amount of work is perfect for reaching you in Web Resigning.Good Luck !!!"
9128,"I once had a boyfriend who said my mind was like an encyclopedia that had come free from its binding. To some extent that's true, and it makes me, I think, fun to drink with. I think the Prof of this course would be super fun to drink with, too. I can only imagine the directions the conversation would career, how many diversions and versions and agents we would go on. In terms of instruction, though, I find it rather exhausting. First we're talking about Ottoman reforms, then a diversion into Soothe (or some other your Teutonic thinker) then a agent into- but we'll cover that in another video so in 1924, but if you read L'etranger.... I've taken to listening to the lectures while doing something else, and then passing the transcripts, trying to tease out some sort of linear narrative for my notes and it's just so effortful and time-consuming."
9129,amazing professor and examples that made a very difficult topic comprehensible
9130,very much explained in detailed . Very concept is clear now. Thanks!
9131,It's a very helpful course as introduction to entrepreneurship world. It's very rich by knowledge about how take the risk to identify and utilize opportunities and get in the marketplace.
9132,Great course from the great man! Of you want to dive into of - that's the starting point.
9133,Must the right course to begin with to play with web data/apt's
9134,A very helpful course helped me in recollection different of concepts
9135,Good course
9136,"Very good, absolutely essential for understanding current affairs!"
9137,"His course helped me understand key concepts of Object Printed Programming. By doing the weekly assignment, I had a chance to practice what I have learnt straight way."
9138,awesome course...
9139,"Very interesting course. I would recommend it to everyone. The only thing that was not so useful for me were nodules which are very specific such as Bonds. However, these might be useful in the future, for we dont only work where we live.Great course!"
9140,Good practical things taught here!
9141,"Professor Andrew of，thank you very very much! I have learned many machine learning theory form this course.It is so kindly to understand, and the method explained very carefully. I really enjoy it! ：）"
9142,"The learning process is a complete experience, full of knowledge, good video and excellent teachers. I think is a 5 stars quality course, because of the amount of tools teachers give. Each one special and necessary.Trophic Design is about making our soul, heart and brain work together. I believe this course is a great way to get this team to complete our expectations."
9143,good course
9144,very good and challenging
9145,Was hard to keep up with work as well.
9146,High level but useful basis.
9147,The course is absolutely needed for anyone who wants to start a career in of. There are few areas of improvement but that could be my way of interpretation.of I suggest people who wants to start their career in of or who wants to break the margin of of to spend time and do this course. There is no better course than this.
9148,very great lecture
9149,Great course!!!! Fig round of applause for the coach :D
9150,Moved this course. Very interesting and fun to experiment with the different aspects of design.
9151,"great into to game design , the materials was so much fun"
9152,"Simple, smart teaching, very enlightening. I advise this course to anyone who wants go get hands on machine learning experience, right now."
9153,Perfect
9154,His got a lot more challenging.
9155,Outstanding. Really a gives a insight to decision making and based on latest findings.
9156,The lecturer is honestly a bit slow in his coverage of content and his scribbling is untidy. He also seems to want to intentionally make SQL look like its very simple and avoids giving interesting facts which he thinks may complicate the content but would be good to know anyway.
9157,His course is very helpful for someone to know and understand what data science is in Small amount of time.
9158,The West Course on this Platform :)
9159,The course was still useful and with new information but I really found it lacking adhesion with the overall specialization and with its own content.
9160,Great course
9161,"Thank you for offering this course. It has taught me a lot of things that I hadn't known. I'm interested in Accounting and there were some times I didn't know where I could gain the materials for study. Now thanks to your courses, I don't need to worry so much. Hope you will continue to produce more"
9162,"His course has taught me very well about developing my career skill. I highly encourage everyone to also take this course and learn what I've learned. To my teachers and classmates, thank you so much. I couldn't have done this without your help."
9163,"Great material and tutor!The only thing is that it is a bit hard to get starting if you are new to octavo, coming and machine learning. I wasted days on small errors that would not let my code run. A not mandatory assignment for beginners might help where every step is spelled out in even more detail but you actually have to write it yourself and submit it. :-) But this is of course a very minor critique - again, GREAT COURSE!Thanks a lot"
9164,top!
9165,"I really started to get interested in R only when I started this course.Before that, it was just an old, cystic language that could not do more than what I can do with Expel.Now I am starting to see the full potential"
9166,"Very good courses, it is practical and clear. Everyone should have taking a such courses, because it is in every day life."
9167,All I was expecting to review and learn.
9168,Good course
9169,His course really delve in deep into the various theories encapsulated in organizational analysis. The content in covered extensively given the platform and time constraint. Professor Macfarland really made taking this class a pleasure.
9170,"was a good course for person as me, that don´t know nothing about programming"
9171,Excellent course! Learned so much and the nodules were easy to follow. I would recommend this to anyone.
9172,Very interesting and not so hard. Interview questions are sometimes thicker than practical exercises.
9173,A great pleasure for me to be part of this awesome course. I have enjoyed it as a child.
9174,I think this course is helpful and we can learn a lot from it.
9175,"Great course... Or Rebel, I think, is one of the best teacher that I ever have had, his experience in Negotiation issues give different points of view that probably it will facilitate negotiations in common day or in business."
9176,I expected much more detailed and deeper knowledge from the course.
9177,Vice course to develop the basic programming in R and getting started
9178,Very good introduction
9179,His is an excellent course for everyone who wants to basic financial understanding
9180,A course you will only be grateful to yourself for taking...
9181,"Resigning experiments wasn't what I thought, and had a very steep learning curve."
9182,excellent course for both beginner and moderately advanced economy students and enthusiast. press Kretchmer is very well spoken and explicit with his content
9183,this coarse is very interesting i really enjoy it
9184,That a wonderful course! His is a unique perspective that links human history with science and the very beginnings of our universe.
9185,A lot of new concepts were introduced with good clarity. All the path was less vigorous which was perfect to understand and get hold on important technique.
9186,Love it
9187,Simple and nice!!
9188,"in simple terms, an absolutely amazing course, which introduced me to novel concepts I never knew existed. By learning process will never be the same again! Thank you very much Prof. Valley and Prof. Sejnowski!"
9189,"Useful, many basic functions, but introduced me to some new functions and their uses."
9190,"A life changing course, width great instructor"
9191,The teachers are very funny !
9192,"I rate this class 5/5 because the instruction, content, resources, and pacing are all excellent, and this course is true to its description. Highly recommended for anyone who has taken Python for Everybody (Getting Started in Python). These two courses are a best match for someone learning their first programming language. Learning with Professor Severance is fun, in bite-sized pieces, and with just enough challenge to keep you engaged and moving forward without getting discouraged. Professor Severance has mastered teaching programming at scale. Thank you!"
9193,this course is one of the greatest sources of information that I have been able to get my hands on.
9194,Prefer more references/examples shown in lectures.
9195,the best ever
9196,great course
9197,Learned so much -- amazing course!
9198,His pretty good but maybe should explore more than just theory septa chords blue and jazz encganche something that although is very good explanation leaves you anelando something more modern.
9199,A practical and funny way to learn and understand how Angular works
9200,His is a very good start point. It gave me great confidence!
9201,I really enjoyed this course. The lectures came across as very knowledgeable and enthusiastic which compelled you to continue. The content was interesting and well presented.
9202,It is wonderful. I really enjoyed it.
9203,Excellent course. Build up from basic to complex concepts very well.
9204,it was very useful course specially that content about construction technology tends and the guns delivered it very simple and covered almost most of construction management topics. can't wait to the next course from columbia university
9205,"Wonderful course. gets you through the basis and beyond in getting and cleaning data from diverse sources. Very well thought and explained. There is a lot to be learnt from this course, and it requires devoting a good amount of time to let the material sink in."
9206,"Very helpful, I am so enjoy!"
9207,Very good course for patron enthusiast
9208,"Very good course, the content is great and well organized. The sides with code are a bit of an embarrassment for the University of California. The code is presented on what looks like a power point slide with bullets so the forgetting and ligament is totally missed up, and then there are no shortage of type's and code errors. But, the material is very good and Era Oh does an excellent job presenting it.All in all a great course and exactly what I was looking for."
9209,The lectures are quick and concise. The lecturer speaks very clearly and gives great examples that illustrate the concepts well.
9210,Very fantastic course! I want say 'Thank you' to Fro. Andrew G! I've really learned a lot in machine learning!
9211,The video lectures and the course assignment are all challenging; and that moves my urge to go on & on...I love this course
9212,Learning how to learn has never been easier and more fun! His course is an invaluable aid to learn ANYTHING. It provides 'know-how' and confidence in your ability to master any subject matter. The technique provided to deal with procrastinator have significantly impacted my life. I am grateful to Coursera and to instructor Terence Sejnowsi and especially Barbara Valley for making learning such a pleasure. Thank you!
9213,"Vice one , His course having basis of the management , i will recommended to all my peers bout that... thanks to course."
9214,Basis and stories of financial market. Not very deep but granting you a comprehensive understanding of current financial institutions and their functions.
9215,Good course. I have already recommended to a friend.
9216,"Well structures, concise and an overall joy to watch, this course makes it easy to learn physiology."
9217,Great course! Highly recommended.
9218,"Very helpful if you are picking up writing again. Not to time consuming, the content is manageable and the instructor is very clear and concise!"
9219,"Only for introduction, more materials should be supplied."
9220,Excellent course and well taught.His is my second course i completed first is getting started with patron.:)
9221,"Professor is engaging and I am happy there are so many video lectures, it is really nice and you feel you are genuinely progressing. Quizzes are very tough though and this course requires a lot of education and some frequent repeats of the video to understand the material."
9222,better than my other courses
9223,Andrew G's contagious passion and enthusiasm towards Machine Learning is something that boasted my interest in this subject. He reaches with the same passion and reaches beautifully. The course structure is great. His course is a must for anybody interested in Machine Learning. His is an experience that cannot be replaced by anything else.
9224,In excellent course . Everything you wanted to know about mountain and more.
9225,"Fro: All topics seem to be covered, full overview of this field.On: Please, please, get rid of the childish drawings and get so serious network."
9226,Very good basic management course and good explanation of the different roles of managers
9227,"Really good course, it is very helpful and interesting!"
9228,Very good start to front-end programming. The instructor engaged the audience well and explained the concepts clearly and in detail.There was a exponental jump between week 3 lectures and week 3 quit. I had to do much additional research on the web to pass that.
9229,"Very clear, very good visual, easy to follow. Highly recommended. I only wished the DataCamp examples were in Python, not R, but I understand R is a more natural choice for non-programme. The lab and the presented theory are well since."
9230,Very interesting! I'm sharing the video with my students. (with permission of course ;))
9231,"His class is an extreme example of an introduction to a subject - very basic information. I would guess that anyone who actually knows the term ""Internet of Things"" and was able to find this course already knows all of the content presented here. For completeness and ensuring that everyone is on the same page, I suppose it it required. I took off one star for how basic, yet drawn-out the information is (it could have been covered in a single week). The other two stars came off because of how tedious the peer-review assignment are and how little they add to the understanding of the content (it is not hard to understand, so the assignment ends up just being busy work). The two stars I gave were because the instructor seems knowledgable and the rest of the specialization looks promising."
9232,Well designed Online course. Easy to learn. Clear explanation of the concepts.
9233,The most basic concepts are clearly explained and many practical advice are given. Deep and detailed explanation of the subject. Excellent background to further study machine learning.
9234,"His course provide a good introduction to github , Studio and command line interface.it also gives a information about different ways to analyse data."
9235,"Very interesting course,"
9236,"Clear and objective, just what you need to set your cooking base straight and build healthy habits for yourself and your family!"
9237,"A great course to start learning about probability and statistics, as well as basic R programming. The final assignment is quite challenging for an introduction course, so plan ahead to make sure you have enough time to complete it."
9238,Great course. I wish I've had it back in school.
9239,Thank you! I really learned a lot and now I'm more motivate to continue studying of even more.
9240,it is an amazing course and a good gate for Machine Learning
9241,Thanks Or. Chuck.
9242,"Amazing course. It helps you understand college life and how college works. And gives you tips on how to get the most out of college. Definitely recommend it, specially for international students."
9243,"Awesome course, it's really interesting!! The teacher is also amazing !"
9244,really good
9245,Thanks for Coursera to give me a valuable opportunity to improve my skill course rocks
9246,"The things I have learnt from this course so far have been amazing, and I am keen on finishing the entire set! Thank you so much for making this course readily available to anyone with an internet connection. I am so grateful to be able to improve myself and am looking forwards to continuing my education."
9247,Great course ! Simple and clear !
9248,It was such a great help in refreshing everything I had forgotten.
9249,GREAT COURSE.......Learning clot
9250,Good introduction to the food and very easy to understand
9251,"Excellent course, i liked so much the content and the way to acquire knowledge throw practice."
9252,The course was very helpful. Thanks a lot to everyone who have made this happen!
9253,Great one!
9254,"Long this course, I discovered the importance of the introspective, how can you discover your strength to improve them, and your weaknesses to work on them."
9255,I like this course. It is my first full course on Coursera!!!
9256,It was great for starting !
9257,It was very easy and slow for a person who has coming experience. I was looking for more tips and tricks.
9258,best Python instruct
9259,His was a great introduction into a Data Scientist Fool Box. While I did enrolled formally in the class it provided me with the knowledge to understand better Data Science. I would definitely recommend this course.
9260,Great
9261,Excellent course anybody who wants a deep understanding of the private equity sector.
9262,Vice Introduction to Data and Analytics
9263,A very concise course on the storytelling strategy for leadership. The professors teach the course very well. A must take course for everyone.
9264,"Awesome course, awesome Professor, awesome learning goals and assignment......really enjoyed this course and I look forward to taking the next course in the specialization. To not hesitate to sign in and join!!!!!!!"
9265,I really appreciated the tools and technique presented in the course. Very very valuable for Merger and Acquisition projects that I will be involved in (if ever)
9266,A very nice course!
9267,His is very helpful.
9268,in this course is a good Idea take the will() section
9269,"Good insight and actionable tips, worth a lifetime."
9270,"I would do it again, even if there was no tutor support in discussion forms it reaches the arguments very good."
9271,"Excellent course! Very knowledgeable professor, yet easy and pleasant to follow. The programme is well structures and the content approached with some depth (considering the introductory nature of the course). I would have loved to see, though, a focus more on philosophy (pre- and post- sciatic), visual arts and the Hellenistic period, as it is most of the times neglected, even in today's historical accounts. Hope to see more courses on Classical Studies soon at Coursera."
9272,The material is good and the professor is clear and knowledgable. Hopefully there would be more reference documents recommended.
9273,His very interesting course looks at both the science and economic factors that influence energy technologies.
9274,very interesting and useful course. I hope that many users will find it relevant. African market and models are absent on the presentation; I appreciate the professor and the sides exercises are quite clear
9275,His was great for me as I am just starting to study biology. It put complicated concepts into accessible language and was a great way to ease myself into studying. I'm looking forward to starting part 2!
9276,It really had a grip on me for such a long duration that I even changed my job just to work in this area. One of the most exciting and fantastic fields to work in. Thanks Andrew for motivation me with this course.
9277,really good started for fresh of.
9278,Great course.
9279,Easy to follow and the discussion board is active.
9280,"The basic ideas exposed during the course are interesting and good food for thought. However the course contents practically depend on the film and book by Swimmer and Pucker; so at the beginning of the course one is shown the complete film, and over the ensuing weeks a particular book chapter and its corresponding fraction of the film is presented again; the quit (which is very little demanding) at the end of the week is basically based on those contents. I paid for the certificate since the idea of a ""specialization"" appealed to me, but I am not sure it was worth."
9281,Excellent course and very enjoyable teacher. Rough assignment but well worth the effort. Really made economics very interesting
9282,"The teacher is very comprehensive and very serious and provides a lot of supplementary reading materials, I like it very much."
9283,good introduction for people who have never do anything with programming. It is really basic knowledge.
9284,"Easily to knows it,i plan to learn more"
9285,His is an ideal starting point for data science journey.
9286,Excellent course with good lectures. Ruin are too memory based but other than that very worth it!
9287,"Great experience. The video are exceedingly well-constructed, and the assignment are haired well with them.By only comment is that I think it would be helpful if links to the PowerPoints used in each video were linked below each video. That said, perhaps it was helpful to the learning experience to have to stop video and hand-copy the relevant code into my IDE."
9288,very helpful! a wide course to start machine learning
9289,"Really helpful, thank"
9290,"The course is very good,and from assignment I also gain a lot.But I still expect teachers can tell us more details."
9291,Only part 3 was partly interesting and useful. All the rest is vain.
9292,"It's a lot better than trying to learn the methods and information on my own without an instructor. I feel very empowered. In any case, the course was a very good brain lookout."
9293,it is a great learning experience.
9294,Great Course! Totally worth studying! The instructor come up with interesting visualizations to explain the concepts.
9295,Great course! The format was accessible and I learned a lot
9296,"Great course, I learned a lot! Must one thing I'd like to see more clearly is that, during the course, all annual interest rates are converted into monthly rates just dividing by 12. Later I learned this means they are nominal rates. Given that in the real world most rates tend to be expressed as effective rates, it would be good if this issue was expressly addressed."
9297,very easy to understand explanation. I am glad to learn from Or. Chuck.
9298,"His course would be great if you are experienced in Python or any other programming language. The title ' Beginner Specialization. To prior experience required.' is very misleading and if you do not have any experience, you will struggle a lot especially to complete week 3 & 4 assignment.It makes you think and requires a lot of self-study, which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skill, however assignment are way too challenging for those who are 'beginners' or have little real-world experience. I would not recommend if you do not have much confidence in your programming 'experience'.Having said that, teaching team is great - very knowledgeable and suppurative."
9299,"The innovations of the different poems were great and taught me a lot about different poetic elements, but the lectures were unbearable corn with all of the different sound effects and bits. I found myself reading the transcripts because I could not watch the video without feeling like I was being talked down to or that the instructor didn't take the course seriously."
9300,A nice introduction to Same Development. The content is great and it doesn't overextend to the point of sharing you off game de. I would give this course 5 stars if it had a little more spice. Everything in the course felt too scraped. I would suggest doing some fun live sessions on the side or something to let us know we're not being taught by roots.
9301,It's the interviews with famous artists which make this course great!
9302,"All information posted in this course is very useful and completed, I did not really expect found all it at the same place. I am completely grateful for attending this course!"
9303,Great course!!!!!!!!!!!!
9304,Good tips provided to make sure nothing has been forgotten in your research process.
9305,Very insightful and fun.
9306,"His is a really good course to get a high level overview of cryptography, the main elements and concepts, and the teacher is really didactic"
9307,Great Introduction to Bootstrap!
9308,I think that this course is excellent.
9309,"Basic course, if you already have programming notions, this course might not be necessary. The teacher is very good and good exercises."
9310,"great cover of what , how, why , to do to get it right"
9311,Excellent course for those starting from strict!
9312,Very Short Sides with great content.
9313,It's the best economic course that i have ever seen. Table Millard is the teacher from God ;)
9314,"Is it told , learning how to learn. I love it."
9315,The amount of materials is more than course period. You may need to study a couple of other resources to understand the course.
9316,"Very engaging, information and inspiring. Highly recommend!"
9317,Great course. I loved the seminary with the different authors. The course was fun and interesting and the professor was knowledgeable and easy to listen to.
9318,Very instructive once you get used to using the subscribed structures. Great enter support and a nice bunch of people to bounce ideas off.
9319,Really good course. Looking forward to the second part!!
9320,Great!
9321,Fool!
9322,A good overview of the development of Archaeology as a science with a few lessons about computer aided recording and qualification of artifacts. Recommended for those who are interested in spreading the archaeological heritage for a broad audience..
9323,"Great start, good examples and a very nice way to 'crash' into data s!"
9324,Very good for course for beginners in javascript. You need to have some familiarity though with programming in general.
9325,Totally worth taking this course if you intend to improve your negotiation skill from simply hanging and bargaining to true win-win agreements.
9326,Letter than any other cava course.
9327,Great course. Highly recommended
9328,"A very good course that reaches many interesting and surprising things. I admit I was unaware of this material. Completely unaware. Creating beautiful webpages (HTML, CSS), creating and edifying images with JavaScript, encrypting and decrypting images in other images !!! Oooh !!! That an unexpected joy !!! I did not know someone can do such things all by himself. I'm really happy to have gone through this course. One thing. It takes time. I think that the time required that is given in the information about the course is unreal. Anyway I wholeheartedly suggest this course to anyone interested in science, computers, and is energetic enough to absorb this amazing stuff."
9329,"His course, as part of the specialization is really a great start."
9330,Essential knowledge to improve moral values.
9331,The assignment were challenging and cool. Not of self-study needed to crack them. The lecture video could have been a bit more interesting.
9332,amazing course
9333,A very interesting course for beginners and a very good first step in pursuing deeper knowledge. Thank you Edinburgh University and Coursera
9334,"Thanks, teachers. I learned a lot from"
9335,Very interesting material and basic knowledge on R to read files and produce tidy data
9336,really good course
9337,Great overview of R with practical lessons. It was challenging and frustration at times and I learned a lot.
9338,"Not happy about the course. Very very general information. His can be obtained through any internet reading and doesn't require a purchase of the course. 79 dollars is not peanuts for many countries. The lectures often refer to the video which are not part of this course. Examples: PPP valuation has not been part of lectures, but is referred to. Maturity and duration of the bond comparison with the glass of water is referred to, but was not part of the course. For the money - we are getting some shorter version of a bigger course. Not satisfied at all. Must finished all the tests and passed, but not happy. To not recommend to anyone and surely will not buy the next course."
9339,"Very clear, good introduction"
9340,Instructor and textbook do a very nice job of using the student's intuition to explain probability theory
9341,Was able to address all necessary areas with relevant evidences.Excellent learning style/methods employed by the Prof. made the course even more interesting...
9342,His course is good for those people who has never program in Python. But for experience people there is nothing new in this course.I would really appreciate if) the target audience is mentioned in a course it would be really helpful) what a person would achieve after completion of a course .
9343,Awesome course for understanding the foundations of Python Data sir.
9344,"Very interesting course, kept me involved and was very interactive."
9345,"Good into, but a bit outdated and dull."
9346,The lectures are well explained. But the programming exercises are too basic . Expected the programming assignment to be more challenging . Good course but each week could be completed by 2-3 hours . And the 6 week course can be completed within 1 week by casual work . But its a good introduction to access web data using patron . Recommended for beginners .
9347,"I've had to guess a lot of things, video explanations were not up to the level of the assignment (I don't look for easier assignment but broader explanations).the last week assignment on crowdsourcing it's cool but for example Mechanical Turk take 48hrs to validity you before you could start, so if you start the assignment on friday you'll barely make it and if you had time until saturday(because you work) you are doomed."
9348,Great methodology! Interesting content and easy to follow even if the student does not have a strong background.
9349,It's ok for an extremely high-level overview
9350,Very Useful
9351,"Good course, I recommend it!"
9352,just started it and it's great! they make it so simple and appealing love it!
9353,A quintessential course for Genetic students all over the world. Very nicely prepared and elucidate by Or. Marie Blewitt .Any many thanks to Or. Marie Blewitt & Coursera team.
9354,Good stuff.The teacher somehow managed to make accounting interesting.
9355,Amazing course and amazing teacher. North your time to go through the whole courses!
9356,"Great content overall. Some of the lectures are now a bit out of date, but the information is still technically accurate. I'd appreciate a newer version of the lectures, most of which were created in 2011. (The introductory remarks from the professor each week have been updated somewhat).I'd also appreciate the full video for each lecture. Some of the lecture video are cut off quite extensively. A video may say it's 5 minutes in length, but the professor's lecture hasn't ended, and students end up wandering whether the lecture has actually ended. In most cases, as my classmates and I have found, the lecture was not posted in full and we have to go to YouTube to get the full lecture.Other than these two smaller issues, the content and lectures are good quality and a reasonable length for each week. I learned a lot from this course that will help me better understand the world of banking and finance in particular."
9357,"To tackle such key concepts and tools of statistics, you need the appropriate time. Too much material covered in this course. I tend to think that revising the approach to this course as two 4 weeks nodules would allow to both go more in depth at a more appropriate pace."
9358,"His course contains really interesting information, which is presented in a creative way (suitable for the artistic mind of a musician). The lessons can easily be put into practice. I like the discussions because they are very thought provoking and really challenge the students to think of different ways to add more value to their music.And last but not least I like the interviews, because they give some really practical real life advice."
9359,It was a completed course which keeps me learning about 2 months and a half. Congratulations for sharing your acknowledgment about machine learning topics.
9360,I love this course...you get a lot of practice and the instructor explains the theory of things really well.
9361,Excellent opportunity to gain great experience!
9362,excellent course!!but should have more material.Always it was a great experience. Thank you :)
9363,"I really liked this course. It was very interesting and Donald was a really great, enthusiastic teacher. It had some fun quires to keep the lecture video interesting and the content was very helpful and well presented."
9364,"Eye opening and helping to absorb science to enrich the one's thoughts and point of view on the powerful moments of everyday life. Thank you, I loved this course!"
9365,Perfect course
9366,"Great course, I had previous knowledge of Python but it was good to see a different approach with more background behind it."
9367,Would not understand many of the mathematical formula involved. The topic coverage was good.
9368,"Great course with a very charismatic lecturer. The assignment were very challenging which was essential as the majority of learning takes place when actually coming.Thanks,David"
9369,His is the best machine learning MOOC.
9370,"very engaging, and has shown me that incredible content and engaging content do not have to be severe from each other."
9371,Great!
9372,"Excellent, relevant, and updated content and guidance through video and assignment. Of you work hard and use material from previous courses in the specialization you can start to feel how you are getting somewhere. With the technology we learned in this course I feel I can now provide unable products that provide interactivity and promote better understanding of complex data sets."
9373,"Pretty loaded with information on how we got to here technology-wise. Backs on some more in-deep into, even being a introductory course, it could have a bit more into on the state of the art of of."
9374,Great course! I loved every minute of it.
9375,"The materials are wonderfully presented and the instructor are very liable and engaging. However, the quires are very wandering and the course overall is not very challenging."
9376,Very carefully presented and organized introductory course. Well put R support.
9377,Excellent introduction to the Python language. Or. Chuck does a wonderful job introducing new concepts and developing your skill to future application
9378,"I found the course very information and useful. It has taught me to look at objects, landscape etc all at different vantage points and angles."
9379,Wonderful lecturer and fascinating material.
9380,A very good to start with to explore about Python.
9381,It's really helpful course to understand grammar and to improve writing skill.
9382,"His course is absolutely amazing! Super easy to understand and follow! I have learned of much! Thank you, aden!"
9383,Absolutely the most useful course for anyone who is interested in machine learning. The course explains almost common models in a way that even non-statistical background earners can understand with ease.
9384,"I like the Course.When I learn the Course , I get the passion ,patience and sense of achievement."
9385,great experience with great faculties and learning basis with smart ways thank you
9386,I am recommending this class to my advanced high school students. There were too many insight to share.
9387,"The instructor is extremely clear. Very information course to get an introduction to machine learning. The assignment are fairly easy, still some of them require some time."
9388,"His is a wonderful course, no matter what do you know about this subject. I am a chartered psychologist, leading a weekly group to practice Sinfulness through facebook and found the course worth value."
9389,Great
9390,The concept is interesting and the graph is visual.
9391,Have to say: this course is not useful
9392,"His course is excellent, and comprehensive."
9393,Who knew development of medical technology was scrutinized so much. Plus all the factors that are needed to be taken into account.
9394,Good overview of big data and an interesting case study. Would be grade more difficulty.
9395,"Great tips for learning, involving test question after every video to learn the material better. Great overall."
9396,His Course is a Great One! I hope many peoples will improve their knowledge following Vanderbilts University's Courses because of the Professors Great explaining manner!Thank you all
9397,Really Fool for a beginner
9398,Very good start for sentimental analysis
9399,One of the best courses of the track!
9400,Good course. I like it :)
9401,"Very through introduction course, very helpful for those who are preparing for PMP exam ."
9402,"Will now, the course seems to be very good and the flow is also very comfortable to follow"
9403,Very nice introduction to lockup and pilot tables.
9404,I am in the course currently. Very nicely done with a most enthusiastic instructor.
9405,"Of I can understand all of these derivatives, why shall I attend your course? It is not helpful course, especially for persons looking for some practical econometrics applications rather than rousing on the mathematics side of it."
9406,very great course
9407,"Great course, Prof Harris is a great instructor"
9408,"I saw two main issues with this course: 1) dated lecture video, oftentimes with R code that can't be implicated using up-to-date packages, and 2) lack of thoughtful design: example after example after example after example doesn't really teach you anything."
9409,Excellent class! Was not a big fan of online courses; especially technical material but Or Chuck is awesome. To engaging and he really makes the class fun. Really like the bonus video as well as the format. Each chapter/ section broken down into small checks so easier to digest. Small sections was also helpful if because if a certain concept was unclear it was easy to just go back and re-watch or re-read. Highly recommended.
9410,"Insightful course that will remind the student of the critical importance of people in the business, as well as critical best practices. Great course!"
9411,It was an engaging course and I look forward to reading the book!
9412,Great course... instructor was engaging and fun - highly recommend!
9413,Advanced
9414,Well presented material. Good pace of lectures - short but fully understandable. Different instructor (you won't get bored ;)). Very good programming assignment.
9415,I prefer anonymous classmates reviewing.
9416,Interesting course. Thou the entire assignment is bundles up at the end.
9417,Most Effective Course.... Thanks a lot....
9418,The best course I have taken in my life. Thank you very much to From. A and to all his wonderful team.
9419,"Great course, in-depth explanations of mathematical concepts, while walking through them step by step to enhance understanding. Highly recommended."
9420,"Short, but very interesting course. The professor is extremely engaging in the video lectures, I enjoyed listening."
9421,"His course is great. The only thing I'd say is that the prerequisite for this course is really high, much higher than the course is advertised as, and I spent reviewing concepts in linear algebra (for example) almost more or as much as I did spending time on understanding how things work in aerial robotics. Challenging, and I still feel like I barely understand the material (most examples cover the most simple scenario) so this is really just an introduction. However, still very difficult but recommended. Thanks everyone who put this course together."
9422,Would have been more practical.
9423,The course format and reading materials are of very much helped me to have the concept of research design and research formulation. I recommend this course to my fellow earners..
9424,"I, Of you want to create your own videogame programming on unity, this is the first step to get it. Brian Inn is an excellent professor. His course covered all my expectations."
9425,"A nice short course. I would have liked it to go a little more in depth. I don't think it provides more than a simple couture-search could. However, the lecturer is very appealing and incredible. Maybe there should be more in the ""suggested reading"" so people with the interest could add to their knowledge."
9426,Letter than the second one. It should focus more on the specific of the game industry. It provides much generals advice that can be gotten in much better depth in other entrepreneurship content on CourseraI missed a section on what are the main players on the gazing industry and a brief discussion of each
9427,"His course has more interesting material than the previous one (Landscape) but again, the assignment are based on theoretical essays than on practical tasks (case analysis etc)."
9428,was a great course .. thanks
9429,"His course was very enjoyable in learning what sinfulness was to me and better ways to become more mindful in my life. I also found more happiness, joy, and peace from taking this course. I would say overall the best benefit is having less stress from the simple principles covered in this course."
9430,Absolutely fantastic. I was shown many standpoint I have never considered and introduced to useful tips that have given me courage to make the first moves in my venture.
9431,"There is no discussion forum. There are some concepts made me confused and I want to discuss with some other classmates. Another thing is there almost has no example, teacher just say the principles. I think one or two example for a principle may make some concepts more clear and can be understood easier."
9432,It's easy to learn some basic theory from this course. After that we may be able to develop some simple system about of.
9433,to basic
9434,Contents are excellent.The only disappointing is that It costs to submit assignment.
9435,5 stars if the audit from the video would remain at a consistent level and also would be amplified a bit more as i often have it mixed out and still have trouble hearing much of the did content. The content itself is priceless mio. Really excellent tools that you'll use the rest of your life.
9436,"It is indeed a good course, especially because of learning about UNIX and the GPIO pins. I missed reading material, since the video are too short for learning something in a deep way."
9437,West Course for Machine Learning
9438,His is the second course in the Python for Everyone series which continues (and concluded) the introduction to Python. The course's automatic trading made it easy to continue with each assignment at my own pace; and the way the information is presented makes it easy to learn without getting frustrated.
9439,"I've only finished the st week, yet, I can say that LH2L is very effective. By learning abilities have greatly improved. It helps a lot to understand how our brain works for a more effective learning.It is so good that I am going to buy the book ""A Mind for Numbers"". Thanks Barbara Valley, Or. Sejnowski, and everyone else for making this course free and available to everybody :)"
9440,"Great course: fun, interesting, educational, easy to watch...I strongly recommend it! <3"
9441,"Incredible course in every way: Highly competent lectures, excellent video quality in both content and production, great pacing and delivery of information and dozens of links to engaging resource material.One of the best MOOCs I have ever participated in: fun, information and intriguing!"
9442,Great Course to learn how to be familiar with R.
9443,"A logical expansion of the way history should be taught, Fig History starts with the Fig Sang and moves on from there. The historical information is not new but the perspective it encourages provides a way to tie history closer to science and the major events that have changed the universe, our world and human life. To often in history we get caught up in the details. Fig History makes sure that the big picture, and how we fit into it, is always visible."
9444,"this course is amazing the teacher is cool , funny and he explains the class in a really cool way with puppet and stuff and i learned a lot and the best part of all is that it was fun"
9445,"I'll say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization, if you have the skill to complete this course then you don't need to take this course. Of you don't have the skill to complete this course, you will not complete this course. The course instruction is at 10000 feet level and the assignment are very challenging and the course will NOT teach you the skill required to complete the assignment.I recommend the Machine Learning Course (from Will's colleagues) at University of Washington. That is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignment (though still very challenging)."
9446,A very good course if you want to start with machine learning.Provides both theoretical and practical knowledge regarding the different algorithms of machine learning.
9447,"Gives out clear understanding. The choice of reference books are interesting, especially 'The Odour of Chrysanthmums'"
9448,His course progresses extremely slowly but it covers the material as advertised. I recommend this to absolute programming beginners.
9449,a very good introduction to clinical trail
9450,Great course to understand the basis of Data Visualization.
9451,"I learned a lot i did not know,"
9452,"Great course. Excellent lecturer. Very useful, and also fun. Highly recommendation."
9453,There is a pretty big jump from the content to actually completing the assignment. The assignment are not well signed with the will learning or the video. There is no logical process taught about how to move forward if you get stuck. It often means a student is forced to search the internet and hope the answer they find is appropriate so they can write their own code.
9454,Of you want to recall your English Grammar - you have to take this course!
9455,Great!
9456,It was very well organized and structures course. Thoroughly enjoyed it!
9457,Its a great start point with great emphasis on introduction to what to come!
9458,"I did an audit only, but the lectures were excellent for the level of understanding I was aiming for. I thought the analogies were well understood, and the presentations were easy to follow and interesting. Both lectures made it easy to focus on the material and there weren't many things to distract the learner (i.e. no distracting background or awkward speech). Very well done, I think."
9459,Hated the course and the content. I truly regret investing my money on this course.
9460,Great course.
9461,I am giving a 5 starts because I really enjoyed the course and I learned a lot. but to be honest I almost gave up. The programming assignment is a little bit frustration since there is really not help and not much guidance.
9462,Enjoyed this. Lots of lectures by guest authors.
9463,"The course content is great. However, basic knowledge of patron programming language is required. Since I didn't know patron coming rules, I really struggled for a while. Maybe, basis of patron in additional resources will help a lot of earners."
9464,Well organised.Good Clarity of Concepts. Thank you Professor.
9465,Great course going into important details on cost and fidgeting. I really like the video portion which gives real-world examples that help reinforce and bring the concepts to an everyday audience.
9466,"Professor Fowler is an excellent teacher, and The Ohio State knows it."
9467,Good introduction into Peter. The Face is good and the instruction is engaging. The last assignment can be a bit tricky for the challenges.
9468,"Good narrator, solid into course in LTE"
9469,"His course is amazing. Really clear, information, and hands-on. The content does not get too begged down with complex details, and really gives a great overview of many of the most used machine learning algorithms and machine learning applications."
9470,the most information and most structures out of all Creative Writing Specialization courses so far. Thank you!
9471,Pretty cool!
9472,"""Grammar and Punctuation"" was an excellent course. The instructor made the concepts so easy to understand and practice. His course is highly recommended! Deep up the great work!"
9473,clear and concise course
9474,"Good. However, I need more detail and advanced exercise."
9475,Must great! I really likes assighnemts with API and I would like to practice them more!
9476,"It is not clear enough for a greenhand to understand, especially about installing It on Sac or pushing files to Github."
9477,West course and nice explicationthank you .
9478,His is a great course! Last paced and information.
9479,It's a very interesting and interactive course. I recommend it a lot!
9480,"Javascript & HTML are covered nicely for a 3 week course & enables us to learn anything new from the web on our own.The course lacks in the coverage of CSS (Hence the 4 stars & not 5).The final project was very nice & interesting, so much so that I have been developing it further & have added many more features to it."
9481,"Definitely not for a beginner.Wish there were more visual, and assignment to do alongside the professor. Instead, it is a lecture from Power Joints, that don't really line up with the assignment very well.Of you have previous knowledge in another language, you'll do fine, but if you're truly looking for a beginner course, look elsewhere. Any assumptions are made by this professor that makes it less unapproachable by a beginner, IMO."
9482,"His was a great MOOC, thank you for sharing your knowledge on the topic Amy. I am looking forward to taking your next class in the series."
9483,Very useful to put in practice some of the learning obtained
9484,"The information is good, but basic. Even at the reduced price, it seems prices and this information could be rolled into another course."
9485,In amazing learning experience from an amazing teacher!
9486,"I am a glad student and I am still learning how to learn. His course has been very information and I have used it to analyze my own learning routine, and hopefully, improve! Barbara is very clear and concise and I enjoyed herlectures and the material."
9487,Very information and progress work for students.
9488,Great course which bring to us improvements in our way studying.
9489,Simply Good!
9490,"The course is really interesting, but I believe the professor approach to describe and explain the topics is really confusing. I had to search other resources to clarify the topics."
9491,"fabulous course with lot of do's and don'to... and an inspiration guide and technique for a started writer or a begin. course with its full content , quality and knowledge ."
9492,"His is a very good introduction course. It's easy to follow, it's explicative and offers extra resources to complement the contents and deep."
9493,Great course! Provided a lot of insight and helpful tips! I followed this course after I switched jobs and started working in the Learning and Development area. I believe every student should follow this course because it will help them in their studies!
9494,"His is the first time I have finished an online course, and after this I feel I am able to do more. Yakov's presentation makes it possible for me to finish it (while taking care of a baby!). The teaching material is well organised, step by step. For each topic, the theory is clearly presented first( but just enough to start an example) and then explained by coming examples. A brief summary of the theory will be made at the end so you get a chance to re-think about it. And since this course is about a framework, he doesn't just show you how to use it, but also explains how some functionalities are achieved by the framework. He even tries to explain why uses this framework, or any framework at all in the beginning, which may seem obvious but actually not, at least according to my experiences. Also, a most fun and brilliant part of this course is that he uses various kinds of ""he loves colonies"" examples throughout this course. They are REALLY fun and catching!"
9495,Great course to start with Of printing technology.
9496,His course gives a really good guide on how to define data science questions correctly and how to work with sharp goals during the hole Data Analysis funnel from the definition of the Data Science question to the communication of it's results.
9497,His case is so thoughtful and information. Really makes you think.
9498,"Its a very good course, easy to understand and good explanations and resources all through"
9499,I found this course very Informative and it took me from knowing nothing to having a knowledge that can be built on. T Hogarth presented the course in a way even I could understand .All in all a course well worth taking
9500,"Very thorough, educational, and very enjoyable. Highly recommended."
9501,"Very interesting course with some practical tips on how to improve your learning process better. I wish I had done this code when I was in school or when I flogged during my glad school, but better late than never!"
9502,His course helped me a lot to write better.
9503,"very bad, useless course. Must listing the names of the methods and practices."
9504,"Very helpful course, fun and easy to understand. I have already put into practice"
9505,Excellent. The subject is clearly and concisely produced and delivered; the reading are spot on. North every minute.
9506,"Is far as I know, this course is unique: it is the only one that lets you build your knowledge of modeling climate change by building your own models. I'm giving it 4, not 5, as the forms are very quiet. Prof. Cher has done a great job of providing infrastructure so students can focus on the physics. Assessment is a combination of a grade, to check your code in particular cases, peer review, and quires that will be easy if you code works. You can probably bluff your way through the quires, but it's easier to get your code working and then read off the answers to the questions. Beer reviews also give you a chance to see how other students have solved the problems."
9507,"very good course, what interesting to me is the evaporation on the real world applications during this course."
9508,"Thanks for all the support, without their help, would not have been able to study at an institution of high quality. Thanks Coursera and U. Michigan"
9509,"I had previously learned some of this material in previous courses I had taken years ago in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence, however this course provided a much better explanation on how and why these technique work. The concise presentation style of the mathematics, the inclusion of system design in the syllabus, and the construction of the practical exercises (using Atlas) were all very well done and much appreciated."
9510,Excellent course provided by prof. McGready. I recommend it to everyone who wants to start a solid background for biostatistics.
9511,The best course in web design you could find anywhere in the world. Absolutely brilliant.
9512,Very easy. Not worth the money it requests.
9513,"Very interesting course, it helped me to learn how to learn (as would be ridiculous as it may sound :)). Thanks to the University of California An Diego for the given course."
9514,Moved this course. Allows you to go into more detail if you wish. Friendly lecturer. Fascinating subject.
9515,A poor end to a poor Coursera specializations.
9516,"His is a very good course, let me learn a lot of business skill, thank you!"
9517,"Nurse was clear, and well presented via Coursera. Certain lectures do great over the net, some not so ... this professor was very well prepared for the course content, give in shorter lectures with intermittent questions to keep you engaged. simple, effective."
9518,The best
9519,"It's good to start an algorithm of graph implementation. Except the first Assignment, the next following assignment are a little bit tough for me."
9520,Very good series for learning Cava and of Principles. The big application approach is very interesting as we can see the whole picture even when we know little yet. The interviews with software engineers are very enlightening.
9521,Excellent broad exposure to many things which have changed significantly since I saw them in the past.
9522,West Robotics class ever
9523,Very useful. I have learned a lot of english and technique for make a business plan!
9524,A pleasure to have learned under such accomplished writers and teachers. Thank you. A beautifully well conducted course.
9525,Moved the course - just know this is not a programming introduction class; you need to have some C# skill before beginning!
9526,The lecturer is amazing!
9527,Great course for beginners!!!
9528,It's a very nice course and make email writing very clear and easy. Thanks!
9529,Excellent course and great material!
9530,I learned so much about the South that I didn't already know.
9531,In interesting course to follow and apply.
9532,"I give this course a 5-star review. The learning strikes a perfect balance between challenging one's limits and being relaxed and enjoyable. I feel relaxed in the course, but at the same time I feel like it's always 1% beyond my reach, which really pushes me to work harder! It stretches my own limitations and encourages me to expel, without being too much to handle. I think that this course belongs amongst the top elite courses offered by Coursera. Bravo!"
9533,Vice course! Simply about complicated.
9534,Thank you to the professors who made this course possible and especially to Or. Men who was willing to spend some time with us face to face via video. I found the course very challenging but at the same time I did learn quite a bit about R. Working through the course assignment and the final project was the best part. By rating is 4 stars because the course lectures are not engaging. The lecture style is basically just reading the sides to us and they don't take much time to explain what is going on.
9535,"His is a great course for someone who wants to improve his basic learning technique, understand the science behind learning and implement good learning habits and be a better learner"
9536,Very well done online course. Thank you.
9537,"Great course, It is very information and fun to learn. I love the fact that I can watch the video on-the-go. And I learned a lot about food and eating. Great job! Thanks!!"
9538,"more mathematical depth would be great, video are too concise"
9539,His is a good start up course to learn about fingering fundamentals.
9540,His course did what it said it was going to do. I feel more confident in my teaching ability and am walking away with a notebook full of understanding and ways to incorporate my learning into my eighth grade science classroom! Thank you for hearing this course to educators! It was quite benefit
9541,Good introduction
9542,Very interesting course and very information and practical
9543,The Bluemix video wa a bit confusing and my promo code didn't work and I never received a reply on how to get it to work.
9544,Awesome course great professor
9545,"Must finished this course, absolutely amazing experience."
9546,I am able to focus and work more effectively. Thank you so much
9547,Good explanation of the concepts. Need commitment
9548,"very nice,easy to understand and useful"
9549,"It's a course that will develop your capacity of watch the company's decisions for a theoretical way, and be able to understand their choice.These decisions will be needed for a sustainable firm."
9550,Enjoyed the lessons very much !!
9551,"Very useful course for getting started in R Programming. I would advise to take this course for everyone, who is interested in working with data. I had a pleasure to complete the tasks and to get knowledge about new things! Thank you!"
9552,"Fig compliment to Or. Chuck and his team for the great course ""Programming for Everybody, getting started with Python"". Feels like a face to face course. Love the way Or. Chuck explains the patterns of programming."
9553,"Excellent, brilliant course))) To many useful information)) thank u))"
9554,Very information course
9555,"Good instructions, clearly taught"
9556,"I started my journey of machine learning from this course ,the course is excellent, and I've leaned a lot idea and skill from this course"
9557,"I base my rating of courses on 3 things:1) Is the material clear? 3/Eyes, for the most part, though the lecturer sometimes gets mixed up and uses terms like ""class"" / ""object"" the wrong way.2) An I generalized from the material to other applications? 2/His module spends a lot of time on C before you get to Objective-C specific material, so you don't get much Objective-C. There's a bit of a tour of rode, but it's not particularly comprehensive. The apes you build are incredibly basic, and there's no real discussion of how to generalized from them.3) Is the course presented in an engaging way? 1/His course is super boring. Of you already know C, a lot of the content is a waste of time, but I imagine that if you don't know C this is not a good way to pick it up.To overall 2/One other thing - the assignment are grade in a pretty bizarre way. You have to take a screencap video of your code and your pp in action, unload the video, and then wait for another person to knoll in the course and review your submission. In return, you have to review three other people's video. Sort of a rolling homework Ponzi scheme. His strikes me as a system that could be greatly improved upon!"
9558,"Great quick course to introduce concepts that everybody should be familiar with, really easy to follow."
9559,"Interesting, simple and useful course"
9560,I never thought this course could be this helpful!! Thanks and keep up the good works.
9561,"The design of the course is great with lectures, interviews, and project assignment. I was able to reflect on my past experience and learn better. The only improvement I could think of is related to the delivery of the lectures. It could be more natural. They sounded like they were reading instead of securing."
9562,His was very detailed course on Diabetes
9563,"Very interesting and nice, but too short!"
9564,"Thanks you, thank you and thank you! Completing this course has been an amazingly enriching experience for me. It is not only about learning additional tool and technology but also a life changing event in my case as it gives me a new hope to think of machine learning as a very promising career option. Prof G has been so very kind to share his knowledge through this course. The course has been very well developed. The hands on assignment especially are so well structures that I felt as if a physical trainer is holding my hand and taking me through solving some of the difficult examples. His course is an example of how an online course should be. I am glad I came across this course. I thank Prof G and his team behind this course and wish them good luck."
9565,"I thought this course was very well done. The video lectures were very interesting, and the links to additional reading and video was very welcome. Definitely one of the strongest segments of the creative writing specializations."
9566,Great teacher
9567,shame you have to pay for this course although the content is good
9568,course starts to be already outdated
9569,A really great prime for a very vast topic. Awesome!
9570,Wonderful course I have ever taken. THIS is great effort by the University ..verruca userfriendly.I regiment all the earners who wants to know much on c and criminal law must be follow this course.Highly recommend.Regards.Sasantha sameeraSri Vanka
9571,"Very useful introduction to the topic! His is a course accessible for all, but at the same time it is very rich in the information supplied."
9572,need more engagement and exercises before every week task
9573,It was a great course and had good hands on materials. Now for the theoretical underpinnings!
9574,i am getting the hang of it and liking my progress so far. it is really helpful
9575,Great course. I have often wondered what was wrong with me. His course helped me to better understand myself and others.
9576,"In interesting overview, but I wish it had been a bit more vigorous."
9577,"I found this a really interesting course to complete. The lectures are easily digestive and help to provide context for various reading that you complete along the way. I would have liked an introductory lecture that gave an overview of some of the major themes of the course more clearly (I felt a bit at sea throughout the first topic having never studied this before. I didn't know what to pay attention to). But once we were underway, I had no trouble working out the flow of events. I really enjoyed this- thank you!"
9578,"It is good if you are looking for basic information, I did not finish the entire course, I think it was not right for me."
9579,A bit 'light' on content but ok for an introduction.
9580,Very detailed lectures help me to understand in pp development a lot. Thank you :-)
9581,His course is too broad and specific to USA.
9582,"I've always been wondering how people make circuits work the way they want it to, and now it no longer puzzled me! Thanks guns for your work on this great lecture!"
9583,Very useful
9584,It is a little bit hard for the newby of astronomy. But I do learn a lot from your course. It is quite interesting. Thank you.
9585,Outstanding. I'd never thought I'd be able to produce some results in such short time.His course opened my eyes on many things. I'll love explore Unity Of
9586,Had teaching quality.
9587,Really nice course.
9588,Great course. Huge amount of content. Lectures are easy to listen to. He sure to allow enough time for the reading and major assignment. The reading take much longer than indicated.
9589,Thank You Than Gutta! You are the best ever lecturer i ever had.Thank You for the golden knowledge you have passed on to me.
9590,Great job!
9591,"Thanks for this wonderful session on Getting and Leaning Data. I would like to convey my sincere thanks to Professors Roger D. End, Brian D. Jaffa and Jeff Week and my fellow earners for their excellent help in completing the project to generate Tidy dataset. I would like to name Or. Suis Landing for his help and effort in putting a help Guide for this assignment. I followed it and got the assignment completed. The step by step procedure helped me and other fellow earners to complete the assignment on time.Though this course is over, still we have the doubt on the dimension of the tidy dataset, whether it is 180 by 68 or 180 by 88 as the total number of ""mean' variable considered are varying. Request senators or was to help us arrive at the correct dimension and help us understand the reason behind the same.His course has witnessed the need for support from was and senators. Their help and support was very valuable in understanding the subject.Thanks to Coursera, my Professors, senators and was of this course for their insight, guidance, support and effort.Wishing Coursera and Professors all the best and Success.The SWIRL component for learning the subject is the best and wish SWIRL support for all the heavy courses. Special thanks to those who made SWIRL course material possible for Data Scientist's toolbox.With West Wishes,S. Ramalakshmanan"
9592,The overall course was very useful.However some topics I found difficulty to understand the idea even after repeating the video 3 times.
9593,"Clear, simple but engaging.The three lessons about R have been a fun.I'm looking forward to start the next session."
9594,Totally useful!
9595,"Excellent introduction to the subject, good course to follow before diving deeper into Same Theory (as I plan to do). Small problems when showing images but nothing that ruins the experience. Or. Michihiro Candor is a great teacher!"
9596,"It's good for my life, thanks this team!"
9597,Great way to start developing fast and in a responsive way !
9598,Great course!!!
9599,Very useful.
9600,"The best course I have done on Coursera. The authors have put together a great set of lectures and especially programming assignment, which really force you to think about what you are doing rather than go by trial and error. That's more, you can submit these in about a dozen commonly used programming languages so you can practise the language of your choice while learning about algorithms. Highly recommended!"
9601,Interesting learning the basis of Data science. Very information
9602,Great introduction into the subject!
9603,"Excellent Course, must be for all people, interested in exercising this domain."
9604,One of the well organized and information course for beginners.
9605,Very interesting to find out about luxury bands.
9606,"His course is fussing on negotiation in business.But the presented concepts and strategics can be used in private negotiations of all kinds.I found the legal aspects of negotiation of contracts rather boring, but then you can watch the video in double speed.All in all a very useful course for me."
9607,Insightful course that provided a concise overview of pricking strategics.
9608,Very well structures course with good pacing.
9609,"Excellent course. The material presented was not difficult to comprehend. I highly recommend this to parents who are in a quand every night when the question, ""what's for dinner?"" presents itself. More than the content, I was most impressed by the manner in which the course was taught. Instead of a ""talking head"" format, the instructor used a variety of technique to present the material, including teaching the majority of the class from her kitchen, using an interactive ""blackguard"" to illustrate concepts while she spoke and lots of cooking demonstrations. Buds to Stanford for producing such high quality content. I have started a lot of Coursera courses and this is the first one that I've been able to complete because the content kept me engaged."
9610,Great introduction!
9611,Not of emphasis on remembering things rather than understanding how they work.
9612,"Course is good. I'd like to see more code assignment, because the hands basis should be studied in more details, IMHO."
9613,"His is the kind of Angular course i was looking for,every other course i enrolled in,i found that they aren't really explaining what is going on under the hood, this course is certainly doing that which helped me understand important concepts to deepen my understanding. Thank you so much for this gem."
9614,"Learning technique this course introduced to me are extremely amazing, and I think i will apply them all to my study and life. Thank you very much."
9615,"His course (as the previous one) needs some improvements. First learning only relying on video is not very effective. There are no lecture sides neither consistent additional resources to grasp seriously the materials. Also the way quires are designed is not - in my opinion, very well planned. The video alone do not give consistent background to approach seriously the quires. Also - again in my opinion, I didn't saw a consistent approach to the materials, neither the examples given made any sense. In the last video, there is a mention to the business world and how to apply this savior relief approach, but in contrast the video and examples show as examples a situation extreme with an avalanche, use the HEC MBA program as example. I simply don't see how this can relate with the business world as a consistent comparison. I think you should reflect on this."
9616,"Great information from the lectures and great photo's of the Arctic, the free downloadable book is an extra bonus and helps with the quit questions, well done Merry and team.."
9617,Awesome!! Even for a History major like myself it was incredibly thought provoking and extremely well taught. I only wish every American received this level of instruction on The Constitution.
9618,Thanks a lot. I love the course.
9619,It is a good introductory course for SQL.
9620,Great way to start learning history.
9621,Simply great!!
9622,Very good teacher ! Clear and short lessons and very useful exercises. Thank you
9623,at time the formula are given without proof or intuition explanations. overall a good basic level course
9624,"¡of CURSO MAGNÍFICO INFINITAS GRACIAS A LOS TUTORES! of INFORMACIÓN PROPORCIONADA of EXCELENTE of of AYUDADO A ENRIQUECER MIS CONOCIMIENTOS, of CERO CONOCIMIENTOS AHORA TENGO MUCHAS HERRAMIENTAS PARA AFRONTAR of SITUACIÓN CATASTRÓFICA. SIGAN ADELANTE CON ESTA MARAVILLOSA LABOR PARA of PÚBLICO of DIFERENTES PAÍSES.¡FELICIDADES !"
9625,"Excellent course for people for whom English is not their mother tongue! Very well paced.The course also provides a good insight on what journalism is suppose to be, its principles and values!"
9626,"Although classified as an introductory course, the material is very complete and comprehensive."
9627,The course was good and the material was interesting. I wish that the course were more video-based however. There are some video but they are meant to be played at specific points during the reading.
9628,The concepts are explained in best way so that even the layman can understand it and use it in his daily life and be secured
9629,The th week content is hard to follow than the previous three. It would be better if more detailed path and examples are provided in the th week.
9630,good for mechanical engineers
9631,"Is a started, this course is an wonderful learning opportunity. You get to know everything from basis."
9632,Good course! Learned from others.
9633,"Great and very information, definitely recommend to everyone who would like to learn more about of or change career into Human resources."
9634,His is the best online course for Ruby on Nails I have ever seen so far.
9635,"Overall, I liked being exposed to Github and GitBash. I felt this course gave me a broad overview of what to expect in the future!"
9636,The teacher is nice. Thank you
9637,Interested in poetry. His will fall in love with the art of writing poetry! 100%
9638,"It's really fantastic! Learning in this course is like travelling by a time machine, and the professor leads you to know every teaching approach in detail. I like this course!"
9639,Really interesting course! I recommend it to anyone interested in game theory! :)
9640,"Links to 4 year old articles, webster and TED talks that can be found on Google don't really constitute a course to me sorry."
9641,"A good course on the basis of neuromarketing, but the tests are very simple. Thank you very much for your work"
9642,Is consultant this course was very useful to understand how data analyst consultant works.
9643,His course was really awesome and helped a lot to revise old concepts as well as learn many new things about the data structures
9644,His course was an extremely helpful introduction to programming. I have no background in this area but I found the pace and material appropriate for my level. I would encourage anyone interested in Python to knoll in this course.
9645,Great and essential for every business manager.
9646,"I started this course early and was so excited to learn this new information I just dove right in! Unfortunately I am too far ahead and have to wait a few weeks until I can take my week 2 quit. Instead of tinge watching Netflix at night I get my nightly dose of Positive Psychology! I recommended this course too all of my friends, family and co-workers."
9647,A worthwhile course that breaks down methods for doing initial data analysis to get a rough feel of the data. It provides enough useful information about the 3 clotting systems in R and how they differ to allow the student to do sufficient exploration on his or her own.
9648,"While this wasn't what I was expecting, Learning Now To Learn is definitely worth the time and effort"
9649,The whole course was nicely designed. Course material was taught in a simple and entertaining way. It did not get boring and was taught in a succinct manner. I loved it :-)
9650,I'm going trough week 6 of the course and with little to no background in path and programming i was able to keep on through the lectures and exercises and truly feel that i am learning pretty nice things about machine learning
9651,"His course is the most interesting course I've done. It has so many faces and different topics, yet a clear line of thought. The lectures are interesting and the assignment helpful. I would recommend this to everyone... who is ready for his/her ideas and beliefs to be shaken up !"
9652,Short yet nice :)
9653,I really love this programme. Well structures and in a very logical sequence. All the tips are f
9654,"The course is very well organized. The concepts explained are basic, but fundamental to understand micro-investment decisions and they are explained in a very clear way: every concept is undermined by a series of example from actual macroeconomic situations, which help to better grass the theory.Also the balance between the duration of the course and the theory explained is very good."
9655,this course answer to a lot of question to my current venture into an online business interest
9656,A very information course
9657,stay cool Or.Chuck
9658,Great instructor and course material is amazing. I've really enjoyed every single step in this course :)
9659,"I like the course, and I learn a lot (having plenty of experience already). However, the assignment take far more time than the quoted 30 minutes, and a lot of time is spent installing and getting open-source tools to work - which I would have rather spent on actually hands on work on the subject-matter."
9660,It is an excellent course!
9661,"Give weeks in and this is one of the best courses going, His is a course every potential animal carer should take before considering 'cut' and 'expensive' just because they come with a certificate of emigree with names one can't pronounce of prize winning ancestry. Drive past the puppy and kitten factories and go down to ones local RSPCA centre or council pound instead, you will never regret it. Rescue animals are the best because they will never forget your kindness for giving them a nice comfortable home."
9662,"very interesting and novice friendly, however some path (basic matrix calculus and derivatives) review worth doing"
9663,"Having no experience in saber security, this course is helping me understand the basis of saber security so that I may advance in Saber forensics. I highly recommend it."
9664,"I love this program. The content is amazing, well done, well prepared, concise, well explained... I love all the courses of this University!!"
9665,I can't have my certificate and already I pay for it!
9666,"Really enjoyed the course - I did well, but this is really in-depth material. I feel like it would be really difficult to implement an of repression algorithm from scratch in a job material.I would like to see more interactivity in the lectures (short-quires interspersed in the video) in addition to the long programming assignment at the end of the course.-Thomas"
9667,Excellent course! Will recommend to anyone that requires a basic+ understanding of machine learning algorithms.
9668,Excellent course for all WASH professional
9669,"That struck me the most was the fact that some of the concepts that are taught in this course are things a lot of people are already doing on a unconscious level. It really helped me look at things like this from a different perspective.While you could argue that some of the examples and metaphor that are used by Or. Valley are a had childish for older students, they get the point across very well.The book pretty much covers the course material and in that sense, I don't consider it a necessary purchase. Having said that, it helps to read through it to help you solidity the things that are taught in this course.Thank you to everyone that helped for these life long lessons and sparkling my interest in neuroscience!"
9670,It needs some previous experience with Python and if possible with Hands
9671,Great Course!
9672,That I've watched wasn't as what I expected.I would give it 2 out of 5 as addressing my needs.
9673,"Excellent beginner course as many tasks in life are mind projects...some not so mind... Time-bound, unique deliverables organized in a way to keep all slaveholders informed along the way."
9674,Thank you for this course. it was very interesting
9675,That's one of the best courses ever i passed. I strongly recommend to take the whole course for further earners. Good luck everyone who is going to take exactly these courses.
9676,Fantastic course and really complete about repression.
9677,Good tips!
9678,Interesting. Sometimes a little bit overwhelmed by a lot of information within a single video but it gives you an overview of what is big data modeling and management systems.
9679,It was a very useful course! thanks a lot
9680,"I'd like to give just one star rating for this course, as it is very far from what I expected. The course expect students to know Python, to know R, but did not go deep enough to help students understand the insight from social media data. In fact, lots of R task can be replaced with Python, so the course could be designed in a much better way that students do not always switch between two programming environment. His course mainly reaches how to download data with keywords, and how to plot graph, not worth the effort of learning. Therefore, I would not recommend this course to anyone."
9681,Great into to machine learning! Intrigue my passion for diving deeper into this field! Thanks Andrew!
9682,"Absolutely information course, super well explained and nice to study. Moved it!"
9683,"I am already using the information i learned from this . I encourage every parent to take this course , Thank you,"
9684,Good one. Nicely paced. Necessary challenge included..
9685,Really helpful course for starting coming apes with Swift.
9686,I helped me a lot how to play and i think i have improved a little bit.Thank you so much Mary Button and the Coursera team.
9687,A very information course. I realized that I still got LOTS to learn to things that I love to do. The teacher is great. Reaching made easy. To need to pay expensive sessions. Salute to course and Berklee!
9688,"A long course compared to others in the specialization, but a lot of great material. Very well presented, the instructor know how to present this material and make it easy to grasp and understand."
9689,I really liked the Expel tools Professor On used. The material covered was very useful as well.
9690,"very nice and practical introduction into Chinese, tax :)"
9691,"The course it's great , however in my opinion it's too theoretical with few practical examples.Of you're comfortable with marines and mathematics this course will provide you with very interesting tools and demonstrations.I don't think that the course is for casual students, as it's very specific."
9692,"Andrew is an amazing teacher, this course cover the basis of of. 100% recommendable"
9693,Excellent course! I thoroughly enjoyed it.
9694,"Professor G enhanced this course with many practical, real-world examples that we can all relate to. He also focused on ""how to intact"" things before diving into the details. The Atlas/Active laws were useful and it was fun to see my ""handwritten digit classified"" process images and correctly identify the digits."
9695,"I am a very frustrated learner trying to write a constructive review here. I studied the course full time to get a certificate to put in my profile. R programming is considered nearly essential skill, if not fundamental, to data analysis. To I had high hopes going into this course.Lecture video: I cannot begin to tell you how many times I fell asleep watching the video lectures. His course is for you if you like listening to someone talking through pages and pages of copy/paste text from a command prompt. I, on the other hand, prefer learning by doing. Badly, all the doing is clamped into the assignment (more on them later). Also, Or. Men makes gross burning/drooping noise in the video from time to time. I apologize if that sounded rude, but try listening to the lectures with headphones and you'll say the same. Video editing for pre-recorded video is not rocket science.Assignment: These were the biggest frustration throughout the course. Imagine you want to learn to play the piano (and you play a little guitar now) and you go to the piano class. Your piano teacher talks your ears off with music theory for several hours and then hangs you out to dry in front of an audience in a concert hall. You protest ""But I have no clue of how to PLAY"", but your teacher says ""All the piano great learned by middling around with a ""packer"" mentality"". You ask ""Why did I pay $50 to hack on my own?""Off-lecture help: Of you take the course for the same reason I did, then thank your favorite god for the operators in the discussion forms (senators). 1 out of the 2 stars I give belongs solely to them and the fantastic work they do. The sticking posts in the forms offer a bit of help with the assignment (not enough, but still something). And they are also active in answering questions. The other star in my review goes to ""Will"". You will learn way more by doing the will exercises than watching the lectures by a long way.In conclusion, I finished the course with nothing more than a rudimentary understanding of R despite the fine grades. Very little thought seems to have been put into the lectures. I would recommend this only if you want to show this certificate to someone. Otherwise, stay away!"
9696,good course
9697,"By congratulations for this course. Was a great experience to learn about this topic and the important for our future.Additionally, i would like to make some suggestions especially related with approach on developed countries, developing countries and the data state.Inside these aspects should be included examples related with Latin America, Asia and another regions that not been included between the classic examples of developed countries.Thanks for this course."
9698,Fantastic course! Really comprehensive yet easy and pleasant to follow.Must a minor comment - I'd like that review criterion were more specific beforehand - I actually had lower grades in a couple of assignment due to review items that only showed up after submission.
9699,Fantastic class!
9700,Thanks a lot.
9701,Awesome lectures! Awesome explanations! Awesome examples! Awesome assignment!
9702,Great insight by the professor!
9703,"By opinion:Not much monitoring of the forms by senators\instructor, hence responses are non- extent\delayed\misleading. some of the replies by senators were misleading, The rational of the Bolt-see balance was not set out very clearly, The expression evaluation is very temperamental, i had to enter the expressions many times , a very time-consuming & frustration process."
9704,"His is not an Introduction but a Review of Machine Learning methods used in Handed.Probably, you have to multiply estimated required time by 10 to really understand lecture topics.Angle competition at the end makes the course really interesting.but:""A theory that you can't explain to a bartender is probably no damn good.""-- Ernest Rutherford"
9705,"It is a really cool course, and i'm starting to really enjoy it, especially because of the explanations brought by the professor and also the difficulty on the quires with doesn't show where you were wrong. with means you'll review almost everything if you are ensure about your answers. thank you for giving us this great opportunity !"
9706,The course is really great to start coming and develop interest in it. The language used is quite simple which makes it easy to understand for almost anyone. Thanks Coursera for the course.
9707,Very helpful. Simple tools to increase personal work efficiency.
9708,"Interesting things about graph also, but I think the content should be more challengingEspecially the last two weeks, a quick quite and a free assignment the automatically give full grade whatever the content"
9709,really eye opening fun and education
9710,"Excellent course, very information and well presented"
9711,"Financial Markets presented in a Layman's language neither had any prior knowledge of financial markets, nor had any idea of stocks and bonds etc. But the course sailed through all these wagons so easily that this market parlance seems cakewalk to me now. The course was presented in such a light way , I felt it's like I am within a story"
9712,"Provides information from basic laws of inheritance to understanding the field of Evolutionary biology and become sequencing. Explained in a 'light and easy to understand' way! Not a course you can pass by knowing a few facts about the subjects. Tricky at times, which help you find out if you understood everything correctly. Would recommend to others!"
9713,Fantastic course. Highly information. Very clear explanations. Excellent overview into all aspects of machine learning.
9714,Thank you. Your team did a wonderful job. I am greatly appreciative.
9715,A wonderful course! I learned so much about Buddhist and meditation.
9716,May over my head but hope to keep working at it.
9717,"To far this has been great, and I'm very excited about knowing mo"
9718,Perfect!
9719,"Seemed more introductory, here are the tools - go have fun rather than actually teaching teaching"
9720,"The articles that were limited were actually somewhat helpful. The goose hangouts seemed lackluster and draining. I would recommend more substance in the video, or MoMA might switch to an article/book MOOC that doesn't rely as much as people talking about their opinion without a ton of evidence or support. Wouldn't recommend participating in this MOOC"
9721,good basic class
9722,A wonderful course and one that I would (and will) recommend to anyone staring any learning journey! Of you are planning on beginning a learning journey - it makes sense to pack your bag with the best tools and technique to make that journey productive and fun!That's what this course does! It equip you to make the most of your time and effort in Coursera and elsewhere.Take this course first - learn the technique - visit and review.
9723,By far my favorite in the specialization so far. His course takes every student immediately from beginner to intermediate novice. Easily the best course I've taken on Coursera so far.
9724,Good introduction
9725,Very hands-on course. Instructor won't teach everything. Students need to do some search on the internet to complete the assignment. It is not that easy but quite rewarding!
9726,"Excellent course. Extremely educational and information. Thank you for sharing, wish the team all the very best."
9727,"Too easy, but is a good beginning for states."
9728,"Very good course, solid structure and right balance between theory and practice.Recommended!"
9729,Very good introduction course with easy to follow examples.
9730,"I like it, it`s useful and easy to follow . only need PDF transcribe to download."
9731,"His is a really great course. The teacher makes it a passionate, interesting and, above all, friendly experience.One of the most complete and thorough courses I've found on this topic."
9732,it was fantastic .
9733,Good introduction course providing nice overview of topics to be seen more in detail in the remaining of the specialization.
9734,Amazing and fascinating course. The instructor is a treasure to find. I feel blessed to have stumbled upon this course with an instructor with such a rich history and knowledge of the South. I recommend to any and everyone who loves history and folklore alike. I wish there were a way to down load the video. His is a great archive of quite possibly my own ancestry. I absolutely loved this course.
9735,"Absolutely loved this course. Warning: it's not really aimed at beginners. You probably want to do Andrew G's Machine Learning course first, play around with the ideas a bit, and then have a go at this one.In terms of style, this course feels a bit like a 'research level' course at a university. That is, the lectures cover a lot of material, at quite a high level. To get the most out of it, you're going to have to sit down after the course and spend some time coming up the ideas. Though I think that's a bonus.In terms of presentation, I thought the lectures were pretty clear and engaging. The course is originally from 2012, and covers material that was cutting edge at the time - including results that were still published. I'd love to see an updated version of this course."
9736,His course is awesome !
9737,Awesome Course !!
9738,Awesome course for beginners. Explanation with examples are really good and easily understandable.
9739,Well taught course which does as it says and introduces the fundamentals of programming using the patron language.
9740,very useful！
9741,"His was a good course, but a bit elementary."
9742,Really useful and dynamic. Moved this first part and I'm looking forward to the next installment.
9743,I really loved this course on agile because it introduces Persons and user stories in enough detail to get started. Heedless to say the video are pleasant to watch and the materials are very comprehensive. I didn't subscribe for the certificate because I won't be applying agile to software design.Great job!
9744,"Would not follow very easily. Confused, gained nothing from the lectures. Really no substance to it."
9745,"Enjoyed learning, look forward to learning more! Thank you!"
9746,It's a very good beginners class. The lectures are quite thorough and well-suited to those who are auditing the class.
9747,Great Course!!
9748,DetailedEngagingThe assignment need thought and effort - makes you learn
9749,"I used to program back in high school in C++, but as the time passed, I forgot a lot of things and this course helped me recall basic logic and functions of programming. I'm a marine biologist now, and I am interested in using various programs for modeling and data analysis, and I feel I am on the right track learning the Python language."
9750,Very interesting course! Learned some useful things too!
9751,"It is a fantastic course that takes the audience through the world of teach's (media platforms) economics and law concepts and regulations. Studying the emergence of Microsoft, Google, Apple and many others, each module is built starting from the ""historical artifacts"" that either first acknowledged or regulated each of them and then slowly bringing them to today's modern standpoint.From my point of view, Bandy Wicker and his team did a great job with this course in covering all aspects of each module. Moreover, he exceeds expectations by explaining corrected subjects and events, that ultimately ensures a better understanding of the whole phenomenon for each module.Great course!"
9752,Amazingly simple reasons and ways in which we can keep children's food nutrition and healthy!
9753,"Wonderful course, Really enjoy the teaching philosophy and structure to the lessons. Thank you and great job!"
9754,Excellent presentation of material!
9755,"Really helpful, worth to this course."
9756,I really enjoyed learning from Or Nina Cavaco.
9757,"His was a fantastic course! The content was very interesting, especially the section on time-travel, which I absolutely loved. I also liked that the course was perfectly manageable, unlike all the other MOOC's that I have attempted, where the time commitment turns out to be much bigger than expected."
9758,Highly information and inspiring especially to those who work directly in the city Planning Department.
9759,Great starting point for of enthusiast !
9760,"That can I say? In extremely complete course, very resourceful, dynamic and with great quality content from reliable sources. Of you are interested in genetic, you will love this take on epigenetics; definitely worth it."
9761,Learning material is too good and very well organised too. overall i have good learning experience here.Thanks Coursera
9762,A good course for getting start of machine learning .Thanks for your help.
9763,I found this course amazing! It was just what I needed to update my knowledge on the subject. The video and the reading were really information. Congratulations on a terrific course!
9764,Awesome start! Moved the programming assignment!
9765,"It was great, though I think the video classes could have some application examples in the classroom and the material could be available to the students."
9766,"Easy to follow and understand, good balance of conceptual lectures and hands on practices."
9767,"Thank you very much for the course - it was really interesting and I've found some useful technique to be used in my work. However, there are some moments to be improved to make course better: correct questions statements and lack of communication between partisans (there were a lot of interesting topics to discuss but only very few users were involved in discussions, thus, discussion were very poor).But still thank you very much again!!!:))"
9768,Superficial and not well presented.
9769,Great course!
9770,great to start with basis!
9771,I'm ALREADY optimistic about my confidence and capabilities. I write down crazy ideas all of the time. His will not give me a framework for which I can have tons of fun and maybe get a show out there!
9772,Excellent Course. Thanks to Charles :)
9773,"Extremely insightful, even if you are not going to school."
9774,"One of the interesting course i have ever learned , helped me out to learn clot of basis for data science. thank you course."
9775,Really easy and fun to learn Python with this nice and helpful course!
9776,I loved this class but the only reason I have to give it four stars is the over amount of peer review assignment that are extensive. Otherwise it's great but be prepared to work :)
9777,Very Good Course and the Professors explained the material very well. Thanks
9778,Great introduction to differential statistics. Its helped me understand the course well. The lectures were great and the assignment wonderful. Thanks a lot
9779,good lessons but i can manage time to listen . but now i decided to be puncture.
9780,Very information and useful course.
9781,It is really helpful the explanation is more than great I think it is going to be beneficial for all electric related departments.
9782,course is very good. Exercises are very good. learnt clot about the mongodb and spark sal and RDD's
9783,Great course really explain in a real way how can i save a lot of time for important projects. Thanks.
9784,Or. Chuck is the Comb!!!
9785,Really helpful
9786,Excellent course! Interesting and simple to understand.
9787,Such a great course! I've used BeautifulSoup an JSON a lot while scraping the web and this was a nice foundation refreshed. It also taught me coming conventions and I didn't realize I needed! Like properly encoding URL parameter to APIs
9788,Very solid and useful course! I have learned the coming skill and never imagined several lines in R can be so powerful.
9789,It was a very interesting course! I've learned a lot and now I feel more comfortable to understand any other programming language!
9790,The subjects are not learnt deeply and precisely. Too summarized and vague!
9791,"I really like this course, it's simple explained and direct to the point."
9792,"His course is a great way to get started in Organ . It has enough depth as to be interesting and practical, yet not overwhelming to someone who is beginning. I have taken a beginning Organ course in a classroom with a native-speaking instructor but, as I would have expected from Onset, this course is a much better fit."
9793,"Ending today this MOOC can only say that I am very happy for this opportunity , I feel more confident and comfortable to exercise leadership aware in my line of work that is organizational and feel that I have now more tools to add value to my community and the world. Thank you!"
9794,It's one of the best course about machine learning I have ever seen. Thanks Andrew!
9795,Teacher is very enthusiastic and good at providing intuitions for theories.
9796,Excellent Course! I am really learning a lot so far! The programming assignment are also very practical and fun to go through!
9797,"The course consider wide area of themes of Software Security, but not deep. Generally, It's really good course."
9798,It's amazing how little things that we overlook can make a big difference. A team contract is one of such things. Amazing!!!
9799,"Unfortunately, didn`t enjoy this course at all. I have gone through 7 courses on Coursera and finished them with the biggest pleasure and great results. His time I had to leave the course before finishing because:st: content is organized awfully (for example ""HTML overview"" - I knew all the material so I have an idea how it should look like, but lecturer started from the middle of all concepts, than moved to the beginning and together it looked like an unlicked content. I have simply lost a logic inside this.and: Very difficult to get an idea: lecturer doesn`t try to simplify the content, even opposite - I had a feeling, that he makes easy things complicated for a reason. By husband is a programme with 10 years experience and when he watched the lecture he said, that even for him it was difficult to understand all the thing (things he actually knows). All these terms used, no relevant examples, too complex words and so on - I lost concentration, I had to goose a lot of unknown terms, I had to stop lecture every 30 seconds to reread or repeat the peace of lecture, because I could not understand it. Is I mentioned, I know HTML well, but it was described so complex, that it was difficult to link my actual knowledge to lecturer words.rd: not international student friendly. Use of complex words in places where they were not necessary, complex structures, too fast language... I am pretty good in English, but had to stop video and to goose translate some ""smart"" words lecturer used without particular need - I don`t mean definitions, just some epithets to make his speech ""smarter"". I completed Coursera specialization by Michigan University and it was completely easy with plain text, short sentences, so well made for international student.th: this is boring. I am sorry, but this is true. I am interested in all these questions, but for some reasons I lose my attention every time. Maybe the reason is in all points I have just mentioned, but I didn`t enjoy this course at all and it was the first time I didn`t enjoy something connected with web pp development. Please, don`t be mad at me - lecturer is a very charming and charismatic person, but I simply don`t like how the material is presented.th: I have a feeling like all sides are taken from some scientific books and lecturer reads comments from some science articles, it is not like described with own words, simplifies for better comprehension, cleared with own real-life examples and in atmosphere of friendly conversation with some emotions and humor.Please, take my feedback just as my personal opinion and hope other students will enjoy it more."
9800,His course starts quite well but it´s awful at finish
9801,"It's a very well designed course. It speaks about individual choice and how to manage them, market option for green economy, and political acts to achieve it."
9802,Great course even if you´re not new to photography it stores and refreshed and widen your knowledge. And very clear for beginners.
9803,"His course lends scientific support to Buddha's views about human mind, self, meditation, and build a helpful connection between Buddhist and evolutionary psychology. It expands my knowledge of both Buddhist and psychology. Thanks to Or Right's efforts in preparing and sharing this course around the world and his great insight and teaching."
9804,"Excellent! I'm learning a lot from this course. That I like most about it is that this course is newly open so it contains a lot of information about the current economy, especially the examples. I will definitely spend time to finish all the way to the Specialization."
9805,"His is a very helpful course, i have learned a lot! Any thanks :D"
9806,very clear and easy to understand
9807,I guess all advice are useful for me.
9808,Great course！
9809,Excellent! Thank you!
9810,Excellent guidance for new or seasoned teachers.
9811,very good course
9812,"In amazing course that gets you started with what inside a computer, and how it works."
9813,"i love ""teach english now"". It's interesting and effective. Teachers are very carefully to do this courses.Thank you so much"
9814,Excellent introduction to of topics.
9815,Amazing Course to get a hang of how modern web pages are made
9816,"thank u very much had fun in this course, also (hard times in assignment)than again"
9817,really good lecture ! support it !
9818,fantastic from start to finish
9819,His course helps me understand better about the Chinese characters than just reading books.
9820,"Simple, well taught, I learned a lot"
9821,"Good introductory type course but when there are issues a student is having that no other peer can resolve, the instructor are almost NEVER available to assist."
9822,this is an amazing course and there is a lot to learn. the course director took his time to explain things for even a layman to understand. Perfect course with perfect lectures. I loved every aspect of it.
9823,His course is very helpful
9824,Very good course.
9825,"Such better than the previous version (2015) with all concepts very well explained, using examples to clarify them when necessary.I would have liked to go deeper with Hadoop (in last version of the specialization, Hadoop was a separate course), but anyway, as an Introduction to Fig Data, this is an excellent course."
9826,"Awesome course, great learning opportunity."
9827,Great course.
9828,course content was very good.It is a very good platform to learn about materials.
9829,Thanks to the Course team for the efforts
9830,"Well worth the time. I use this information every day, and it reminds me to be my better self."
9831,"good, but no material and lack of structure"
9832,Some of the most advanced learning taught in amazing simplicity and choice of real world examples to make earners understand the fundamentals. The quires were awesome and same were the assignment.
9833,Really enjoyed this course. Lots of good information on how to identify face news.
9834,"Creative! I learnt a lot of anecdotes, and situations. Thank You!"
9835,Excellent. Fantastic tutor who delivers the program effectively.
9836,Excellent. Take this course if u anna improve your fundamentals on mechanics of materials
9837,His course was a great introduction to Machine Learning and definitely well worth the time and effort spent. Andrew G is a great teacher and I really enjoyed the class.
9838,"His course effectively covers important concepts and algorithms of Machine Learning. Linear Depression, Logistic Depression, Neutral Network, K-means fluttering are most impressive parts of the course.Most of the algorithms don't involve complicated formula and can be easily understood. To I had always been motivate. The programming exercises are well designed so that I could strengthen my understanding by completing them. Professor G provides a lot of suggestions on developing a Machine Learning system based on his experience, which I think people can hardly learn from textbook."
9839,"a great course, I know a lot of new stuff"
9840,Moved this course. Great teacher!
9841,"Really great course! I'm really enjoying it, thank's a lot Or. Chuck!!!!"
9842,Great course!!!! It was an excellent introduction on how to correctly use our brain resources in order to learn more effectively.
9843,Very fun and thorough. Deep it up!
9844,"Most of the effort in the creation of this course seems to have gone into the visual and caustic effects of the sides. The first week's material has no substance whatsoever (literally!). The second week' s presentations are just listing of lengthy definitions and ""West practices"" which in fact are mostly goals, not practices.With the poor quality of the provided video, my hope was that the reading would be better. But the second week's reading are commented links to a 270 page NIST document, an Open Online Course(!!!) and OWASP material.It this point it is clear that continuing the course is not going to help me in the way I would expect it from a course. When I compare this to the excellent Software Security course of Michael Licks (University of Maryland) , which I also attend on Coursera, there are worlds between both.I understand that ""Cybersecurity and its Men Remains"" addresses students with less prior knowledge, but especially for such students I would expect a much better didactic approach.One star seems harsh, but after the first two weeks, the only words I find for this are: ""seriously?"""
9845,Thanks Charlie. :-)
9846,That is Western Philosophy? Were's an answer that also helps you understand the ways people behave.
9847,To not recommend. Chaotic and full of irrelevant (IMO) information. Does it really matter in which year some paper was written? Or from which latin word the term 'interest rate' derives?
9848,"While I enjoyed this course and the topics covered, I don't feel like the course content matched what the course description stated it was supposed to. I enrolled in the Business Analytics Specialization course with a focus on analyzing a business from the inside, not outside. Of the 4 weeks of the course, I'd say that only week 4 was valid from an internal perspective but it was kept very high level. I'd say this course could be good for a specialization in business market analysis, but not as advertised.I also found the cartoon classroom questions to be very annoying, almost as bad as fingernails on a blackguard."
9849,"Excellent course. I started it being a bit skeptically, just with the intention to go quickly through some video script. but I changed my mind. There is so much to learn here"
9850,"a lookout of reading. it's a very deep class, if you have time and desire to read all stuff. Prof. Shapiro is extremely knowledgeable, however, sometimes he is too polite (and boring as well) =). On't try to watch it at night. Last several weeks require a lot of focused attention. Finally, my grade is 8.5 out of 10."
9851,Some very interesting insight and good analogies
9852,Great course and foundation skill! Enjoyed the lectures!
9853,"Great teacher, fascinating ideas. The reading was pretty intense, but I loved that about it."
9854,Of you spend some time through practicing basis later you can master much more complicated topics.Blind and drunk Hung ff master ... :)
9855,Great course! Very information and all the concepts are very clearly explained!
9856,amazing course
9857,"(+) Manageable bite-sized online lectures with interesting content that are highly relevant to the topic of Learning Now to Learn(+) Assessment are pitched at the right level, with questions requiring recall of the concepts learnt and some other comprehension- and application-type questions that require a bit more thinking to apply the concepts learnt.(+) Professor Valley has a very interesting style of presenting the topic that makes the material very easy to digest and learn. The communicates key learning points in a concise and succinct manner using a variation of simple analogies, way (but meaningful) graphics, life stories and other examples to draw out or to associate to important lesson takeaways.(+) Personally, I did not managed to finish all the optional interviews but I really appreciate the time and effort used to clean additional input and insight from multiple perspective and I hope to be able to visit this course at a later time.(+) Professor Sejnowski's insight into learning how our brain works is something new to me. It is also an important part of this course. Although I could barely recall the terminologies, but certain images that he has shared to assist in scientific explanations, and the true accounts of of as well as the two scientists who swallowed poison without being poisoned, did stay in me and helped me understand the material better.Thank you, Professor Valley and Sejnowski, the course was meaningful and well-paced, offering insight into learning and how the brain works. I greatly appreciate the effort and time spent to make the materials and information illustration for earners."
9858,"Very simple, however very useful and practical. I really appreciated the assignment."
9859,Great course! I like it :) and it punch me in git :D :)
9860,"Very good course and very useful. I'm satisfied, is a worth it investment of time."
9861,I have learned a lot from this co
9862,His course was helpful. I learnt a lot on grammar and punctuation.
9863,"His course gave an overview of hiring and developing talent, but had far fewer actionable takeaways than the first course in the specialization. I found Her Alexander's sections to be extremely long-minded, unclear, and redundant. Also, I like the idea of mixing up the assignment format, but creating three moves is a lot to ask for a management course, especially when the same assignment could easily have been done in another format - it felt forced. Also, I found that the order for some lectures seemed off and the flow between instructor was not as fearless as it had been before. For instance, we were asked to create a development plan at the end of a week about hiring and before the week on development."
9864,I thoroughly enjoyed the course which gave me the insight of project management.Thanks a lot to Mob Tone Air!
9865,"The best ever course, Or Charles is at his best and I would recommend this course to everyone who wants to start learning Python. I have gained confidence over Python.Thank you sir for a clear explanation of all the things, and I would definitely go through the video multiple times in case I have any questions."
9866,Interesting course but would have liked some additional video discussions from practitioner in the field.
9867,"Quick and precise....touched on some crucial aspects , especially team building and working with difficult people ! Thank you !"
9868,"His course is simple enough to understand the complexity that is game development but that is not to say it doesn't pack a challenge. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for offering this amazing course up to the public. Which I wouldn't of had access to without wonderful and awesome people like those at Michigan State and Coursera. Thank you so much."
9869,Interesting course and interesting people to share thoughts with. Highly recommended!
9870,It's totally awesome! I've learned a bunch (this course in particular helped me to study better and understand what's going on 'behind the scenes' of my thought process). Love it!
9871,Vice course with content focused on the extra things C++ brings - STL. However it would have been better if Inheritance also covered in this course. Also learned about Wraps through this course. Exercises were tough but were good.
9872,"it provides me a lot new point of view knowledge , and it broad my eyes of view, and i appreciate the astonishing new ideas and concepts."
9873,Great and fun activities with solid academic foundations
9874,"most contents are explicit on put, it is sometimes not necessary to view the lectures."
9875,"Thanks to the well-organized, information, and helpful course!"
9876,Thank you professor for this nice course.
9877,Really challenge and useful.Thanks very much.
9878,"i would request you to start a similar course on Prosthodontics- Fixed, Removable & Plant prosthodontics. I enjoyed the course. It was a great experience."
9879,Great introduction for a broad theme!
9880,Such a nicely science-based course on how to get the most out of life - thank you!
9881,"Perfect Course,Thank you!"
9882,Great course! Moving the experience of programming!
9883,I really love the course but I dont understand whether this part of the course is free or is not.
9884,"It is a wonderful course for serious earners wanting to learn about the human nervous system and how it works. I myself am a medical doctor (I graduated over two years ago) and I can fattest that (in my university at least) I didn't have neuroscience lectures with this depth and detail.Due to my medical background I found it comfortable to go through the course without much effort or lots of extra studying. But I figure that if you do not have some such foundation it might be a bit more challenging to go smoothly with the course, and you might needs more extra studying and more time put into the course.But if you are interested about neuroscience and want to learn the essentials of how the human brain works (as per our current knowledge) then I recommend that you put in the effort and go with the course even if you don't have a strong background in the life sciences or in medicine.Any thanks to Or White and everybody else who have participated in creating and maintaining this course."
9885,"The best course on Coursera, I've ever taken and intend to complete! Thank you!"
9886,Superb. Feel I have learn't so much. Thank you to all involved.
9887,The lectures are clear and the practical assignment are very nice!
9888,Fundamental concepts are explained very well. Explaining concepts through solving problem made it easy to grasp the concept. Contents are short and precise. I loved it.
9889,Very useful for me as an Engineer but a bit out of date
9890,good course！~
9891,Very nice lecture video and explanations! Totally worth it
9892,Fool
9893,"Or. Chuck and his crew really make this enjoyable. It's challenging enough to keep you working & thinking, but when you need help you can get it very quickly. I'm really enjoying the class."
9894,His course is a fantastic tool to understand the principles that bind the American society since the beginning of its existence. I feel very honored to complete this marvelous MOOC. Thank you all for the opportunity.
9895,I really liked to do it
9896,The deep insight about the problems and innovative solutions to them which Prof. Each talked about are commendable. The course equipped me with all the basic knowledge which I can use in my further studies.
9897,"I have appreciated the course as it explains the main concepts of Fig Data drilling through until several tools which can be used to implement important operations for Fig Data analysis, for example, how does a search engine basically works. It has very interesting topics and will help me up in my daily job routine."
9898,Great work. Superb Reaching !
9899,"His is a very inspiring course to study, thank you Or. Valley and Or. Sejnowski!"
9900,"In awesome course! I learned a lot of HTML, CSS and of."
9901,Fantastic Free Course. A must seen for programme.
9902,Really very well designed course for professional working in the field of Infrastructure development.
9903,Good overview on data science. Assisted in better conceptualizing how as a manager to evaluate and implement data science and analysis concepts to decision making.
9904,The course gives a whole perspective of the venom of AIDS and its impact
9905,Its a great course.Please add a module about how to find the significant variable after using all these technologies.
9906,All the material was relevant to algorithms and the advance problem were very challenging must To course for those who are interested in algorithms designthank you course and its team
9907,Thanks for designing this wonderful you
9908,"Take some good points, but still difficult to achieve"
9909,Challenging and difficult thus rewarding experience . I think the great thing about this course is the freedom they give to make certain programs with whatever way you want to use.
9910,A good course with adequate practice on spider IDE.
9911,"Clearly explained concepts of Python data structures. Interesting bonus materials and very ""cool"" teacher (also he has tattoo :-D )"
9912,Very recommended for those looking to strengthen skill and knowledge. Good for those that want to be up to date to marketing tends.
9913,All the lecture were thorough and good.
9914,"Great course! Finished it in 2 days. Lots of trial and error. Really enjoy Or. Chuck's humor and excellent explanations. Also, thank you very much for providing the option to take this course free of charge. Looking forward to the next course in the series, thanks again!"
9915,"Very good,thanks to the teacher."
9916,"Really really enjoyed this course. Interesting and thought provoking material, all very well presented and reference. The inclusion of various guest speakers, video and film clips, and a good dose of humour (only occasionally flat) all helped make this a very enjoyable 6 weeks.Of you have a curiosity about happiness, especially your own, but a midst that values the evidence over other's opinions, then I strongly recommend this course."
9917,His is more enlightening than the previous courses in the specialization. It felt like learning new material and technique rather than simply reviewing concepts I already knew. I also liked that the assignment required creating actual artifacts and reviewing others' work. The industry interviews were a nice addition as well.
9918,Great way to teach I am enjoying it
9919,"Great course, beyond all expectations! Gives very structures into on social behavior patterns and outcome from that behavior. Highly recommended."
9920,"very useful. it connected me to the reality of digital marketing. I thought it would be boring, but it's definitely not the case."
9921,It is a facet that any organization needs work on. It helps with overall engagement and retention of employees.
9922,Full of the diverse sub topics about sustainable development the course is pretty good in motivation you to consider this astounding subject that sadly requires a let's say continuation to allow you to make every thing that is discussed part of your life.
9923,"His course is very helpful for people looking for a way to learn more efficiently. That being said, I feel that many students might not grasp that fact because they feel that they know already much of what is said. I honestly don't know how you could improve that without putting some thought into it. I hope this helpsand thank you."
9924,Very good lessons. Low and progressive
9925,I'd recommend to anyone.
9926,"Very good course with many useful tips, insight, great respondent, technique, and it walnut professors` hearts into this work."

9928,"Great course, I learned the basic of psychology at work and give a good insight of what to correctly do to motivate, have less issues with stress and so on. :)"
9929,"Great course, great professor."
9930,"Great course! Definitely a must-visit for anyone interested in graphics design. Even though I am myself a practicing graphics designer for about five years now, I did learn quite a lot of interesting and, most important, useful information there. Highly recommend it."
9931,The course is brilliant.
9932,"Good introduction to an area where library science, information science and archivistics come together."
9933,"The professor are incredibly good, nice and enthusiastic. The subject of the course should be taught in all schools. A very good course."
9934,"With Theropod Dinosaurs and the Origin of Birds MOOC I finally completed all Also Online Courses offered by University of Albert. I enjoyed all Also MOOCs given their very interesting content and outstanding presentation, but I must say that Early Vertebrae Evolution was far the best one, in my opinion. It is also true to say that all University of Albert MOOCs, as usual, provided first class lecture notes. I would like to thank all the personnel involved in developing and making available this amazing tool for propagation science and knowledge. And I would like to suggest standardizing the measuring unit system throughout all courses, because there is an interchangeable use of either imperial or merit, and since most of the world uses merit system, that could be a good way to go."
9935,"I am not in financial major, but the with the help the this course, they teach the basic conceptions and ideas about corporation finance.I appreciate a lot."
9936,Very information and easy to understand
9937,"The course was really good. I've studied Chinese in China for three years and I still learned so much from this course. I also got a lot of new vocabulary. Things to improve: the conversations need to be louder, the teacher is sometimes standing in front of the words so they're hard to see, the grammar could use a little more explanation. Overall, it's a good course. Thanks to everyone who worked hard to make it happen!谢谢你们。"
9938,It's a really good course.. and there is a lot of useful information to put in practice in everyday activities.
9939,Exciting and Challenging approach
9940,His course is extremely helpful and thoughtfully designed keeping in mind about users who are new to programming.

9942,Really good introductory course for power electronics!!
9943,cool
9944,really basic into
9945,"His course is the very basis of interface building in in, requires lots of self-study as the lectures do not dig deep enough and prior knowledge of Swift."
9946,I really liked this course. I am glad I chose this as my first online course.
9947,"In excellent course, with well-presented study material, good supplementary resources, enjoyable and moderately sophisticated assignment (these usually took me more than the claimed 3 hours to accomplish, yet everything is solvable with a bit of thinking and attention). Recommended for anyone interested in conceptual foundations and basic topics of machine learning (elementary path and programming skill would be desirable).Thank a lot."
9948,In excellent course that mixed essay writing with quires to test the individual's knowledge of the course content.
9949,Great Course!Built a Instagram Not and WhatsApp not for personal user after completing this courseAwesomeThanks a lot Or. Chuck

9956,More real world examples of Golden Ratio necessary
9957,Great Course :)
9958,Practical and inspiring for positive changes in one owns life.
9959,"Certainly not a beginners course. You needed to have a good programming knowledge to make any sense of this course. The final assignment asked you to do things you hadn't been taught. Is I hadn't done any programming for 20 years, I certainly found this difficult. Well behind and there isn't really anyone there to help. Almost asked for a refund but decided to try to continue. I'm struggling to motivate myself into the second course. I really hope it's better than the first one."
9960,Course was excellent. Learnt a lot.Had a good experience.
9961,Needs to pay for submit assignment
9962,"Awesome, one of the best things I ever learnt"
9963,very interesting course for beginners and wannabe pp developer
9964,His course is a joke. Contents is very very poor. And you will have a lot of problems making the Assigments.
9965,"Great introductory course, highly recommended as a first time or for a brush up !"
9966,Perfect teaching. Thank you
9967,"A highly scientific and engaging course. I have learned many useful, practical tips and will be referring back to many of the video at a later date to keep myself on track to happiness :-)"
9968,"Excellent course, practical, visual understanding of the concepts and beautifully illustrated of all concepts, definitions and examples. A course that you most take to understand differential statistics with R as a compliment.Congratulations to the whole staff that design, produce and teach this course, fantastic !!!!"
9969,very good course for all managers
9970,good experience
9971,Not for new programme. The lecture material is also not logical organized and does not correspond to the assignment.
9972,this course is very good for those who anna go beyond sky..
9973,"Love love love this course!!!Jonathan Miss is very well-acquainted with Beethoven's sonata. His explanations are beautiful and I love how thorough he is! He goes through the fine, minute details of Beethoven's sonata without sacrificing the loomed-out view of Beethoven's life and influences as well.Besides that, Miss is an extraordinary pianist and clearly loves and admires Beethoven's sonata. I hope he'll keep on adding to this course!"
9974,Very good introduction
9975,His course is a very good introductory of bayesian statistics. But it better that you have known the basic statistics inference.
9976,It was a great course with full of insight.
9977,Exceptional Tutorial... His is really a nice tutoring. Well presented and explained. Practical activity is too good. Thanks
9978,very simple . assignment are ok. I would prefer it if the assignment would be all applications and programming.
9979,Mrs. Valley and Sejnowsky are magnificent instructor and have provided an invaluable service to earners all over the world. Thank
9980,"I really enjoyed the course through the 12 weeks, but I think the sides could have some diagram/drawings to show the concepts when ""Or T"" Chamillard is giving the lecture. His way, understand the concepts would be a lot easier, specially for the people who is starting in the development world"
9981,Great
9982,Easy to learn Chinese. It is very clear instruction.
9983,Lectures are in Hebrew. English subtitles are in Hebrew also. Completely useless unless you understand Hebrew. I am about to drop this class.
9984,"His is the course that started Coursera. Andrew G is the man!Of I had one criticism, it would be that the matas assignment are a little bit too ""done for you"" already. Ideally, we would implement everything ourselves using the tool of our choice, but I understand that that'd be impossible in the context of this course."
9985,Very good beginner course. Good pace. Looking forward to the next course.
9986,Thank you for your teaching!
9987,"His was a really practical, useful course! All information was presented simply and concisely. Such appreciation and thanks to Or. Barbara Valley and Or. Terence Sejnowski."
9988,A very good course for beginners!
9989,thank you.
9990,"The course material is mostly good if a bit basic at times. Of the notes went a little more in depth, or the suggested resources were a little less bulky, it would be 5 stars."
9991,"very good introduction course for beginners, and it was funny and inspiring to watch those bonus video, thanks a lot."
9992,Very good course. Not a lot of useful insight. - Quizzes are fine and just right amount. But needs more challenging lab exercises for practice.
9993,"Great course, so much fun!!"
9994,Truly Creative!
9995,"I am glad to learn this class, because the teacher is nice and talk the planting method easily."
9996,Very nicely explained. By old MBA concepts are erased and new wisdom attained. Thank you very much...
9997,Very well structures and presented the main data struck in Python
9998,"Very good course, it has a decent mix of theory and practice to dive into the board's specific."
9999,Strong into to R
10000,"Wonderful instructor, truly engaging course! Learning Now to Learn has given me a new confidence in pursuing and mastering quantitative subjects necessary for me to secure the career in healthcare that I have always dreamed about, but was never sure about. I've already seen amazing results with my current science courses and will be sure to use and share the technique highlight in the course throughout the rest of my life. Thank you!"
10001,Really nice course to get you start with the Data science in Python
10002,"The course tighten back everything that was taught in the 3 previous courses. It helps me recall important information and reinforce my understanding of developing good lesson plans not only for daily but also weekly classes. The teachers, both instructor and teachers for observation sessions are fun, lively, and very helpful in conveying many useful take-away for my own class development.Thank you so much Or. Have and Is. Jessica for producing such a high quality and helpful course!"
10003,"Great Course, well structures and following a clear path. Would enjoy some more of the optional technical background!"
10004,It was awesome. I loved!
10005,"Must following a text book, without an added value from the lectures."
10006,Must about okay. Wouldn't recommend to pay for this.
10007,"Exceptional, a course that everyone should take, congratulations on the team who put it together and gave their time so people like myself could benefit from their knowledge."
10008,Very well organized course. Well done .
10009,"One of the most awesome courses in Machine Learning, with awesome senators."
10010,"More than a simple introduction to iss. Great content, great delivery."
10011,Excellent - well structures and great practical examples
10012,Fantastic course. Very useful
10013,it was interesting to learn about the dynamic of the Internet and how it is used for villains purposes.
10014,Met to complete the course but got inspired by into lecture of Prof Omaha ! Awesome.
10015,"Thanks you, It was great and useful MOOC,"
10016,Wonderful and a must enjoy for all those who are writing their first resumes.
10017,"The course covers a great deal of content, which is very relevant to day to day business context.However, the course instructor can certainly do a better job on providing clear instructions on Projects and pleasing of Ruin questions. Some of the pleasing of questions/deliverables can be confusing and often requires vigorous deciphering."
10018,I'm in the middle of the course but having taken many MOOCs I am already far more engaged in the lectures and discussion. I think the model of having the two students to query works well to make us stop and think about how we might answer the question and to reflect on the logic. I also like the black and white nourish atmosphere of the filling although not quite sure why its like that. I also like the fact that there is reading and not just lecture.
10019,His is a great class where I learnt really exciting things! I am now looking forward to apply all that on the subject I am working on!
10020,Great course!
10021,A fantastic overview of the subject. Highly recommended!
10022,I especially thank you for those great 9 blocks. They are really helpful to start.
10023,Excellent!!!! material.....i really enjoy and learn this course
10024,Worthwhile. Very Worthwhile.
10025,"the way Professor Andrew taught is very practical and he not only introduces the algorithm itself but also gives a lot of suggestions on how to use it properly.I know i need to review these when i really confront it, so i am really appreciated for all of this!"
10026,"The contrast of provided material is quite huge. In first for weeks all the analysis are explained and decisions are shown, in the last week only principles and overall concepts are introduced."
10027,Absolutely impressive! Learning a lot
10028,"Great course, I like the practical approach!"
10029,"Great subjects and some great teachers. But every now and then I missed some proper explanations.Further, references to articles and books to better understand the subjects were missing as well."
10030,"Very useful, easy and clear understanding. Thanks for your lecture and many peers."
10031,"Amazing course, I fully recommend it to anyone who want to improve his/her educational technique.Greetings and thanks ASU/Coursera"
10032,Love this course! Thank you a lot!
10033,"I am studying this course, all the points are being made crystal-clear as is expected from such a great prof li"
10034,"Very useful course and great lectures, i really enjoyed the time.. thank you very much"
10035,i didn't really enjoy this course
10036,"Great course, I loved the examples and video of practices throughout the learning!"
10037,Amazing! Very productive!
10038,That was a great experience to join this course. I work in the luxury retail and it helps me to have a clear vision of the current and future challenges in this business. I would like to go deeper in each subjects in applying later to a luxury and fashion management MBA.
10039,"Excellent presentation, solid lesson plan, and one of the most educational approaches to strategy. Professor Rosenberg illustrated comprehensible presentations and lesson that kept me engaged. Highly recommend for those learning about Sustainability."
10040,Very good overview of the core principles of data science
10041,"Enjoyed week 1, looking forward to week 2. Believe my review will be five stars by the end of the course. Am interested in taking more MOOC like this in philosophy.Enjoyed week 2, looking forward to week 3 and starting Ancient Philosophy: Aristotle and His Successors. I like the lecture style and can tell Susan really enjoys teaching the subject.Enjoyed week 3, looking forward to week 4. To far, Plato and Socrates make much more sense to me than Aristotle but I have only done week 1 of Ri. Perhaps Ri fellows a bit as he gets older, lets hope so. ~(B-)Must finished week 4, great course. Only sorry that I could't give it six stars. I read that Socrates was married to a bit of a dragon who kicked him out of the house every day, either to get a 'real' job or so he wouldn't get under her feet while she was doing the homework. To, Philosophy could have started as an alternative to drink or hanging 'round the bodies all day? Mind you, the drink still got to him in the end. To wonder his decision to go for the Wedlock was taken so quickly. Wonder why Socrates didn't ask other Athenian why they got married? Of he had all other philosophers since may have been singles with no advice for the rest of humanity on the 'what, why, when, who, where, when, and how' of the logic of the process. Perhaps Aristotle may have the answer? See you all on the next stage down the road to discovering the 'Meaning of Life'. T.T.F.N."
10042,Good introduction to Scratch and computing.
10043,His is a very fabulous and intelligent course about photography among the years.The Plus is the inside view of the artists! The a lot MOMA- i am An!
10044,"Good Course, nice examples."
10045,perfect course for applying machine learning algorithms into my daily work. I love the programming assignment so much
10046,"I'm in the data science specialization. Statistical Inference was my th course. All of them have been on a spectrum of good to great. But Statistical Inference is a mixed bag for me.First, if you are thinking about this course, take some time reading the other reviews. I find many of them resolute with my experience leading to 1/5 stars.One reviewed who gave 5/5 stars said they loved the course. They suggested that other reviews who gave low rating are ones that dropped out. I don't find this to be the case. Any of the low rating reviews actually did pass the course and said very similar things as those who did not pass the course.Another reviewed enjoyed Brian's dry humour. I must have missed the jokes after watching each video 5 times...For the record, I almost acid this course. The reason for not getting 100% was because I was so annoyed with one of the quires that I didn't bother taking it again to correct it. I decided living with 8/10 correct questions was better than having a stroke while in the pursuit of two extra points. Yes, that is how much I hated this course.The first 2 weeks of the course were the worst. I dropped out for about a month (because of life priorities). When I couldn't get motivate. 1 month turned into 2 months, then into 3 months. I basically took the entire summer off. Finally I bit the bullet and completed the final 2 weeks. The rd week of the course wasn't actually all that bad (though the quit was terrible). The th week felt like the first 2 weeks...terrible.(By the way, it's a mistake to take such a long break. I had to re-watch the first video to recall things for the remaining quires).Of you don't have some sort of statistical knowledge (or inherent aptitude), be prepared to work four times longer on the course. For all your quit and assignment time-to-completion estimates, multiply them by 4 or more. Seriously, I spent probably 10 hours on the final assignment which said it should only take 2 hours. Each quit took me an entire Sunday afternoon (By partner was not pleased).Now here is where things get awkward. I hated the course .... BUT....I learned things that actually stuck. To in THAT regard, I give this course extra stars. It accomplished something that some University courses could not. I even found myself USING the new knowledge in real world problems. To ironically, is that not a sign that it's ...dare I say...a GOOD course?Would I take the course again? I actually might, but ONLY because of its place in the overall mortification. Of you are a prospective student wondering if you should take the course as a standalone course, I don't think I could recommend it, because there are far better ways to learn. In fact, just doing the Will lessons could be good enough.Of you are a prospective student and you want the mortification, then you'll HAVE to take the course. Why are you even bothering to read reviews?To I'm giving the course 3/5 stars. Of I gave it 1 or 2 stars, my review would be clustered with the majority. Of I gave it 4 or 5 stars, I'd be lying."
10047,"Creative Writing: The Draft of Clot is simply one of the best video courses I have found on the subject. Easy to follow, great examples, clearly explained, engaging presentations and assignment, tips from the experts; all those things made this one course I couldn't ""put down"". Grand Skyhorse comes across as a phenomena teacher who really knows his subject and truly cares about it, that alone makes the course worth watching. I will definitely be referring back to this again. Deep an eye on the education should my novel ever hit the shelves!"
10048,Precise teaching. Informative.
10049,Amazing course! It can inspire every professional who is interested in trauma- informed approach or who is working with populations experiencing trauma.
10050,"I feel that this course is not looked after. Teachers are not actively present. There was an error on one quit and another assignment was very poorly explained, leading to many feeling like we lost marks due to not knowing exactly what was expected of us. Any of the lessons waste time gushing over what's coming next, but quite often the lesson itself feels weak and vague. It some points I struggled to understand the point the lessons were trying to make. I learned a few interesting things, but for the most part I'm extremely disappointed with this course."
10051,"The video lectures are information and interesting, but the QUIZZES COVER INFORMATION NOT ADDRESSED of THE LECTURES!!"
10052,Great! Or. Chuck is wonderful presented!
10053,"His is an excellent course to review basic dentist, wish you all best"
10054,"Awesome Course. One of the best courses ,i have been part of on course.well paced, very rich in content, very good delivery of the ideas,.Assignment very good. A value for time just wish practice quit to have more number of question, and more challenging.A VERY SPECIAL THANKS of JOGESH. THANKS A LOT"
10055,The course was well organized. examples and assignment helped my understanding. I was able to learn what I needed for much less time than I expected!
10056,"Excellent course, I highly recommend this course!"
10057,A nice and very interesting introduction to the field of Social marketing.
10058,"Additionally to the very interesting and useful content proposed in this course, I have found it very much enjoyable and pleasant thanks to the talent of Or. Chuck. Thanks a lot Or. Chuck you are really a wonderful person and I hope to meet you in person one day."
10059,Easily comprehensible course for introduction to Python Programming
10060,"Interesting, information"
10061,"In my opinion, this course is so simple but yet an effective learning tool for those individuals who are a beginners in the field of terrorist and counterterrorism studies. Even though, if it is not your field of study, this course gives you a beginners look on how things actually role in this field and gives you a sense of satisfaction along with deep and clear understanding of this body of knowledge than what the mainstream media shows. His course have given me and think it will for others, an incentive to do something about these issues mentioned in the course."
10062,His is an excellent course for those who have forgotten the basis of punctuation.
10063,"great teacher, good material and excellent examples.He knows how to teach =)"
10064,Amazing course who helped me improve my learn ability!
10065,"the last chapter was a lit bit challenging, thus, students can learn a lot!"
10066,"His course introduced me to new valuable concepts, that I find useful in my daily work. I liked the clarity of most of the teachers. The case studies served to understand better the concepts presented. However, I would have liked to learn more about the situation regarding water resource management in South America."
10067,I got a better structure to think about money market.
10068,"Excellent experience, Professor Rude, Thanks a lot!"
10069,"In my opinion, it was a good course because it was well structures, understandable and easy to follow. Even tough I found it useful, I would like to find more content on english grammar."
10070,"The course is good enough--a means to an end. The 4-part, six weeks apart format is kind of bothersome because the wait period sort of happens the momentum and enthusiasm created during the first course (especially if you complete the whole thing in a week-end). The course is well put together and refused with a little humor. The visual are good and if you're in the right mood, the course is enjoyable and fun to interact with folks from around the world."
10071,A very good course for those who want to learn from the very basis and know the roots of web designing.
10072,Good Overview Course
10073,Easy to follow and understand
10074,"Initially gets very boring but at the end gives you more information about where to orient yourself, some useful information,"
10075,"It is a poor course because is not properly designed for international. Language is mainly French in sides and subtle is not that helpful.Instead of spending time outside to read the notes, it was better to prepare helpful sides for students to understand better what you are talking about."
10076,Must for a new age programme
10077,Really great theoretical introduction to various Machine Learning algorithms.
10078,this is really useful
10079,Answers are always the first option. I don't like that.
10080,too simple
10081,"The course gives the basis about every thing you have to know about wind energy. There are many instructor participating, showing the effort in giving a good course with experts in each matter"
10082,The pronunciation of the electors is more than awful! Their English is quite unsuitable for video lectures! To I quit the course. It is just a torture listening to them!
10083,"Extremely well articulated!English is not my native language, and the teacher was very good at repeating important words so I was able to understand it fully.I loved the way the teacher reached out to our mind by making us think rather than telling ""predigested"" material. He presented facts and suggestions that fired my interest.His course lets you as a student form your own opinions and your own strategics based on facts and suggestions.The community was also very good at commenting and helped me expand my own ""horizon"""
10084,I just started this course.I have seen the course outline and i can state categorically that it is the real thing.
10085,Content is very basic.
10086,It's very nice that I can learn game theory very easy. He reaches about concept of game theory very well by using many situation.
10087,His course was very information and can easily be used in any business setting. I can go an apply the methods learned in this course to any organization's financial statement to get a better idea of their financial performance. I really enjoyed in week 4 how the information learned in prior weeks can be tied to nonfinancial measures in developing a causal model to improve the performance of a company.
10088,"Very funny and experienced Professor!Very helpful and thorough course, but a little bit too easy.Very good starting point for those want to learn programming but no previous programming experience."
10089,Thank you very much for the course. I really enjoyed it.
10090,Thanks a lot! Very convenient and useful management of the course!
10091,"While the content and the curriculum of the course is ok, the course is not moderate enough in terms of answering the questions the participants have"
10092,The course contents and arrangement of topics are easy to understand.
10093,Very helpful for very begging!
10094,His is a great course which helps me understand the fundamentals of machine learning!
10095,"EXCELLENT COURSE, I would like to further learn more chinese as part of the coming course. Very much interested in getting insight and understanding Chinese."
10096,Or. Chuck continues to be an awesome teacher and makes programming understandable and fun!
10097,"Good course, very well explained and the assignment are funny"
10098,Great course! Thank you :)
10099,"His was an absolutely outstanding course. Professionally delivered, thoroughly researches content and recognized experts, engaging and very interesting. I have learned so much and actually finished the course in a week. I have always been attracted to and loved mountains, but never knew much about them. or their surrounding environment. His course has broadened my understanding greatly and has given me a base to further learn and educate myself. The world map of mountains and important sites was a great tool that I appreciated. I would have liked to see more of the teach tips and perhaps an overview of the technical gear needed to explore the mountains. I wish this course would have been available 25 years ago, it may have changed my career choice! I am left with an even larger appetite to get out, explore, and learn! Thanks so much!"
10100,It's very useful.
10101,great and loads to learn
10102,"Great Course, strongly recommend!"
10103,Love it. Exciting and clear and concise. Bravo....
10104,"Thank you Like, for providing such a Course! When I looked for Courses on corporate sustainability, I found less than expected. Hence, being happy to have found this. I really enjoyed the Course and I strongly recommend it. And for someone who had already dealt with this Topic before the Course, the Content could have been Little more detailed and comprehensive. But since the Course addresses not only People who deal with the Topic on a regular Basis, obviously it is understandable why it is designed like that."
10105,Great course! All information is very good structures and easy to understand. Highly recommended!Good luck to everyone!
10106,That a great refreshed course! The professor really simplifies the content into a format that was easily understood.
10107,His is very good and understandable course. I specially thanks to Professor who explain each thing in very expressive manner and assignment are too good. Thanks for the developer and Coursera which give me this opportunity.
10108,One of the most useful courses for everyone to take!
10109,Really Good work on the Course :) Enjoyed it.. Really Useful.. Deep it up. Hoping for more :) Or Chuck is amazing :)
10110,"simple， clear, and useful!"
10111,By first course ever. Comprehensive and clear.
10112,Very good course to start learning Python collections. Thanks!
10113,"His course provided a great balance, reviewing the main available literature along with presenting super-practical applications, and a good mix of information about policy, science and human behaviour. I've recommended it to my entire team!"
10114,based on impressions after module 1:-quality of lectures: just dry material from books. not engaging- repetition (video in reading materials and in lecture) sometimes feeling that it is waste of time-quite questions are hardly connected to lecturesdisappointed and discouraged. give a try to module 2 and will see.
10115,I really enjoyed this course and will use the information I've learnt with my daughter as well as some of my students. The professors were engaging and taught the concepts in a way that one could understand. I look forward to trying out my new skill in other courses.
10116,"Fluttering topic is covered superficially, too much time spend on employing plot graph, not very useful since making graph is straightforward on other software, like expel, once you aggregate datasets correctly. I had not found it very enriching as a course. I would merge this class within R-Programming section and call it Part 2 rather than categorizing into ""Exploratory Data Analysis""."
10117,"It was a good, brief session that provided basic information on presentations."
10118,"Of you want to learn Python, this series should be your first step!"
10119,"Simply a great course! It really gives you the tools to create intelligent algorithms.Although, I would not recommend it to those with no foundation of calculus, linear algebra or programming. You can attempt to do this course, but the course load will be at least twice as much, because you need to figure out those three things as well. (I myself major in Chemical Engineering and did a minor Programming)"
10120,"Very complete course, with a lot of theory notions and practical exercises.But the material needs to be updated and revised with the erratic"
10121,"I had previous Organ Language knowledge but this course really helped me polish some conversation and vocabulary skill, while also learning new things."
10122,Very clear
10123,"Good course on how one could improve one studying. It emphasized a lot on the 'no pain, no gain' mentality. Any technique are mentioned and are very helpful. Some may find this to be a bit redundant since you may already been doing lots of the things they are talking about in the video. Nevertheless, it is a very interesting course. Would recommend the book by Or.Valley since it is a lot more detailed."
10124,Great started course
10125,"His is my first course on this site and I really enjoyed it. The interesting thing is, some of the things the professors spoke about are things I've done before but it wasn't that effective because I did it wrong. His course simply reaches how to learn effectively but it's up to you to practice what you've been thought. The professors are wonderful and so are the interviews. Either you are having difficulty studying or you want to improve your studies, this course is great!"
10126,"quite easy, good for beginners"
10127,"Excellent, one of the most good teacher that i ever have. Recommended 100%"
10128,"His course is one of the most attractive course for me, I have working for more than 5 years in of area but never seen before any courses like this course. Thanks to Professor. Think"
10129,Finished
10130,His course is ideal if you're looking for a head start into Machine Learning :)
10131,Meaning of mechanism and implementation of Palmar filter and particle filter from experiment is very interesting for me. And these method let me know more about map building in SLAM framework.
10132,Great way to learn GIS for anyone with no experience in the field/software.
10133,"Great Introductory Course. It is a bit short on course content, but reaches you enough to be able to learn from other sources such as research papers, etc."
10134,Great course for people familiar with programming and want to extend their knowledge into the realm of data.
10135,A truly helpful and interesting course!
10136,Awesome assignment!
10137,"I saw this course recommended by a commented on packer news. It is really an amazing course. Because I've read a lot about the topic previously, most of the ideas were not new to me, but some definitely were, and the presentation just explained everything extremely concisely and linked everything together brilliantly. It had one great idea after another after another, with lots of information packed tightly in a small space (more since I watched it at x with closed nations). I got a lot out of this and took a bunch of notes, and am eager to try many ideas in practice, especially the ones having to do with procrastinator, product/process, and the reward step for habits."
10138,Great course for learning not only the way the universe work but also the way we have learned it!
10139,"Great course, smooth flow and easy to follow"
10140,Good for states. But could have been more practical than theoretical.
10141,thank you
10142,"His class was bizarre. Some of the content and lectures was fantastic, but some lectures were quite dull and some lectures and quires were poorly written and misleading. The class was also strangely designed and executed: the amount of content per week varied significantly; the vast majority of the content was in a very specific energy sector (biofuels) and other key sector were almost entirely overlooked; it also seems like the content is already a few years old. It was more of a description of UCSD's research than of the ""future of the energy""."
10143,Very fun and very useful!
10144,"Awesome, useful, intuition, and applicable."
10145,Create course for beginners.
10146,"Excellent introductory course that I enjoyed a lot. Level was good - some was easy, some requested some more intense focus. Especially the terminology and the names of all the brain regions ;-)Geoffrey (The Netherlands)"
10147,"Thanks for practical tasks and cross-checking practice. It was fun to review other's work and have critics from your peers.Regards, Vladimir"
10148,Excellent course for beginners!
10149,Red Mind Bricks 101
10150,Amazing Course. To very enlightening and so very well taught. The quires help to reinforce the material learnt in the Lectures.The quit question made it so that you had to constantly think clinically to answer real world problem scenario.Would recommend it to anyone to gain a good understanding of Software Processes and Agile Practices.
10151,useful senibilisation ..... very well driven
10152,Keeps your interest! Great!
10153,Facilitator well articulate the concept of learning and steps of learning. It is also easy to understand and practice along the way!
10154,Great way to start Internet of things and Embedded System journey if you're new to the subject.
10155,"It was a great prime if you are not familiar with this area. Especially topics like the DCF and different of vehicles from a legal perspective can be hard to summarize into something tangible and short. The only recommendation I would make is a bit of brushing up on the wording, as it is sometimes hard in the quires to understand what exactly the question is (does the question relate to the previous question vs overall, etc)"
10156,great learning !
10157,"It really helps me to improve my english skill! That's why I recommend everybody to pass through this course (especially, if you have an intermediate level)."
10158,I feel like the courses have been too close to the information you can get through their linked webster. I think this is overall a very good introduction and was very helpful.
10159,It was a very interesting course. Thank you!
10160,"Good content, engaging presentation"
10161,"I liked it a lot. Not sure I learned a whole lot new, but isn't it so helpful to spend 6 weeks immersed in practice? I think so! He clearly had way more into than he could go through in six weeks -- you could tell by the number of guest speakers, extra research students could do. He did a great job condensing and picking out the most basic and core elements. A lot of group effort -- first course I've taken where I've seen how MANY people were involved in pulling it off...."
10162,this course is very poorly structures.
10163,"Is this entire course going to be watching video of powerpoint slideshows, wrapped in a rather buggy webster?"
10164,"Great into to patron, thanks."
10165,Have is great!
10166,"Bacteria are among the most import forms of life that ever existed, and to comprehend its biology is pivotal to human welfare and health. His course delivered with flare high education from one of the most religious universities in Europe. I strongly recommend this incredibly interesting course to anyone who wants to learn about the fascinating world of biofilms and chronic infections."
10167,Basic but you still learn a lot ! Moved the way it was put together... Really entertaining course.
10168,very good explanations :)
10169,"Interesting course on how the started ecosystem was build in Cleveland, Ohio. Especially interesting was to tell and read about how the started ecosystem in the Netherlands and the countries of the fellow students look like. I would recommend this course when you're interested in how started ecosystems work (and why sometimes they don't work)"
10170,I would give five stars BUTI wish that it isn't a must to finish R program.
10171,Very well explained by the instructor. Coursera is a very good platform for learning.
10172,Great content.
10173,I found this course to be very useful in shaping my analysis career. Any thanks to course for providing me the financial aid to pursue this course.
10174,"Great Content, PLEASE FIX of credit for course."
10175,"Very practical, makes easy for the student to go over the installation and configuration hubs, to-the-point introduction to Ruby on Nails. It the end of this course, I was able to write a decent looking web application, develop an understanding of the core concepts, and obtain many references to the helpful technologies and documentation. His course might have been better only if it were revised for the versions of 2017: if the student ignores the specificity of the versions in the initial installation instructions, the final homework will to be rejected by the automatic grade. Short put, most recent Nails version is not compatible with Ruby 4.2.x."
10176,"His course is really intuition and easy to understand, even if you don't have much practice programming. Also it is very clear, i highly recommend this course."
10177,Great introduction to the Python programming language. Although the assignment marking seems a little rigid and tends to mark you down despite written functions achieving the expected outcome.
10178,A nice quick introduction to game development and to Unity Of framework.
10179,"Useful, interesting and important course of high quality. To recommend!"
10180,"GRAN CURSO, MUY RECOMENDABLE, ABORDA of FORMA MUY COMPLETA of TEMA FUNDAMENTAL PARA CUALQUIER PERSONA."
10181,Very useful course. It talks about simple things but often it is these simple rules that we overlook while making our presentations/reports.
10182,"I like how the lectures are delivered. It is very engaging, and the content has been very useful. Level of details is also good for me."
10183,Short video with lost of good information.
10184,"this course is very useful and helpful, and it was made very careful, I would like to recommend it to my friends."
10185,Great course with plenty of new ideas and learning tips.
10186,"Very interesting, Open new point of view for more exploring."
10187,"A great lectures, I really like the attitude of this professor. He is really into his subject and I appreciated his resolution, when it comes to reducing the legacy of his favorite sociologists, into just one crucial point.Not five stars for quires, the parts concerning reading of classic could be much more motivation, in the aspect of the actual reading and understanding.Wish the course from University of Amsterdam on modern authors to come sooner."
10188,His course might be a bit complicated for someone who is using expel for the first time but for the people who have some basic knowledge it is a great platform to enhance their skill. The step by step process makes it easy to understand and the practice assignment give a great opportunity to test what we have learned in real life case studies.
10189,"I want to thank you for this wonderful course ""learning how to learn: powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects"" Or. Barbara Valley, Or. Terence Sejnowski and Sicca Mud.With the knowledge that you have invested in this training, I learned the method of ""Pomodoro"" and better learned about the capabilities of your brain. Believe in themselves and understand how to circumvented pitfalls on the path of my thoughts. And figured out how to conquer procrastinator, which is actually very important.Thank you and success in science.Evgeniy Arkhipov."
10190,Now I know better and I can approach my career in a more professional way.Thank you very much sir.
10191,"The course is so great. I d suggest Coursera promotes it to be passed by most of derbies visitors of the webster as it really encourages to study new subjects; and obviously, Coursera is the easiest way to learn new skill"
10192,"His is a cool course, and helps me a lot! Thank you!"
10193,Must have if you begin to learn cava.
10194,"I enjoyed taking this course. It was my first touch with Html, CSS and Javascript... and I can say that I learnt a lot."
10195,His course presents many alternatives to traditional models of business.
10196,"The course was very interesting and thought-provoking. I found the introduction to probabilistic graphics models (PGMs) and their properties struck a nice balance between intuition and formality. The discussions highlight exciting aspects of their power in simplifying complex problems involving uncertainty. However, I still do not feel I could propose convincing PGMs for real-world problems. There are examples in the course, but they are far removed from being concrete applications. I would have preferred there be an in depth analysis of an application of PGMs in the literature over the lengthy programming assignment. I am an experienced programme with over 5 years of experience in many languages including MATLAB/Active and I sometimes found it inspiring to solve toy problems, not due to the difficulty in using the programming language, but rather because after the assignment had been completed I felt I had not really learnt much more than I would have from just watching the lectures, although, if you are interested in getting experience with MATLAB/Active, the programming assignment are good practice. I qualify this in stating that I have not yet completed the next two courses on PGMs; this course may present an essential foundation that is necessary for the coming courses, and in any case provoked my interest in learning more about them"
10197,Amazing course. I learned allot.
10198,Very basic
10199,Good precious insight of the marketing in this present era.Thank you very much.Too
10200,"The HTML and CSS portions as well as the beginning javascript lessons are great. However, towards the end of this module the instructor seem to stop teaching and/or expect knowledge way above 'beginning' that make it necessary for me to teach myself way more than I expected."
10201,Simply a great course. Good into to machine learning classification.
10202,"It is a very nice course, although I was expecting something a little deeper / denser on both statistics and SAS programming. It is getting better on Nodule 2! =)"
10203,Its great
10204,"Excellent course - a great overview even for people new to the field. Great, entertaining lecture video!"
10205,"Yes, this is not for beginners.The assignment since weeks is beyond what was taught in class. I have to pay another 25 dollars on datacamp and finish 10+ courses, spending 2 weeks at least. To back to the assignment, without success. The learning curve is a bit tough. Anyway, I'm kind of newby on programming, will continue learning this one."
10206,Interesting course! I learned a lot from this course and from my peers. Thank you so much for offering it.
10207,I definitely would recommend more essential books and maybe TED Talks as well.Great books on communication were written by William UryGetting to YesGetting to Yes with yourself (essential book)Beyond Reasonhttps://www.amazon.de/Getting-Yes-Yourself-Worthy-Opponents/up/0062390678/red=sr_1_6?in=UTF8&did=1479132707&s=8-6&keywords=William+cry
10208,"His course provides very interesting information about how our brain works, and how through effective technique we can improve our abilities to learn any topics."
10209,Excellent course! Learning how to get the web data step by step. Easy to start my patron career!
10210,His course is one of the best courses I have taken! Projects are based on the real datasets and gives you lots of insight about what you can do!
10211,Professor Miller is amazing in not only his knowledge of all areas of Finance but his delivery to all the students is so refreshing and genuine that he pulls you into every subject with the excitement of wanting to learn and understand more about it's history and importance in today's world. I came to this class wanting to visit all the subjects in the Financial Markets and be updated based on the current happening locally in relationship to those. Excellent class!
10212,His class is so good for entry level.Prof Andrew G. Thank you.
10213,"excellent, I am very happy to achieve this course."
10214,Thank you Andrew G
10215,best than first part
10216,The course gives a very good overview of the current state of knowledge about our universe and is simply to understand.
10217,The subtitles once not match with the advance of the video.
10218,Vice and... short ;]
10219,"First time, ı said what am ı suppose to do with that, and then noticed, people and companies cares this teach whole over the world. His is just the beginning. keep doing keep learning .He will change our world, together!"
10220,The course was information and stretched me a bit.
10221,"Excellent course and very good into to Unity. Sides, assignment and everything really helped to become familiar with Unity and adopt good practices when making projects."
10222,"He were presented a totally new approach to innovation and entrepreneurship, which was very interesting and inspiring. Prof. Shlomo Capital provides us with an impulse to go through an experience and transformation stages (as per Fillmore and Line of).Or. Professor ! Thanks for spending time with us and sharing your knowledge and wisdom."
10223,Moved the content - delivered well!
10224,His course has increased my knowledge about the economy and especially about emerging markets and bonds. Thank you for this great course!
10225,The nodules were reader friendly and very easy to follow. There is no written paper required for this course. All you need to do is watch the presentations and keep on track.
10226,Yakov Chaikin is great - he made it easy for me to learn and finally use AngularJS - I wish him good colonies for x-was and everything that is good!
10227,His is an outstanding introduction to machine learning and one of the original courses that started the recent MOOC expansion. The course provides an excellent understanding of various algorithmic approaches as well as information on how to select and tune the right model for the right situation. I wish the Swedes would create a Noble Prize for Education and give the first one to Andrew G.
10228,Well done. I learned a lot with this. Simple and complex at same time :)
10229,Teacher is great
10230,Excellent Course! Great educators!
10231,Great class! Awesome teacher! Subject was easy to understand and great instructions video.
10232,"Excellent course! Excellent professor, great pedagogical methods used, a very accessible language and very good quality information. And the book is awesome! Thanks for unloading it."
10233,"You can really feel the passion and experience the facilitators have on this OPV subject, even via the video. His course is a must for people interested to delve into OPV, especially as a starting point for research. The course covers into detail almost from cradle to grave about OPV, and what I like most is that they highlight a lot of previous and current experiments and research regarding OPV. Some of the quires can be a bit challenging as a few of them require 100% to pass. But all in all, 5 stars for me. Congratulations on a course well done."
10234,incredible course！
10235,excellent course to get basic knowledge about plants and its related parts
10236,Great course! Great teacher!
10237,Great course and great instructor!
10238,It's really worth of it taking all the time to run through every programming exercise. On't know how many thanks I should say to Andrew G.
10239,To complaints. His course revealed in more interested in the interpersonal dynamic of influence and persuasion vs the logic of arguments.
10240,"Well designed course for the beginners who anna be future leaders. The skill such as performance, leadership, negotiation was taught. Good to be a part of this course in Northwestern through course.Cheers!"
10241,A very fascinating course if you're interested in learning the inner workings of why people behave the ways they do.
10242,Vice into to software product management.
10243,A great opportunity to learn and experience the first steps to start a new venture!
10244,"Very nice to receive such an in-depth overview of the entire course before starting. Also: great instructions on how to get help, I'm sure I'll need it!"
10245,great and succinct course
10246,"Good and insightful. Felt there were some assumptions being made that should be questioned, but, overall, it was a very enjoyable class with an enjoyable teacher. Have me some information I'm passing onto my daughter on her journey through middleschool also."
10247,Really great experience and a must for every learner!
10248,"Initially the accent was a little bit hard to understand, but after few minutes everything become crystal clear. Extremely useful course content."
10249,"His course in an excellent introduction to supervised and supervised machine learning. It doesn't only tell you which algorithms exist and how to implement them, but also gives lots of advice about how to solve machine learning problems in practice."
10250,"The course is a great course in terms of the knowledge and experience of the instructor and the helpfulness of the staff. I gave it 2 stars for two reasons.1) The video are deceptive short. In MOOC instructions design, you normally design short video because the attention span of an online learner is tends to be much shorter than an in-person university student. However, in this course, even though the video is short, it is really 5-10 times longer because they speed over the equations and teaching so fast that you have to pause and reply and remind and reply several times while trying it yourself. To the tidings are not truly accurate. Of you were actually teaching it in a classroom with actual students you would go much more slowly. In this case, I wish they were more honest with the times by actually tying the code in real time while teaching. I would have preferred a lecture to make it more digestive.2) The hardest thing for me about the course was the fact that instead of practicing computational thinking within data science (decomposition, algorithmic thinking, etc.), I was really just searching on stick overflow for how to put it into patron. It's poor instructions design to only teach something and expect students to complete assignment without giving them all the tools they will use in the assignment. It would be ok if it were an accidental mistake, but this seems to be purposeful. His happened not just in course assignment but sometimes even in mid-roll video-overlaid quires where the answer was something not explained or taught or shown. His was really strange to me and caused a huge amount of time to be spent searching online or trying mid-lecture problems to no avail. It cause all the tidings of the course to be off (#1 caused the video tidings to be severely off and #2 meant that the course assignment estimates were HUGELY miscalculated). Good instructions design would mean that the professor should show all the tools one could use to faithfully complete and achieve the assignment. For some reason that was avoided again and again in this course.Great material though. I loved learning. I just wish it were better structures and supported and that I learned more about the work rather than just searching online for how to write something."
10251,"Brilliant! It may sounds overenthusiastic, but this course enriched my life dramatically. I've got a completely new perspective on how to learn. Even only two weeks after passing the final test and finishing this course I can touch my learning process has improved up to a new level, both in terms of effectively and efficiency.Bottom Line: It doesn't matter who you are or what you are specializing in - do this course!"
10252,Excellent and well structures course in Macroeconomics by Prof. Navarro.
10253,It's a big challenge for me to write an essay each week. But I'm really happy to attend this course since I learn a lot from it :)
10254,Perfect!
10255,"Really a great course, with focus on the concepts and mathematics of image processing . More academic type course rather than a hands on one. Less weight given to video processing. I wish there was a bit more programming and practical assignment to accompany this compendium of DSP knowledge .Thanks clot!"
10256,"The subject of the course is very interesting. Lectures are very engaging and professors do a great job explaining abstract concepts. In the other hand, assignment are extremely difficult and frustration. The lack of feedback for the assignment leaves you with important knowledge gaps and that's a serious flaw for a course that offers so much most of the time."
10257,Another good course on Epidemiology!
10258,"Very interactive, the professor is amazing, loved it"
10259,"Joyful learning from Professor Charles, I love it"
10260,you can do the final thing unless you pay so That minutes 2 stars.
10261,One of the richest course I've ever taken. The quires even help me to have a better understanding about the content of the course. Highly recommend to master and pad students particularly in social science.
10262,"Great course for beginners, simple and encouraging. I highly recommend it!"
10263,"Of course, its a nice course but the calculations were little more for me to understand as I am a Medical doctor. I enjoyed the course. Thanks one and all for helping me to understand the course"
10264,Excellent source of information.
10265,Good chance for earners to indulge more practically than just theoretical work.
10266,"His course was great to get a start in Data Science. I thought the lectures and the course notes were very well presented and served as a good resource for the assignment. The use of Jupiter notebook was especially helpful. I found the course forms also very helpful in debugging my code. I have some previous experience with Pythons so the level of the assignment was easy enough that I didn't feel overwhelmed, but challenging enough for me do a lot of independent study.A criticism I have is that the Jupiter notebook kept logging me off so saving assignment regularly failed and I had to red work often.I usually don't pay for courses on Coursera, but the quality of this was so good that I will definitely continue with the specialization."
10267,Brilliant introduction to machine learning.Take me want to learn more and use it for actual competition.
10268,Lecturer is actually socrates
10269,In excellent class. It helped me sharpen up my writing. I would say this is better than any book I ever read on writing. A huge part of it was in the reading and reviewing of other student's work. I felt I learned even more in doing that.
10270,"I just finished the course and I want to say it is pretty details and covers a huge variety of topics in machine learning. The problems I had with this course is specifically with the quires and programming assignment; I would get stuck with no idea of what the correct way is to solve it, what I'm doing wrong, or sometimes I don't even know what the question wants me to do. However, with perseverance, I was able to get through every one of them."
10271,"Interesting online course as introduction with brief concepts and definitions on diplomacy, its role, influence and interaction in the modern world. Recommend others to attend this online course to gain required into knowledge on diplomacy."
10272,It was a great course!
10273,Moved the course. Well presented and interesting.
10274,"loved it; first it it free; then, we were provided with weekly exercises and valuable of about the course; definitely worth the investment"
10275,great course
10276,Very well developed and structures course. Thank you. I was taking other courses related to of but this one is the best due to its reliance on PMI requirements and definitions. His course helped me a lot during my preparation on obtaining a of mortification.
10277,"very nice speech and matas labrotary design!!! By the way, of can give us advanced topics with matas programming excise? Thank you!"
10278,Excellent Course with extremely detailed lectures.
10279,West into programming series I've taken. Or. Chuck is the best.
10280,Excellent course.I learned lot of valuable things.Thank you.
10281,"Have is such a great teacher. I have learned a lot from him during this module and I can already apply all the technique in the classroom and also while advising the teachers of the school I am a assistant coordinate at. Thank you, Have, Coursera and ASU!"
10282,very challenging :) learned a lot.
10283,"I am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coming, but there wasn't any. In any case, thanks Or Chuck! :-)"
10284,Very basic into suited for highschool students. Any errors in transcripts that you will just have to slow through.
10285,There's a lot of material and it's hard to grasp it all. Hopefully that will improve as the course continues.
10286,"Excellent Course to know the basis of all aspects Windenergy like, Costing, Design, Various parameter involved in Design and stallion of of, and Present and future and etc"
10287,Thanks Charles Severance please keep going with such amazing Courses. That you do is priceless.print ('You are the best')One pythonic
10288,A very useful guide to beginner Chinese.
10289,very nice fundamentals. I like the way they begin with the most basic elements. When add on additional incremental elements to make the projects more sophisticated and our knowledgebase more sophisticated.
10290,"His course is easy to understand, show how is excitanting create responsive pages and the teacher is amazing."
10291,"In excellent course for those new or seasoned to marketing. He live in a digital world and if you own your own business, work for a large company or are a freelancer (like me) you can grow your business and benefit from this class. Seriously do yourself a favor and take this class!!"
10292,"His is clearly not the right medium for Prof Clinton. His was inferior to the first installment, which had a great many problems on its own. Door on camera delivery, lack of familiarity with the material and a tendency to just read the PPT slide on the screen are just a few of the problems. While the content is good you really have to work to get through the presentation of the material."
10293,"I think this one is the best from the Specialization as it is the most Practical one (more than Practical Machine Learning).An be taken without the others if you have basic experience in R and want to learn about cool R applications.The reason I don't give full rating is for not having practical assignment every week. To there wasn't enough effort put into the course. Of course, we can do optional homework and make more applications, but assignment like these should be mandatory. There is no package building and no will course building - To why do we have week 3 and 4 at all? The quires are also laughable - no knowledge testing at all.To although I liked this course from the Specialization the most, I still can't give full rating because of the mentioned issues."
10294,A great course. Not only information but introspective.
10295,A powerful learning program for everyone. To glad to join and complete this course. His makes study and learning much easier. Thank you.
10296,Great Introduction
10297,His course is a great way to start learning and applying machine learning concepts and algorithms. Andrew G does a great job at intuitively and thoroughly explaining the concepts presented in this course. I highly recommend it to anyone that is interested in machine learning.
10298,Great course!!!!
10299,Someone needs to review/proofread the final part and assignment. Any students were/are confused about the final assignment. Devise the video too.
10300,qualified teachers and modern teaching methods.
10301,I have learnt a lot of English and eating healthy with this course. It is all very well explained.
10302,"Really simple yet effective! I am able to understand the basis of mandarim thanks to this awesome course, the University of Seizing, and of course, Coursera! Thank you so much!"
10303,It was very hard but extremely fearful.
10304,Great course!!
10305,"Very simple and easy to follow instructions. The lessons, exercises, and peer reviews are all interesting. I learned so much from this module. Thank you!"
10306,Oooh easy
10307,Interesting tips on some important points when designing a game
10308,His is excellent course for teachers
10309,"It was pretty information. Some things felt too rushed, but I definitely learned how to use the basis of Unity."
10310,well taught!! :)
10311,Great for people who would like to grasp the very concepts and basis of making a functional game.
10312,"Very comprehensive and thorough introduction to game design. I gained lots of insight into what it really takes to be a developer, and the steps involved. His course really helped to explain the process of getting a game idea off the ground, flushing out details, and making it presentable to a team or prospective producer. Thanks!"
10313,Great course.
10314,I think for me this is a walk over. [as at 4 June 2016 in week 1 of the course]
10315,"By first course at Coursera, it's wonderful and exactly what I need."
10316,Very useful and professional!
10317,"Extremely good course to start with machine learning. Clears basic concepts without going into too much detail which makes it ideal for students with no background in calculus. Also, the structure and content is well organized and topics are not rushed upon. You not only learn algorithms but also best practices to follow to achieve better accuracy. The programming exercises are also really good. All of this makes coupled with the helpful Coursera community to guide you when you are stuck- up with a problem makes it an ideal course to start learning machine learning."
10318,"Very information, really good speed and content. Vice examples to illustrate the learning."
10319,"Vice for a first approach, easy to follow. Good content."
10320,"Image-making will let you appreciate how a design is formed. Having finished the course, I look at designs now as more than just a representation of something. I see designs now as art forms, styled to express not only its connotative meaning but its decorative meaning as well."
10321,"A great learning and training for the PMP exam, thank you for this treasure !"
10322,"Of you're looking for learning and practicing your english and busssines skill, this is quite the best course you can take undoubtedly!!!"
10323,It was excellent!
10324,Great Projects!
10325,His course is interesting where it develops your understanding in International Relations and Diplomacy protocol. I love the course to strengthen my knowledge on Foreign Policy. Happy study
10326,Very practical and hands on course. I really enjoyed it a lot and definitely learned a lot from it.
10327,great course ! nice explanations and really well focused
10328,Well structures course
10329,TESOL online is a dream come true. The best part is with the way the course is build and dealt. :-)
10330,I always dreaded Statistics. His course made me really understand the basis of statistics. Well explained and good examples.Thanks
10331,Great Course
10332,Professor Whig is a real expert on the topic.
10333,His course is very comprehensive and eye opening. Concrete historical information but also very theoretical.
10334,"Great course! I like how it explained basic ideas of setting up an investment portfolio. And how it went into detail, such as rheumatic investing."
10335,so far excellent. After first week.
10336,very good course and useful
10337,Thank you for this amazing course! it's a great complement for data science!
10338,"Thank you Or. Valley, I learn how to learn, and for my next class I feel confident I will be successful."
10339,The video are great. The activities are fine. The final activity needs more structure/scaffolding.
10340,Vice Course. Great information.
10341,Awesome Course . Detail and Depth of RDD vs Dataframe vs Dataset.Agency vs Network/of vs Shuffling.Learnt a lot .Thank you Weather.
10342,"Need a good foundation with knowledge of calculus(integral), electrical engineering and wave and caustics. Not just a course to pick up for fun."
10343,Good into
10344,Good course.
10345,"It would be great if there are more exercises to fix the concept, but great course!"
10346,There is a large gap between the course material and the assignment. Requires A LOT of extra research to complete if you do not have prior R experience.
10347,"The teachers are fantastic. The content is introductory, but it covers a lot of information in an easy and clear way. Also, it helped me to pass the exam to enter into a Master's program in Epidemiology. It was really helpful, even more than some very well-known introductory books on the field. Thank you, it was great!!"
10348,His course is really excellent for beginners in machine learning
10349,Good basic information for every parent to know.All of us should make time to cook wealthier food for our families.
10350,"The course addresses quite precisely and dramatically every aspect regarding young athletes anatomical and physiological development. All the information provided in the lectures is research-based and Or. Brooks states clearly when she is providing information which needs further investigation or clarification. The length of the lectures is short and these are very well organized by nodules, facilitating the learning process. The information is almost always related to its application to young populations. While the topics covered by the course represent a fair amount of the information a coach should have, psychological and social aspects, which are quite important for training young athletes, are not covered in depth. The assessment lack effective feed-back to support the learning process, given that after taking the quires you will only know if your answer was right or wrong, missing any instruction about the course content itself, and the only peer-possessed piece misses a feed-back section which may help to improve future writing."
10351,Watched my interest. Concise and comprehensive to learn about learning. I'd like to visit the material again and again for the future use.
10352,"Easy to follow, and good contents"
10353,A must for retail stars!
10354,It's a bit hard to answer the quit since the presentation is not speaking about the qu
10355,Great refreshed on grammar and punctuation.
10356,"Good course on the various Is, legal needs, technology needs and what it means to be And. Packed details on how you go about running a business .. so lets say I wanted to start a business analysis consulting firm besides getting a business number what else do I need to hire people, earn revenue and run the business profitable."
10357,Very good but slightly basic. Great starting point.
10358,His course is lifechanging. Highly recommended.
10359,"Any ""good to know"" things both for professional but even for simple things in life like buying an new apartment or go out and buy anything. Highly recommended."
10360,His is a great course and I strongly recommend it!
10361,Very information!
10362,Very Good...
10363,"I found it very interesting I learned that many of the things that we do to help people are actually called intervention and are valuable skill. I like the order, the vocabulary and the examples. That I don't like is the price of the certificate I will be willing to pay no more than 30 ills. I am interested in many courses but I can't pay 45 ills. For each :("
10364,Absolutely loving this course. The instructor are brilliant. Indeed a very information course.
10365,did not like the course at all. That is why I decided to discontinue the course.
10366,Would have been better. Expected some interaction/video from the senators.
10367,Such a brilliant course. His has been the starting point for my career in machine learning. Thank you professor Andrew.
10368,Very good course with teaching the way to learn how to trading and learning trading algorithms.
10369,"In amazingly deep dive for an into course: covers generals, pattern watching, immutable data structures in lectures. Week 3 had some issues with the grade root and exponential run times if you wrote some bad code."
10370,"Going this course was indeed a very good experience. I am looking to change my career and trying to learn computer programming and which is exactly why I have done this course. After finishing the course, I believe it is not only my study that is being helped, I believe I have got a very good amount of real life tips as well which will help me in my career as well. Being a procrastinator, I have harmed my life already a lot. But now that I know how to handle procrastinator, I will try my best to implement the tricks that I have learned in this course. Thanks a lot!"
10371,"Good course, tough, but good. Very engaging for those interested in Epidemiology. Lots of detail! I walked away learning much from this course."
10372,thank you professor
10373,A definite course to take. You learn so much and enjoy doing it. An't recommend enough.

10375,Very interesting ! -)
10376,Clear and insightful explanation.
10377,"Great practical advice presented in an overview. For me, professors who have real-world experience - and clearly Professor Standen does - are the best teachers. I will be looking for more courses from UCI, hopefully with this professor."
10378,"A well structures and captivating course which gets interesting as it progresses. Lots of enriching interviews, examples from experts on green practices. Stimulating your thought process this course helps you to think out of the box."
10379,Very good course raising nutrition and healthy awareness to this generation.
10380,great course
10381,"Before I took this course I took the Stanford Machine Learning course, which I greatly enjoyed. That course allows for the learning of difficult concepts in a way that I found less painful than working through a textbook. In this course there is a lot less video content, and the coming assignment are less interesting. Expect to spend a lot of time understanding the glances of the code that the instructions team has developed, and be prepared to really more over the gritty aspects of Active or MATLAB. Of you're serious about this course I suggest buying the accompanying book. The sides are not easy to understand without the audit narration, which makes them difficult to review, and unlike the case in the of course, there are not a lot of readily available open introduction written on the topics."
10382,Superb course. Great presentation and course material. Projects are challenging but fun at the same time. Highly recommend for all levels of software developer.
10383,"I really enjoy the course. I learn a lot of things about food that i didn't know.In the other hand I realized I was wrong about the amount of food we eat , the portions and the way of thinking about food.It's a very interesting course, the material is very clear. I enjoyed very much!!!Greetings from Colombia"
10384,Love it! His is my first forty into model thinking. I wish there is a better way to say thanks to Professor Age.
10385,"His is one of the best series of courses I came along in online MOOC platform, such a brilliant course, this whole specialization is brilliant, such a interesting projects, I'm disappointed that I live in country that isn't that much wealthy to help this Specialization and to be able to do Capstone Project , but I wish all the best hope to finish all in time, this is in my top 3 online MOOC Courses and I saw a lot of them.I wish all the best to this team and people that made this possible."
10386,It was difficult to me! I think that 's more appropriate to whom is already familiarized with the terms and concepts.
10387,"Excellent course! I have already recommended it to several co-workers and people in my field of work. Is a trained birth would, I have received necessary tools to assist parents and relatives after traumatic birth experience, as well as, have a list of relevant resources available to continue their support and recovery when it is out of the scope of my practice and training. I am also happy to be equip with this training for the needs of the community in emergency situations.Thank you."

Real hands-on approach to show the basic and essential concepts about how to interface with database using as a tool the embedded quite, how to correctly define normalized tables, and how to implement important design patterns."
10418,Very useful.
10419,"A great course I will recommend to everyone, period.Vice hosts, useful concepts, fun throughout the course but serious approach."
10420,"Great course, so interesting, I learned so much. It is presented well and helps you to be methodical and taught me to analyse with a new perspective. I find I am now able to understand better the scientific papers that are published. It is such a shame that it is over, but Intend to continue with my studies. The additional material at the end of each lesson is a great idea which causes you to research even more. Of you have an interest in these fantastic creatures, how they came to be and why they disappeared, apart from the birds of course, then this is the course for you and you don't have to have a degree to complete this course, just an inquiring mind. S. ATKINS"

10443,Very useful any knowledge acquiring course
10444,Very practical course. Proffesor has good tips and very easy to understand explanations and practical examples.
10445,"Explored the basis concepts of problem-solving, and they can appear easy and logical; but when you try to apply them, you can notice that it's not so basic and you can really nurtured with this course."
10446,"Excellent course, this is the first MOOC course I have ever started taking. I appreciated the organization of the content that Andrew G put together, especially the programming assignment that helped me in a significant way to improve my understanding to the content, to spot out my misunderstandings, and to leave me with a good source codes for the future applications of machine learning easily."
10447,The West Course in Accounting Analytics.
10448,Fantastic course! Prof Charles is clear when he speaks and his passion is infectious :) Not to mention his sense of humor!
10449,"In excellent course as a short overview or as an introduction to a specialization.Seemed to touch on neurology and evolution more than genetic. Didn't get into the mechanics of genetic or molecular biology as much as I had hoped. Head Genetic for Summits and reviewed my old textbook to refresh on topics I found interesting and this was a nice course to accompany that endeavor. I really enjoyed the short segment near the end that delve into the field of biotechnology.Thank you so much for providing this as a self-paced class, I really enjoyed taking it."

10464,Very good way to start learning julia
10465,very good course :)
10466,I really enjoyed this course. There were ideas that really helped me defined my idea. I love the presentation. I would suggest breaking some of the longer nodules into smaller parts. Add another Ruin on the third and th lesson. I do love this specialization. I am going to keep going.
10467,"Excellent course, but the english of the professors can improve..."
10468,"Great Course, i highly encourage everyone who needs to know how reaching is done either in your professional life or even personal life to attend it."

10475,good course. professor tries to sell his book too much. it's emma
10476,"Now, didn't expect that programming is for everyone! Will start tonight on the next course!"
10477,Great high-level overview of a lot of topics! Very lecture was very well explained. The written assignment and programming exercises were a good balance between getting your hands dirty while still being paced that you could finish them all in a timely manner and finish the course with a busy schedule. I had fun!
10478,"Excellent Course, Material and Professor ."
10479,awesome course! I plan to use few of the technique for my life not just on studying but other aspects as well.

10485,Incredible continuation of an already amazing course.
10486,"Very good, felt like we could have done more work with hands on file writing and coming but it was nice to build off of someone else."
10487,I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone who's paying. The assignment instructions are too vague to understand and there's no example given.
10488,"The course was excellent, with very good structure, with the right level of difficulty/complexity, with very good sides & discussions. The only couple of points for potential amendments that I would propose is a) avert from calling/mentioning drugs with their brand names, but rather use the active ingredient names only, and b) perhaps providing resources for further reading (i.e web links etc) to all material after each lecture, like you did for week 6 final lecture."
10489,very nice course ...lot of things learn from this course
10490,Good Introductory course for JavaScript.!
10491,so well explained - and some real world experience shared.Well done.
10492,Fantastic course

10494,"Very good introduction to patron. Or Chuck is a very friendly, affable teacher. The textbook is free. The load of this class is not so heavy. I really enjoyed the class."
10495,"Amazing course, the characterizations of the approaches were great and the explanations simple but direct, so I loved it.!"
10496,it is so helpful to understand big data
10497,I wish the course covered machine learning. Looking forward for part of
10498,"His course is well-designed and delivered by the experienced instructor. It is particularly suitable for those who have some basic knowledge in programming (knowing how to use if-else if-else statements, for-loop and while-loop, etc.; knowing a little bit how to write a simple code in C, C++, Python or others) and would like to enhance his programming technique through abolishing his logical thinking ability while he is designing a algorithm."
10499,I am really thankful to Or. Chuck and all Coursera team.
10500,"Thanks to this course, I think economically my society and the world. His strengthen my economic wisdom. Thank you."
10501,"Excellent course. I have no experience in this field so I took it out of curiosity and learned a lot. Very well taught, very well organized, covered just the right amount of material. Does take a bit of a commitment, I would suggest keeping up, it only takes a couple of hours per week. It made me want to learn more about the field."
10502,Great course for frenchman on machine learning.
10503,"His course have change my way of learning, it will help me a lot to be a better learner"
10504,"Thank you, Professor Scott Weisbenner, for an excellence course that you put your heart and passion (for Star Wars) into."
10505,Excellent course! Excellent Teacher! Excellent knowledge!!
10506,His course covers the topics well in lectures and the concepts are resented through the programming exercises. Information is a bit scattered for the assignment but students are made aware of this early on. I would definitely recommend this course.
10507,Great course!
10508,"The course was absolutely what we need and understand the Saber Security from a course. Special thank you to Professor Or Chuck he made Easy to understand the subject and all useful information. Always to the point. The online presentation was excellent and dealt with all the relevant information needed to understand why of Security is so important to the individual and also employers. The course explained the InfoSec mechanics, I would also like to say that the course was presented in such a way that most if not all people would understand every single section covered. To, a highly recommended course which anybody would enjoy and gain great knowledge."
10509,The first half of the course was great but and half was a bit disappointing.
10510,Thank you for making this course. It exceeds my expectation.
10511,Well prepared course
10512,The class covered a lot of new and very useful information that can apply to nearly anyone trying to learn a new skill. I know I will be checking back on my notes to make sure these concepts are applied and become habits.
10513,The Instructor is amazing!
10514,"Good, well paced course. Fig advantage is the short duration of the video-lectures. I prefer a few short ones over one long lecture."
10515,Very cool course advice to everyone. Well explained material and a lot of useful staff.
10516,Good course overall but I hoped to know more about polymer and advanced materials.
10517,"His has been a very helpful course, showing me how to program in a fun way because every coming challenge is linked to a biological question. I think the pace of the course was good, without any prior experience in coming I've had a few moments where I was stuck. But thankful with some patience and helpful replies from the teaching assistant of the course to my questions in the discussion, it was possible to get past those coming problems."
10518,Sides are too short
10519,"Really good for beginners and if this course have more detailed instruction of final assignment, I would like to give five stars."
10520,"In interesting course, the special theory of relatively easy for anyone to understand and very well explained."
10521,I love everything about this course. the course material is easy to follow. I also like the coming exercises. I highly recommend the specialisation so far (this is my second course)
10522,"Good content, good teacher. Create"
10523,"Great introductory course to the subject. Very little path background needed, and gives you good intuitions and very interesting engineering methodologies on how to effectively work on my systems (In my opinion this is the most interesting part of the course).Only one thing: since the course is introductory (very little theoretical material) it would be useful having directions by the (awesome) teacher on ""where to go next""."
10524,"Vice course,good video'give been in he of since 84 and seen most of it..."
10525,Learned a lot! Professor is very clear in explaining difficult concepts.
10526,A great introduction to the tools needed to be ready to handle data science.
10527,Any thanks Or. Chuck
10528,"great course , great start to of"
10529,Vice introduction to statistics and tools. Great instructor.
10530,"His course was fabulous. I was recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, and the information that is available to the general public on this disease provides little, if any, actual information on what the disease is, how it is caused, and why certain treatments, such as diet and exercise, work. His course was taught at a level that was challenging but it gave me the information I have been looking for. The sections on treatment option will be particularly helpful for me as I discuss my situation with my doctor."
10531,I liked the fact that the final tests need your code.... so if you do not understand what you have done you will fail :-)
10532,"Very helpful, thanks for the course!"
10533,A great introduction to slightly more complicated R programming. Basic concepts covered well and it build nicely to the point where you feel like you can apply your knowledge to real world examples
10534,Very interesting lectures!
10535,"I love this course, it is amazing. His course brought to my life a lots of inspiration. Thank you Or. Dam and her team."
10536,"Project description versus requirements were terrible, not sure if the new Coursera format played a role in the issues or not. Quite a few of the homework items require guessing as the answers don't align to the results of the latest tools they have you use. Of the first class or three in the series was like this I wouldn't have taken the courses."
10537,Prof Brain is just superb. His hold and teaching ability of complicated subject of accounting is snatched.
10538,I am interested in RNA-see data analysis and lecture 7 was superb. Thank you
10539,Awesome course)
10540,Great course. Enjoyed a lot.!
10541,"Very good lecturer, has very good command of English Language. Impressive"
10542,Great course! Thank you!
10543,Vice course for those who want to have first insight to Python programming
10544,His course is a great introduction physics. I am glad I could take the course.
10545,Very useful and relevant knowledge to have!
10546,Excellent short course on the management of protected areas in Africa. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in developing an understanding in protected area management.
10547,"Very well explained, at least from Google search engine sight and practical exercise."
10548,"His is a great course!!! I think the skill learnt here will be a lot of benefit to my life! Thank you, Prof. Siedel."
10549,"His course is so rich in content, and all this is delivered with great clarity and depth. Must wonderful!"
10550,Great content- video and assignment were fantastic.Little participation and interaction with staff and other participants makes the course lose a lot of its attractiveness- most of the concepts are not rocket science and one would really benefit from confrontation with other students.
10551,Informative.
10552,Fantastic course for an undergraduate like me. Not only for this undergraduate but also for the one's who like to enhance their learning ability better than before in any field. The age is not the constrain to understand the course material.
10553,His course is not prepared as well. You see several video with animated presentation and typical (vocabulary) terms.It is not for beginners because in course you didn't find answers.It is not for pro because in course you didn't find interesting material.Hope that instructor can change course to better.
10554,it's neat!
10555,Excellent prime course....just the entree...harder stuff is coming
10556,I'm very motivate taking this course and also I've been applying some technique that I learned. I encourage everyone to check out this course. Have a great weekend.
10557,Great course!
10558,I use taught methods and could manage time more efficiently.
10559,"The structure of the lectures as well as the assignment might need some design.In the lecture, I think it might be better to explain the algorithm very clearly without talking about any coming details first, and then have some lectures explaining the code implementation. Right now, the coming implementation and the algorithm explanations are mixed together in a way that is not really easy to digest.However, I really appreciate the solid content of this course. The markov assignment is a actual assignment copied from the CS201 course in Duke. Moreover, it is implements with even a more sophisticated and better desired structure. In the CS201, the concept of inheritance is not introduced yet. For all of you who made it to weeks assignment, you can applaud yourselves.Badly, the assignment design of this course is very disappointing. Despite its rich content, it requires the students to take a long time to adjust some details at some corner of the method to do the quit question. It is very error prone and tedious. The final quits need some simplification in the structure or format.Overall, I still recommend people taking this course. Very Good content. Must be prepared for the assignment, it really needs a considerable amount of patience and efforts."
10560,"There have been some undesirable references to equations, in terms of equaling modeling to economic growth and investment. I was interested by the syllabus and its outline of theories and the means to use models to study social sciences and systems sciences. After week 1, though, it was not a very interesting course so I considered trying to simply survey most of the video to gain some more information, not necessarily for any more insight from the Professor from the University of Michigan."
10561,"A crash course on infrastructure finance and investment, highly recommended!"
10562,this course is very clear.
10563,You are a marvelous teacher. It was a great learning for me
10564,"Headings were not necessary for the course and quires were extremely difficult, seeming to be worded in an attempt to stump students, and many questions were not from the course lessons. Sides very dry and boring."
10565,A useful course for anyone in chemical engineering. I enjoyed the material. Its well structures. Would be nice if Professor Wooldridge gave more example problems.
10566,The worst! I don't recommend you to take any course from this institute. It is just wasting time and money.
10567,I enjoyed this course because it opened up a nice array of new concepts in a clear and understandable way. It's always refreshing to find a well-planned course on Coursera.His is not to say that the course couldn't use a little bit of taking though. There are still a few areas where things could be made clearer.
10568,"A very nice introductory course that uses real-world use case examples to illustrate foundation concepts in machine learning. Of, like me, you have only an sinking about what is machine learning, this is a good course to give you a broad overview. Long the way, you'll pick up some very useful Python skill for use in data analysis. You'll also learn to use the nice Python tool, the iPython (Jupiter) Notebook."
10569,Concepts were presented clearly and in an organized fashion. The professors were very nice and reliable. 10/10 would recommend this to a friend
10570,His course is a joy!
10571,"The Javascript module, and specially the Tax part was more abstract and vague than the rest of the nodules and I honestly didn't get much of the Tax part. I learned a lot, though, and fully appreciate the amount of effort put into each lesson. Moved it!"
10572,THE most interesting lecturer I have found in recent times.Wonderfully enlightening approach to the subject.Thank you
10573,Moved the way they explained everything. But the tests are very easy.
10574,Good start with Fundamentals. Need to take more advanced courses to gain depth knowledge.
10575,"I am taking all courses in the specialization, and this is my fourth. I have been having a great time with materials by both instructor so far, until I came to week 5 of this course.Despite repeated viewing, my understanding of LDA is non-extent. The first section is fine, but starting from ""Bayesian inference via Limbs smiling,"" for me at least, the method of instruction has gone off a cliff.I strongly suggest soliciting feedback from earners that narrowly target the material of this week 5 to determine if it's just me or if this is a wider problem. Of it is the latter, perhaps it is time to design the lessons of this week."
10576,A firsthand essential course to get started in doing practical of. The course is useful.
10577,Great follow-up course to the foundations of everyday leadership.
10578,Excellent experience! Thank you everyone!!Julia
10579,"A great course, I love it."
10580,Very effective way of teaching
10581,The course content was good but teaching method was too poor to understand. First time little disappointment by course.com
10582,cool
10583,"Very good introduction to R, and its use of data structures, indexing, logical arguments, lexical sloping etc. The problems at the end really ensure you come away from this course with sufficient knowledge. Would recommend."
10584,"Excellent course, well presented and full of great information. Thank you for taking the time to offer it."
10585,His course is actually more information than the course for human physiology i took at university. I can stop watching the video.Thank you for the great content.
10586,I am quite pleased with the course. The professor was extremely thorough and presented the information is a clear and logical fashion. to
10587,learned so much and will recommend this course to others!!
10588,Amazing learning experience
10589,"His is really good. I expected a tedious review of my grammar subjects from grade school and high school. I am pleasantly relieved that the emphasis is on the areas that will be commonly used in academic writing; that is, sentence construction. I have learned a lot and have also discovered that my compound and complex sentence construction do need some work."
10590,A very good course. It is dreadful the knowhow of its instructor and the great quality of information and lectures. Thank you
10591,"Pleased with the topic covered in the first MOOC, bang on what I expected. looking forward to the next MOOCs on the topic. hats on to Or. Lava for his resonsiveness on"
10592,Rough! But worth it!
10593,"Very good course for learning Python, Thanks for providing opportunity to take your course."
10594,Fantastic course. Based on a lot of research and evidence. It does indeed reaches you how to be happier.
10595,it is a very useful course for the beginners. this course might be improved by adding one week for talking about the empirical literature on terrorist in political science field.
10596,Engaging and interesting content; well-taught; challenging and appropriate assessment.
10597,"Mandatory for every human being !!! Awareness and clear, deep understanding will put the people in the right lane for the race and the success in sustainable development !"
10598,"Or. Chuck is very knowledgeable and clearly passionate about ensuring that everybody know how to program. Further to this, the information that was provided in this course, along with the specialization's accompanying courses, gave me enough knowledge to begin my own venture into scraping, cleaning and storing web content. Add this to the University of Michigan's specialization in Data Science and you'll definitely have solid foundation knowledge of how to collect, manipulate and analyze digital data."
10599,Really good.
10600,"The course does not warrant the price, it has way too little information. Very dissatisfied."
10601,Excelente course! Thank you so much!
10602,The tutorials lack in depth explanation of methods work. His is not a university level course. its more like here is how to do it magically. There is no explanation on how the methods work. or how the method achieve what it does.
10603,The course was information.
10604,"His course has been very interesting, however I believe that the mix of gene has been somewhat limited. While I respect the artistic choice and talents of all artists, I feel that the discussions in the video for week 6 lack substance: picking up litter, photographic it, and arranging it for installation display strikes me as neither aesthetic nor documentary photography, unless the artist's message is in documenting our 'throw-away' society and highlighting the importance of 'recalling' for the benefit of the environment. Such messages did not appear to arise in my opinion. The discussion about architectural preservation was worthwhile but not focused. The interview(s) concerned could have assisted by asking relevant questions of the artist(s) for the benefit of an audience with varied photographic interests. By argument here does not involve the earlier weeks relating to the history of photography and the preservation of images for future generations which were excellent."
10605,Great Course
10606,"His is a great course with tons of valuable into. The peer-review projects are very hands-on, and you learn a lot by doing that. However, I wish there were more explanations for certain things (for example, for the experiments section) - or at least, more resources to get further into. Also, for Assignment 3, it would have been very helpful to have the answer key, since there is some confusion around some of the answers."
10607,Amazing teacher - must seen
10608,Very good and quick lessons on Data analysis.Managers should appreciate this course!
10609,Great course! His has been one of the best courses that I have taken at Coursera. I really liked the fact that we have a free book for the class and there are optional exercises for practicing what we have learned at the end of each week. The instructor knows the subject and is very clear.
10610,His is a very well thought course. It addresses everything you need to know when negotiating.It works whether you have negotiating experience or none at all.Thanks to the professor!
10611,"great course, with cool knowledge"
10612,His course introduces data science with a emphasis on large scale processing. The project was challenging and very interesting. Applying with I learnt throughout the specialisation to a real problem is very exciting.
10613,"Very well explained and not too fast. The quires were challenging but fair. I can totally recommend this course, because it gives you a good insight in macroeconomics and was not too theoretical.I also would like to thank Cousera for this great leaving opportunity."
10614,"To far this course has been great, the lecturer is awesome and the video are short enough to make you stay focused."
10615,"The course is fast-paced with 8-16 hours of workload for me (mostly for the assignment). The video are pretty clear, but because the concepts are pretty difficult I had to watch some of them many times. The learning is reinforced by weekly assignment. The solutions from peers became progressively better over the first half of the course, probably because of student attention. His course does require some hard work to follow. It help not just learn UNITY Of also it create concept for learner programme about C Sharp. it help how to efficiently use all features and functionality in game. I'm very happy i got my first ever experience with Michigan State University and really big thanks to Brian Inn Air, who provide nice lecture with energetic style. Thanks to Coursera to build unfordable and financial aid for all nations. i recommend to all."
10616,Timely for me and most enjoyable - made the learning easy
10617,A very interesting course and a good introduction to the topic. Would be beneficial if one could gain official credits or points towards an online degree with an expanded/more in-depth course volume.
10618,Course material is very dense and requires some background in baths/physics to understand it well. Would be better if it is extended to 5 - 6 weeks having more assignment.
10619,Clear and concise overview!
10620,A really awesome course for of enthusiast
10621,The assignment were very well made and the discussion forms were also very well moderate. I will highly recommend this to any of my peers who are interested.
10622,Excellent course for learning the key basis to being able to interact with web objects.
10623,"The course gives I think a good overview over the concepts of neutral network and the teaching material is good. However generally the course is more advanced than I suspected, so it took me much more time then what is given for the lectures / quires to complete it. Of you are not already familiar with the concepts and/or have a strong mathematical background it can be sometimes frustration :-)One thing that definitely needs improvement is that 2 times the questions of the quires were corrupted (parts were missing). Not sure if this was due to the material itself or a bug in the Cousera platform. To look in the discussion forum if you find something strange in the quires."
10624,"Buds to Jaffa for using charts and examples to provide a lot of insight without using a lot of path. However, I would personally like the path to be presented, too (e.g., the 'off-center' T-distribution, etc.). His could be done is special sections of the book and lectures, as is done in the Depression Models class."
10625,"Professor speaks too slowly most of the time but then quickly glasses over complicated equations without much explanation of what the equation is or what the variable are or laboring the equations (he has multiple equations on one slide when talking). Some video are 2 minutes, some are 11 minutes. Quizzes are exceedingly simple - 10 questions with only two possible answers each. 100% of the time, there is at least 1 question with the wrong answer. There have been no was to help answer questions or to rectify these wrong answers. All the while, Coursera keeps asking if I want to pay $45 to verify for this course. A!! You have to be joking. His class was disappointing. You'd almost be better off reading Wikipedia articles or a book."
10626,Very helpful
10627,It does open your mind and makes you think logical within the boundaries.
10628,"I am an inter school psychologist, and was concerned that the content of the specialization would not benefit me as a practitioner. I was going to just take this Possessing Achievement with the ELL in Mind and not the other courses. I am eternally grateful that I decided to take all three courses in the series. I have a better appreciation for both instructor and students. Such of the content and strategics benefit all earners, including myself. I would highly recommend this class, and the"
10629,I am really excited through taking such as a wonderful about my passion called Journalism
10630,"Considering the contents of the second and third course, this was too basic."
10631,Very well explained and the exercises are very cool.
10632,"I followed this course just for entertainment, along with with my normal academic courses (Energy and Nuclear Engineering) but it turned out to be very useful for my study efficiency and proficient. Very good!of: animation can be a little bit happy, but they are effective ;)"
10633,"The content is interesting but the professor is bad at securing (lack of structure, some rambling)."
10634,"Andrew G is one of the best teachers out there, he made it a point to really make concepts sound simple enough for a layperson to understand, very simple explanation of concepts is what kept me going. I really liked this course.The support forms and Him Other deserve a special mention - whenever I got stuck with my assignment I would look to the test scenario available to test my coming, it really helped me to complete the course especially with the assignment.I will not say that I am a master of machine learning now, but I am definitely more equipped and with experience I will get much better using the skill and technique that I learned in this course"
10635,Explains concepts very clearly. Anticipated and deals with possible stumbling blocks for students. Quite excellent.
10636,The majority of the lecture video were engaging and the structure provided you to move at your own speed.
10637,Excellent course. Would recommend it to anyone.
10638,"I like the podomoro strategy. It something I tried duringstudyinf for my last test. I get really distracted so I do other things other than homework but this helped me focus and want to focus so I can feel good about enjoying walking my dog, or checking my phone, or a longer break like watching Netflix."
10639,"Although the topics are great and very interesting, especially because I am a teacher who face many of the situations mentioned, the video are very hard to understand and I needed to put subscribe all the time."
10640,"Well organized course and enthusiastic lecturer. Of you have some basic experience with Atlas/Active and linear algebra, then the programming problems will be quite easy."
10641,"The course gives an insight into your brain and its powers and limitations. The best thing to do is to experiment the learning technique on this course itself. The tone of the course instructor is also very friendly. Nothing is difficult, if you try."
10642,"His course was very interesting and gave insight to the kind of material first year veterinary students would be learning plus history of the profession (mostly the school). The professors present actual anatomical (dissected) organs and histology sides. I also thought the husbandry section well done. The clinical portion is a little weak but understandable, given the medium and safety issues. I still enjoyed it. The history portion is a bit too in depth, I feel, and though interesting, spends a great deal of time on the history of the school and founder itself. They are very enthusiastic though, which is a plus. The course does a lovely job of presenting some of the various studies that go into this vigorous education/career, such as client interaction, anatomy, histology, animal husbandry, and examination skill. It is so much more than just a love for animals. I will certainly look into some of the other animal science-related MOOCs offered by Edinburgh. I had no difficulty in completing this course in one week although I do have a medical background."
10643,Great course. Professor Right really did great job to present Buddhist with modern psychology. Thanks a lot to the professor for the invaluable resources on this field.
10644,A methodological approach that provides both a global overview of Design Thinking and tools to solve real life scenario with it.
10645,In amazing course for people with a computer science background wishing to explore the world of human brain from of perspective.
10646,I think the whole process was very well composed and really enjoyed all the classes.
10647,"His seems like a good overview for those new to the kitchen, and/or health concerns more generally. For someone interested in deepening their understanding, it's of more limited value--but it is presented as an introduction. I wish there were reading to supplement the video."
10648,"I thought this was a wonderful way to explain the science of memory. Any Doctors are giving a dementia test as part of a yearly exam. You draw a clock and must put in the time mentioned plus three words. Frankly, I was annoyed as I was a former teacher, had to drive, park, and use a ticket machine to visit the doctor. I was even more annoyed when I asked him if he could give me a sent test and he asked me how I knew about such things. People in the eighties are very sensitive about their mental abilities.Thank you for a nice experience!Once Pier"
10649,A very nice course about leading organizations
10650,It was a good course - my only issue is that the quit material is out of order.
10651,A great insight into both functional programming as well as Scala by the man himself. On't be fooled though and don't take this course lightly as you have to put serious effort in it -- but you'll be rewarded accordingly.
10652,"Really nice course, not too difficult. The perfect first step into machine learning! Enjoyed it."
10653,very good !excellent experience !
10654,Very helpful for a new started
10655,Great information - well put together; logical organized; engaging
10656,"Thought provoking, were well orchestrated, I am learning, and I am moved, and I think we are all moved towards making the world a better place."
10657,"Not very much in depth and does not offer complete lecture notes, which are necessary for answering the quires..."
10658,Great Course. Assignment are the best part of the course.
10659,Perfectly well organised. Great Course
10660,It was really useful for me.
10661,Great course. Highly recommended.
10662,"Thanks Andrew sir and Coursera for offer this wonderful course,the course has now provided me the foundation needed in Machine Learning."
10663,Great course . It is really worth taking a shot.
10664,Thank you so much for this course! I really appreciate it!
10665,West Course Over. Brian Inn is very talented instructor. Thank you!
10666,Highly recommended!
10667,Easy to follow and understand for people without any experience in programming. I really enjoy it and I am definitely taking the whole specialization. Thank you.
10668,"Awesome course, good explanations. Spatial join does the magic! Great, loved it, kept me motivate."
10669,Absolutely Brilliant Course
10670,His course is fantastic.It reaches a great amount of started graphics design information but it is broken down into easily understood video and quires. The quality was top notch and the interaction was as good as you would get in a brick and mortar school.I did not feel like I was missing anything by taking it online.
10671,"(I posted this review in a blow [http://guhyasamajacenter.wordpress.com/2015/10/03/review-of-the-free-course-tibetan-buddhist-meditation-and-the-modern-world-lesser-vehicle-course-given-by-va/]. Such of the courseware was outstanding. Any of the video were so poorly done (boring) that I couldn't watch them. (I do not watch people read prepared text in a video. Over.)----------- From the blow ----------------------------------I recently took the FREE Coursera course, ""Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World"". (http://www.course.org/learn/buddhist-meditation) From the course catalogue: "" Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World explored the immense variety of meditation practices past and present. He present their histories, their philosophical underpinnings, their transformation in the modern global world, and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplation designed just for this course."" (Note: In the class overview, it is noted that the term ""Lesser Vehicle"" is ""perjorative"" but they use it anyway. ??"")There are many FREE reasons to take this FREE ""Lesser Vehicle"" course (the first of four):#1 - In awesome, wonderful hour-long interview with Charon Salzberg, one of the founders of the Insight Meditation Society. That an awesome lady. I was not aware that she is also a Dzogchen student. (Did I mention it was FREE?) North signing up for the course just to skin to Week 6 to watch this interview.#2 - Guided Meditations by Or. Anne Vein and Am Thubten. Very, very, very nice. FREE, it's ALL FREE.#3 - The Science of Sinfulness against the Background of the Scientific Study of Meditation video with Or. Clifford Baron, neuroscientist. His video start in Week 1 and continue through Week 6 in building a basis for understanding the scientific research on meditation. He (and the course) demonstrates what can and cannot (presently) be scientifically prove about meditation. One excellent example: Two trained pianists were told to learn a complicated piece of music, one with the piano, and the other only in his imagination. After 2 weeks (I think) of practice, their brains' MRI patterns exhibited almost the exact same changes. Or. Baron noted that the results are not definite but still may have implication for the compassion/bodhicitta meditations we do.#4: In interview on ""Buddhist Modernism"", with David McMahan. Very much academic-tormented. One statement, in particular, struck me since, the more I think about it, the more I think it might be true: ""The Buddhist Intra teachings are not accepted nor are they popular in the West."" For all the Buddhist monastics that visit the USA and the West to grab donations and go back to their home countries, few of them are sticking around to teach complete Intra classes. The few that do (and do it well) are having a hard time making ends meet. (That's just my opinion, I guess.)There are also short 5-10 minute interviews with Khenpo Tsultrim Odor (a short ""snapshot"" of the Tibetan take on the week's particular subject, which was often better (to me) than the min-long ""talking head"" version ) and Men. Tsoknyi Rinpoche (""Now does Buddhist change in a New Culture"" and ""Benefits and Dangers of Declaring Buddhist"", the of rebuttal, as it were. He did note that motivation is the key. Had agenda = bad results, good motivation will cause good results.)Have I noted the course is FREE? To you can take the course, and the following courses, without doing any of the assignment/quires. Watch (or download) any video or transcribe to your heart's content whenever you wish in any order you wish. (That assumes the courses are not taken off-line at a future date.) Further in the course description is a blurt that may point to at least 3 future courses in ""Mahāyāna, …Vajrayāna, …and a fourth vehicle, which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Most Intra”."" Of the quality of guided meditations (of) in following classes are even half the quality of this course's of's, then that's all the reason I need to continue the future classes, too.Course gotchas:#1. That said (other shoe dropping here), the other half of the course was video of people reading their prepared academic papers, in monotony or semi-monotony voices. (Transcripts are available. I figure I can read a paper in 5% of the time someone else reads it to me in a video. Ugh.) However, they would probably need the voice of Organ Freemen, James Karl Bones, B. Cumberbatch or James Paper to keep me awake. To be fair, the content is golden, although the papers seems to be feared to the academic community, rather than the student community. Looks and Sides on these subjects are all over Amazon, YouTube, FPMT, Harm-Documentaries, etc.#2. The Charon Salzberg (of), in her interview, brought up an excellent point. The noted that she and a noted clinical psychology (of) scientist (researcher) (whose name I have forgotten) were at a conference where the issue on the table was that someone was having trouble with ""loving kindness"" meditation as a first meditation class. of noted that she would instantly recommend the student change to ""calm abiding"" meditation whereas the of could not change that student's meditation technique to another technique (such as calm abiding) as her research findings would then be invalid. Similarly, many of the non-Buddhist guided meditations that I viewed in this course felt like a physical education or ""Now To"" class. To this. To that. It did not feel as though they lived the material, just taught it. (Whereas it was patiently obvious Or. Vein & Am Thubten were definitely ""walking the walk"", so to speak, so were able to speak from the heart.)Interviews I did not watch, that may be of great interest to others, include meditation in the school system by Wish Jennings, meditation in the Business Community (an interview with David Sick), the Surmise meditation tradition in an interview with Risk Traun, the MBSR (Meditation Based Stress Reduction) with Susan Later-U, and meditation in the legal community with Rhonda Age.And all that is just the first course. Any of it's ""failing"" may just be my kari opinions. The course is worth checking out and watching/reading/meditating on those parts that interest you. In that respect, the breadth of the course content is quite nice and so well done. Trade: B-."
10672,"Vice, information, but basic and short."
10673,I've learnt from this course. It's very useful for me.
10674,"His course has taken me from being a layman, knowing little more than what popular science magazines could tell me, to understanding how these systems work and how to create my own. I understand that a lot has changed during the five years since this course was made, but I believe this will form a solid foundation upon which to build upon. By intention now is to take this knowledge and apply it to experiment with and create new applications."
10675,"Tremendous amount of information. Instructor often says ""this will become less mathematical from now on!"" when in fact it doesn't. Exact literature references are missing for later chapters. Still very useful material."
10676,"The course itself is fine. The quires, however, are so frustration as to lower the enjoyment of the whole thing. Numerous answers are just actually wrong. You end up taking the quit time and again and then selecting random answers just to pass."
10677,"Covers basic statistics (Mean, Variance, Simple Z and T tests). Not what I was expecting as Inference. Multiple testing of data is a sign of poor experimental design and should be avoided, not adjusted for. Bootstrapping is not a new idea and has been used in other fields."
10678,The course overall has good content. But some video and case studies were disappointing in terms of uniqueness of information. You could have easily growled it. Rests could also be more challenging. I would defitenely recommend it to earners who are new to the industry. For others it could be less information.
10679,His course is not just another online course. You enjoy doing it and will learn a lot. To for it
10680,very information
10681,I learned a lot about how dogs and people think. The experiment video Or. Are shows are really interesting!
10682,"wonderful course, systematically cover the flow chart of the O&D industrial, with analysis of details !!!! basically the course make me procure a whole picture of this industrial and specific rules underlying in it.But the it maybe dull a little bit if you are not interested in this topic."
10683,"Andrew is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Externally smart and articulated, but also super thoughtful and humble to explain the easiest things assuming we might not know. Assignment were challenging, but forms and senators were totally worth it. His was a very hard class for me (non technical background), but the best online class that made me engaged all the way to the end."
10684,"Really solid course content, lucid taught by Professor Andrew, at a pace neither too fast nor too slow. Not to learn a lot about octavo, vector mathematics and a bunch of other stuffs apart from machine learning, which I may add, seemed quite real world and logical sound, in spite of being quite advanced both in terms of the engineering and mathematics involved. I can thank Professor Andrew only so much, but I must also add that the amount of materials available in the Resources and Discussion Forum, also helps this course to be one of the most enjoyable one that I have taken till date.Is - Thanks to this course I know how exactly Coursera will process my Review and what exactly it will do with it.

10697,"A comprehensive and fascinating introduction to astrobiology. The course is delivered by an excellent team and offers valuable insight into the cutting-edge field.I would just like to mention to anyone thinking of taking this course that while it is indeed watered to beginners, there are some sections in which it would be helpful to have a basic understanding of cell biology (ultrastructure in particular) as technical terminology is used and could potentially be overwhelming without some prior knowledge.However this only applies to a small part of the course and the rest is very much accessible. Highly recommended."
10698,Great course and content delivery was outstanding
10699,"I had forgotten how much reading there is! I didn't have a lot of time, but I enjoyed the lectures a lot and it visited my interest in history and ancient civilization. I think I learned more from this than the Ancient Iv class I took many years ago in college! Most enjoyable!"

10704,"The course was useful in providing an introduction to the basis of game theory.However it would benefit from a native English proofread and smoother delivery.There were also problems throughout regarding the display of graphics and notes behind the professor, who kept pointing to something other than he was referring to.A couple of path nations were also incorrect, for example ""<"" when the professor said ""less than or equal to"".Overall though, I'm pleased that I took the course and I learned several important aspects of the topic that will benefit me in future study."
10705,Great course! Content very organized and its 'hands-on' format is really challenging. It helped me a lot.
10706,"Actually, I am quite disappointed by this course. The language is so slow that it is terribly difficult to make sense of each sentence.The content barely scratches the surface and there is neither a forum, nor an exchange with other earners. I miss interactivity and I am glad that I decided to review the course and not pay for it as it definitely is not worth the money."
10707,"I really enjoyed this course. It is the perfect choice for someone who would like to further deepen the knowledge of the subject. Moreover, although the lessons are registered and are not live-streaming, it still has been a privilege to hear what happened during the crisis from the lips of one of the major political Actors of that period."
10708,Good basic course
10709,His projects in this course tested all the knowledge that i had acquired before. The projects were challenging enough and well prepared.

10717,His is very basic and fundamental.
10718,"this course is very useful if you want to learn about something that majority of people(not including me) don't care about, and is based on out-dated into and opinions of a high middle class, house mon. this course is a waste of data. someone get some actual statistics here."
10719,Programming exercises are really hard and you don't find much help
10720,very useful my life

I am so grateful to have had access to this vast sea of knowledge presented! Some of the lectures are a bit long and are not accompanied by PowerPoints, illustrations, or eyford pop-out, but if you apply your meditative focus, you will be grace with an immense amount of information on the topic. There are also practices (with into and conclusions) presented by three different teachers each week. You can really tell a lot of thought, effort, and love went into this program design. The inclusion of Or. Baron was just a delight as well - I am inspired to continue in my research and my practices related to this course. Thank you to everyone involved in making this happen!"
10735,Great into course....Would you consider more courses?
10736,great course
10737,Perfect to start patron programming and follow!

10747,"I like the design of the class, very clear and easy to understand!"
10748,His was a fantastic Course
10749,"Instructor seems uninterested or bored. Sometimes he only reads the sides without adding anything else to the content. Others, he goes quickly through a slide without any time to digest the information. Overall, into level concepts are ok, but specific about creation or handling of tools is left without deeper explanation"
10750,Great course with good information.
10751,"very practical, professional course"
10752,Very good content. Challenging assignment that force you to learn more yourself rather than just apply what you've heard and forget it in 10 minutes.
10753,"Unfortunately, the material and lectures of this course fell short of my expectations. Lectures don't follow a logical path and are all over the place, and some concepts are not expanded as required. Overall, I believe they need to improve how the content is presented, and how it's applied in a real world context."
10754,"I think the course is very good, but the peer review trading should be improved! Sometime, people have to wait for more than 3 weeks to get their assignment grade, or they don't know whether they will get the grade. Thanks!"
10755,"it's the best course of machine learning i'have token in my life,the method of teaching is great, the content is really fantastic, the instructor teaching skill is excellent and it cover lots of real world artificial applications so it's very amazing"

10768,Very interactive. I can speak now.
10769,nicely done guns!
10770,"Glasses moved very fast, especially in the video materials. Functions were introduced briefly without time to digest. While I ultimately did learn the topics through my own research, I feel the class would have been much more beneficial with slower, more depth explanations."
10771,"His course was enjoyable and challenging. Early lessons cover historical withers, along with some fun programming challenges to attack them.Later lessons dive into modern cryptography. His is more challenging and you will need to study some number theory if you have not done so previously. I ended up buying Prof At' book and also Concrete Mathematics to fully get my head around the subject matter. The treatment is not superficial.His is where I dropped one star from the review - I thought that the course could have done a better job of covering the theory in this space, or at least pointing to sources to study it, or mentioning it as a pre-requisite.I also thought that the course could have done a better job of describing how all the pieces come together - the discussion is there, but it is light and somewhat assumed you will get it. The only thorough discussion is specifically for SSL / TLS late in the lecture series.Overall, a good and challenging course. His is not an easy MOOC - so only take it if you are interested in a challenge and don't mind extra study time."
10772,Not enough Tableaux use for it to be in the title of the course
10773,"It is a great course, simple, direct and very useful"
10774,It was very nice. Thank you!
10775,"awesome lectures by Or.Chuck , i really enjoyed them and i got much clarity on them.thank u sir"
10776,I thought this was really helpful for my day to day career as a developer. It helped give me better tools to talk about what I am working on as well as introducing me to some new concepts.
10777,The course was really helpful especially as it started off by building the basic understanding of accounting to more complex things. Is an engineer with absolutely no background of accounting it was very beneficial for me as I begin my MBA journey. After 1 month in the MBA I feel that the pre-course was indeed the best way to get my foundations right to get the most out of the classes in the school.
10778,Extremely helpful and effective!
10779,I think sometimes it got very confusing some of the examples being the exact same from chapter to chapter. It was nice having a ground for it but i started to question why would you use this method instead of the one we used before for hours and rate specifically.
10780,"Professor Each's discussion, as well as the course materials, were sufficiently encompassing and thoroughly researches. The course presented a good overview of the climate change problem as well as how humanity can overcome these obstacles through sustainable development."
10781,"It was a great experience to discover the basis in Financial, now I have a wide view in general of how it works the Financial Markets."
10782,"Very information class, I highly recommend any one who is interested in machine learning, and is interested in knowing how it really works should take this class.

10787,"I love the well-designer questions that evaluate my understanding of the topic. and the explanation feedback is good, too."
10788,"I used to always say that everyone in life no matter what their profession was, should take at least one basic psychology course in their lives. After taking this course I can now say that this course is another one on the list for everyone in life to take --it should be a requirement. I feel very fortunate to have stumbled upon it, and I´m very happy that I took it! And just by taking the course my life has already started to change, because I am now aware of things to make myself happier that I was not aware of before, so this course has shed a lot of light on life, human beings and how to be happier. Last, I´m very grateful to Prof. Rajagopal Raghunathan, for coming up with the great idea of giving this course! And wish him all the best with his new book! Thank you all!"
10789,His course delivered exactly what was promised in an engaging way.
10790,Good overview. Wish there were more take away documents as well as links to additional information that summarized content in each section so you had a course book with terms at the end.

10833,Very interesting and a very good starting point for people who want to know to manage projects
10834,"His Course is a total scar. In doubt? Sign up for the free version and go watch the video. Each video is only 1-2 minutes long, so you can watch all 7 weeks in half an hour ( speed 1.5). O, I forgot they also include a link to a 4 years old TED talk, in but not really relevant.His course is a disgrace to Coursera. It ought to be removed."

10839,"Excellent course! I learned a lot and Andrew G is a really good ""online teacher""! Highly recommended!"
10840,"Great course, I really liked it. I found it very education and enjoyed the interviews of the children most of all.I feel the class would benefit by discussing how gender roles are formed in society, why are evasive through many aspects of society, how they are historically evolved, comparison in more aspects with the societies mentioned that are more open to gender fluidity etc. That would help us understand whether there is a necessity behind the gender roles or whether it is a natural step to drop them altogether, how they apply to other gender defined groups etc. I see why this would give the class a more society critical and perhaps political dimension however."
10841,The course has given me a better understanding of the Diplomacy.
10842,Exceptionally very good course - Must for anyone who is doing research on Control systems using game theory !!! Buds to all the three professors !!! Will definitely do Same Theory 2 !!!

10849,Great
10850,"His course is indicated to anyone looking for an overview of Python programming. All Assignment and Quizzes are quite simple problems. To be honest, I expected more of this course."

10852,"very good considering the amount of information conveyed in the short amount of time. A few of the tests were slightly itchy in the acceptable range of correct answers (in terms of rounding answers) and would only accept things like 17*sort(15426) as the answer, even if an equivalent value down to the th denial place was give instead."
10853,Very useful and well explained.

10884,Amazing course !
10885,"very good learnt a lot but , a small suggestion is that please work out even more problems it helps us strengthen concepts . Thank you"
10886,"I think that this course has wonderful material, however, I think that more than 2 people should be required to peer review the assignment so it is a balanced grade. In my other classes, at least 5 reviews are required to review each individual assignment."
10887,Great course. Good instructor. Everything is explained in an easy-to-understand manner.
10888,"It is very interesting! I was really satisfied by this course and teacher. But I think, Drew sometimes pay too much attention for simple details and don't pay enough attention for more complex ones, but it was only few times. In general I'm really glad to study and to finish. Wish you guns all the best!"
10889,A must course for anyone interested in Machine Learning.
10890,Great course!
10891,It is very good beginning for of.
10892,I still think that there is a lot to learn. the fact that I have limited time to complete the tasks made me hurry and not dig deeper into things I would like to.Of I could use the forum and ask questions after the course ended it would be better.generally the course is very good for beginners. The instructor is very good and encouraged me to continue learning.

10925,Love it! I have taken several MOOCs and this is definitely in my top 5! The video are great! and Or. Have Dixon is the be
10926,The best course and insight based on research based evidence. Love it.
10927,"His course is very helpful for me now. After finished this course, It is good to think about how to study, how to commit with others in my life, and how to try to avoid negative feedback in future：）"
10928,Fabulous course and such an happiness inspiring teacher Or A is!!! I truly recommend this midst changing and life changing course.
10929,A Systematic and methodical course to learn about Project Management Principles and Practices. It is not only exhaustive and structures but also practical and useful. Any Thanks to the course facilitate and the team.
10930,It's a very nice course but it is very small.
10931,"A great course, with a good proclamation. I think that it was really important for my career."
10932,Great useful course
10933,"By far one of the best courses I've been on! Well structures, engaging and interesting! I really enjoyed this!"
10934,"Mathematically intense, would like to repeat the course to understand the material even better. It has made me worthy of reading the research papers in this area... Thanks for this great course."
10935,the teacher is great! WOW
10936,His course is a great introduction to web programming using patron.
10937,Really Vice....
10938,"From this course, i have learned Earth system science is the study has more scientific data steaming from various fields of research, such as the atmosphere, ocean, land ice and others, fit together to form the current picture of our planet as a whole, including its changing climate.Thank you Professor's."
10939,"His is a great course for anyone looking to take their knowledge of basic web design to a new level. I found bootstrap a little intimidating at first but this course does a great job of teaching and explaining it at a great pace. Of you're new to web development and tired of making webster that look like they're from the was, bootstrap is a great tool to get your webster to look modern and professional. The instructor is very knowledgeable and explains things thoroughly (he's also very funny!). I recommend incorporating the additional learning materials as they will help you understand the concepts discussed in the lectures on a much deeper level. Lastly, be sure to do every exercise as they are essential to completing the assignment. Have fun!"
10940,Excellent and challenging course for someone like me with no musical background or knowledge.
10941,Great
10942,"A good follow- up to the previous course. The material is well organised and gives a profound overview while still inciting further investigation, leaving enough room for expansion of the mind and new thoughts on... almost everything."
10943,"I really liked this course. It was concrete and well prepared and interesting, easy to archive. I had an experience in similar training classes, so I consider that is really useful to repeat or learn, if you a new in this topic. For me, is the must that the professor(s) was good in public speaking, other way I will feel boring.I would like to suggest this course to others.Mind regards,Kateryna."
10944,"His course is very useful for learning machine learning , i appreciate for taking this class by Coursera , and i would be grateful to Andrew of !"
10945,The course offers practical suggestions on time management and productivity. It has helped me to focus on work and meet my professional goals.
10946,Wonderful and interesting course. Thanks!
10947,Great course!
10948,Great course
10949,"The lectures from week 1 to week 3 are nice and useful to me, but I think there should be more details about the content in week 4. For example, I think the lecture about the Jeffreys prior skipped many things and I did not understand this concept very well."
10950,Excellent break down of Angular of. A very good introduction; you will still need to read the Angular of docs to get depth.
10951,"Or. Chuck is so skilled at teaching. His teaching style and presentations are easy to follow. The class is not as challenging as other Python courses, but it's a great step to learning Python well."
10952,His course helped me a lot to learn about coming based on different brothers etc. HTML5 is required for any front-end based jobs.
10953,The lesson is information but the course professor does not share value on each slide. The's reading each point and does not provide additional insight.
10954,"Very good, clear and concise course. By favorite so far"
10955,Really enjoyed this course. It was relevant and showed some new landscape that I could use in my career.
10956,Material 5/Instructor 5/There is none better than Or Chuck and University of Michigan for learning patron on-line.
10957,His give a very good insight into what i did not know earlier. Thank you Prof. Under Old. I recommend this course to all all. I did a lot of learning. To for it
10958,I find Charles' lectures very easy to follow and they impart understanding very effectively.
10959,"Very thorough and engaging. Optional material allowed the more curious to learn a great deal about the topics. Simple, hands-on approach to classification algorithms. Highly recommended!"
10960,Very good course. I wish we could have done more algorithms with the map. Such a great way to teach algorithms.
10961,Good Course to understand basis of Same designing
10962,His is a brilliant course to learn statistics from scratch. The instructor are too good and their teaching methods and examples are very lucid. A must visit course for everyone who wants to get their statistics correct
10963,Great introductory to Python!
10964,His was a good course and quite challenging. It requires a lot of self learning if you are not familiar with hands. I wish some of the mechanics that were required to solve the assignment were better explained in the course material.
10965,I am in the middle of it.I find it a bit challenging but very interesting.
10966,"I am very happy to study the course learn how to learn I am very grateful to those who have set up this course interesting I offer a big thanks from my heart for every team that took the preparation, presentation and follow-up and extend my thanks to the site and management course."
10967,I enjoyed this course very much. I rate 4/5 because I would liked a broader explanation on how to translate Stock and Low Skiagrams to mathematical models.
10968,Its a very good course for those interested in Image Processing. The professor has a wide knowledge in this field and one will learn more after going through the recommended books. You will also learn a bit of MATLAB for Image processing in this course.
10969,I LOVED these instructor! I wish I could take an entire year of classes with them. I felt like they really want the students to succeed. Great course for learning the basis of writing for young readers. They gave us plenty to think about and wetted my desire to write even more! Thanks so much!
10970,"I love the main lecture of the statistics. The Subject is fun. After couple lecture, my mind was very clear.But most of the time I'm working on the statistics software name R. I think it would be better if require R knowledge. Of not, student like me will need more than weeks to get use to R. I don't mean learn another software is bad idea. I will always like to learn something new. That's why I go MOOC. That I mean is R and Basic Statistics should be separated. First R, than Basic Statistics. Or first Basic Statistics than R.I really enjoy the class. but the extra is a bit heavy for me."
10971,i recommend this is a good course for machine learning .......... :D
10972,BEST COURSE FOR ANALYTICS PERSON.
10973,"very nice, I learned a lot, THANK YOU!"
10974,Or A is the most happy man I have ever met! Very helpful course with many positive information to enhance our happiness!
10975,comprehensive overall view to the management topics
10976,"Excellent course, you get amazing information and valuable guideline for free!"
10977,"one of the best courses you may take to develop your business ,,,"
10978,"Excellent course, very practical with challenging exercises. The tools and knowledge leaned are of great use for solving hard problems. Special thanks for the team that made this online class available."
10979,EXCELLENT! Any Any Good wishes!!! Simply wonderful & glad to learn from Or. Have Dixon!
10980,"Short and crisp course. I learnt to differentiate between acute bacterial and vital rhinosinusitis. I now appreciate that the basic pathology in chronic rhinosinusitis is inflammatory and therefore the appropriate treatment includes topical steroids and hypertonus saline irrigation. Being a family physician from a developing country, this succinct information would help me to manage my patients better."
10981,"A decent course, perhaps not as interesting as the previous one. But definitely very innovative and information"
10982,"Really a great course. I have learned a lot during this course. It was well explained, the teachers were dynamic and interesting. I believe everyone should take the 2 weeks this course requires in order to become a better learner."
10983,"The syllabus is adequate, suitable for introducing digital marketing.Sides are all right, with a good selection of interview professional. Transcripts are very useful to have under the video, however, there are mistyped and mislead words here and there. It is useful to see the time needed for each task (video, reading, exercise), though it is nearly always underestimated (even the video).Examples chosen for exercises are interesting and motivation. I like this active way of learning."
10984,"A great course, a must for those in the machine learning domain."
10985,The best course of machine learning I had ever taken.
10986,"The course does an of (but not great) job at teaching Data Structures. And it does an of (but not great) job at teaching Algorithm Performance/Optimization.The lectures and started code could use some better integration.The assignment could be improved. They give you a bunch of code and ask you to complete it. His is kind the way things work when you inherit a bunch of code, but its not how it works if you have to write it from scratch.His course has been taught many times, and the forms contained old posts, and they didn't seem as useful as in other courses I've taken.By main objective for this course was to continue learning Cava, and it helped me do that, so I gave it 3 Stars."
10987,"Outside my field, but useful course. Any thanks for setting out the unfathomable."
10988,Excellent course. It helped a lot and brought
10989,short but good introduction
10990,His course was great. Very inspiration and I felt like I learned clot!!!
10991,Excellent introduction to Python!
10992,great course! Run and interesting
10993,"Excellent course, Rogers enthusiasm shows truly through to his speed-talk :-)"
10994,very helpful instruction
10995,"Enjoyed the class, only part that was bad is I couldn't do any of the quires. I can't afford the cost. Other then that the class was very information and I found it very entertaining as well. Thank you."
10996,"Thank you very much to Andrew and to the whole team for the great course!All the best, a lot of fun during your next trips into education, research!Merry Christmas and Happy New Dear!"
10997,"Very mixed feelings about this course.Generally speaking, the course lectures are information and well organized. Senators are really of great help, they are doing a great job, honestly: they are very active, they give good insight, they know the subject matter.But in the course lectures, there are occasions where concepts are used which were not formally introduced before their actual use.One example: in the lectures on probability, the first ""slide"" in the lecture talks about random processes, outcome of random process,... In the next slide, the notion of probability of an event is introduced, but the very notion of ""event"" was never introduced. It is introduced in the accompanying book, but if it is the case that the book chapters should be read PRIOR to watching the course video, that fact should be made clear.Further in the course on probability, some words are used ""interchangeable"" without the context making it clear why they can be used interchangeable. For instance, on some occasions, the concept of independent events is used, but then, later on, the discussion talks of independent processes. Which is which??? Is there a difference? Of so, what is it? When do I need to use independent events as opposed to independent processes?The grade assignment are of varying quality. The most disturbing thing about them is that, on some occasions, concepts are used in the quit questions (either directly in the questions and answer choice, or indirectly in the ""correction"" for the quit after you have submitted it) that were never touched upon in the course.I have had two occasions of concepts not introduced in the course but used in the grade assignment.The first occurrence of a gap between course content and quit questions was on a quit question about inference. I failed the question, and understood why I failed based on the course content literally minutes after failing the question (and one enter actually rightly corrected me). But the question ""correction"" (the explanation text you receive after submitting, as justification for what the correct answer is) referred to the concept of ""two-sided hypothesis test"". There did THAT come from?? I checked and checked the course video, no mention at all of it. I checked the accompanying book, and the first mention of two-sided hypothesis test is way way way further in the book, in a chapter that is entirely rousing on inference.The second occurrence was in week 4. The course lectures cover two distribution: normal and binomial. The recommended reading in the book also focus on these two distribution (the recommended reading actually ships the section on geometric distribution, if I remember well). But in one of the quit question, there was one of the possible answers referring to the geometric distribution. Of it is the case that we are supposed to know and understand about geometric distribution, then the course content should cover the subject. Or at the very least, the course lecture should mention clearly that earners are advised to read about it in the accompanying book.The guideline for the project assignment (week 5) are not all that clear as to what is expected from the earners. Sure, there are instructions on where to find the into, what structure should be followed,... There is also a very nice ""example"" project (designed by one of the senators), which provides a lot of useful into (how to filter missing values from variable,...).But there is no real hint as to the depth of analysis we are expected to complete. His is definitely a source of confusion, not only for me, but also for a few other earners, from what I gathered in the discussion forms. The result is that the projects you get to review are of very disparage levels. Some end up in calculating one figure per research question, without any attempt at deriving tends or patterns, others do not include any plots at all,... The thing is that the peer review criterion do not really provide a good basis to ensure that earners did indeed assimilate the course contents. Most of the questions in the peer review assignment have a lot more to do with following a canvas and not so much with the course substance itself.For instance, some of the peer review criterion have to do with the narratives for computer statistics and plots. The criterion are: ""Is each plot/R output followed by a narrative"", ""Does the narrative correctly interpret the plots, or statistics"", ""Does the narrative address the research question"". But when the research question is a question of the type ""That it the IQR for income per state"", for instance, the narrative can be very short: ""IQR per state shows that the state with higher amiability of income is..."". To, the narrative meets the 3 evaluation criterion: there is a narrative, it does address the research question, and it does correctly interpret the statistics. But it is not particularly useful.I do understand that Internet-based peer review is challenging, and that you have to settle for ""neutral"" criterion that are easy to assess by earners. But the peer review trading ""grid"" as it currently stands is not ""that"" helpful in possessing whether the course contents has been assimilated.To conclude, when I took the course, my initial plan was to follow the entire specialization. But after having completed the first course of the specialization, I have radically changed my mind, and will look for alternatives ""elsewhere"" to get the knowledge/skilled that I am after."
10998,"His is an excellent course for EVERYBODY, no matter where you are in your programming track. Of you have not programme, this is a great starting point. Of you have been programming for years, it help to relate to those that haven't."
10999,Great Learning Experience. Clear lectures and beneficial. Looking forward to the next session.
11000,Very information. I like the additional resources offered for further learning.
11001,"great explanations, a lot of unable information in every module, and plain language to make even convoluted items seem easily within grasp. I'm grateful I was able to take this course"
11002,Excellent course! All material clearly explained and interesting and useful programming exercises. Thank you!
11003,The course is fascinating. Abundance of examples and cases studies makes it stand out. Definitely lots of insight and fresh thoughts on a topic.
11004,"Widespread precise in-formation, giving strength to go ahead"
11005,the course was interesting and really easy to learn. I would recommend it to beginners who wish to start learning web design
11006,"Very well scraped course suitable for working executive. The assignment are designed in a way, which ensures that only studious and diligent students only can get through.The capstone project demands thorough understanding of the course and its contents."
11007,Great course. Not more deeper into rails and got more fun.
11008,His course helped me to solve some questions i had about nutrition. It also helped me with lots of technique to include vegetables and healthy food at home. By 9 years old boy tested a cucumber yesterday with salad dressing! i couldn't believe that was possible. It's easy to follow and encouraging. Thank you.of. from Venezuela.
11009,"Thanks a lot Coursera staff and Professor Charles Severance!!! Great job!!! The course is help me a lot. Python is my first programming language. I started my bachelor degree in Information Systems at UFPE (Universidade Federal de Pernambuco) from Brazil, and our first discipline about programming was with Python."
11010,A very fruitful effort and a nice MOOC by Iv of London allowing many many people/researches across the globe to learn about state of art research methods which are usually not taught at phil or the levels.
11011,Really TOP Course! It is really useful even for an already Saw graduate who wants an introduction to the American Saw.
11012,"Short, nice and exactly to the point. Great exercises and excellent delivery."
11013,His course is super useful and provides clear explanation. Strongly suggest
11014,Easy to understand. The lectures given by the instructor are very information especially for a layman.
11015,Really easy to understand and the best place to start to learn machine learning!
11016,A lot of useful technique and motivation.
11017,very information.
11018,Very useful course that will save you a lot of pain in your project management journey.
11019,I really like it!!! It was a very helpful course.
11020,Thanks
11021,"Scholarship for further nodules, please."
11022,His is a great course.
11023,All theory. Quizzes you were left with the task of answering questions based on models never seen or explained spent most time trying to make sense of them. Final project is almost a joke to try and decipher how to create from scratch based on the ones they provided in the quires. Its not a joke but it is very difficult when the actual expel and model making isn part of the lectures.
11024,Very useful course
11025,"Really great professor and material! I found the content to be relevant and the tools to be practical and useful. Also, the course fit into my busy life (i.e. there aren't hours and hours of lectures to watch), yet I still got a lot out of every week! Prof. Bilimoria has a great presentation style and very encouraging/accessible approach."
11026,"His course proved to be a waste of time. There was nothing about the structure and forms of the strong quarter, just ""here's a good one to listen to."" Almost complete devoid of intellectual content."
11027,Great class for students with some elementary programming background who are eager to learn the fundamentals of algorithm design.
11028,"very information course, great syllabus, enjoyed watching the video and learned a great deal."
11029,"His course has been deeply information. The instructor is outstanding, sharing his deep experience and knowledge of economics, geography, international development, and earth science through the lectures. The time commitment required for this course is minimal considering the immense treasure of learning it represents. By only issues with this course (hence 4 stars instead of 5) are: 1. no one is monitoring the course, so questions/comments are only answered by other students; and 2. there is no certificate. Thank you Coursera and Or. Each for this fantastic course!"
11030,its a nice introduction a had easy
11031,Great course ! Highly recommend .
11032,"great, lots of useful practice assignment with detailed explanations."
11033,Excellent get hands on programming with MATLAB. It really provide real world insight when it comes to amputations used in engineering and science.
11034,"brain washing project, nice"
11035,Very good to learn the skill for machine learning beginners
11036,In excellent course that expands on previously known topics in life sciences.
11037,"Wish to have more systematic structure, detail information and hands-on exercises."
11038,"It was a very knowledgeable course. Please start a course on ""Perovskite Solar cells"" as well if you can."
11039,I learned a lot about nutrition not only for me but for children. I work with children and it is nice to be able to give insight on nut
11040,"I love this course, I am new to course and have a passion for psychology and have gained lots of useful knowledge from this. 10/10 i recommend."
11041,"Excellent course, it was sure difficult at the beginning but be patient, at the end you will be amazed of the amount of game design skill you've learned! Thanks a lot professor O'Cornell!"
11042,Andrew G is really good both at searching and teaching.
11043,"In excellent course in machine learning that goes beyond mere training algorithms and discusses other significant practical machine learning problems such as feature extraction and selection. The course also touches upon project management, resource allocation and decision making in the real-life of projects."
11044,"Course was amazing. It deals with how to correctly understand visual allusions through empirical data collection. It does not delve into the anatomical aspects, or the cellular aspects, of vision. Some drawback would be the lack of explanation on how to model or collect the data, which is probably too complicated to state in a online course anyway."
11045,The class was very helpful to me. The information learned definitely improved my improvisations style. It was presented very clearly by the instructor. The assignment were interesting and helpful. I have recommended the class to a friend who is taking it at the moment:) Will recommend it to others!!!
11046,Wonderful and instructive course!
11047,"excellent course. I learn a lot, very complete and recommended"
11048,"His is a very good beginner course that requires the student to practice, practice, practice. Of the student does the work, then the lectures, and quires will support them in a substantial way. The quit is well designed to measure what the student learned in that module. There were some audit issues in the beginning where the audit was wrong, but if you studied hard, you can still choose the correct answer.His is not a course that can be casually studied, in order to do well, practice is necessary. I appreciate this course and look forward to the next level."
11049,It's awesome for launching yourself in the world of Machine Learning.
11050,Perfect!
11051,I didn't learn many data science concepts in this class
11052,great class. Challenging but worth it.
11053,its a very good course
11054,His course has given me a basic knowledge of different tools and statistical technique that data scientist use to play with data.
11055,"I love this course, is very well organized and easy to follow."
11056,Very interesting way to learn very important topics in order to develop photographic skill.
11057,Great Discussions from Managing Data Analysis
11058,"I liked the way that the professors insisted on understanding the mechanics behind the concepts learned, using the memory models and asking for that pen and paper for drawing them.I didn't find any pus with course notes containing the concepts discussed in a written form but I think I'll listen some of the video and write that notes for myself.I managed to understand quite a few object tormented concepts that were flurry for me before, thank you for that. Now, it's practice time, to avoid forgetting all that !"
11059,great starting point
11060,Great course!
11061,"Excellent course. Content, teachers, structure, everything is excellent. Highly recommend this course for experts and new teachers."
11062,Amazing course!
11063,"Great course. Although it is not so new, the content is still up to date and applicable in real of problems."
11064,The course is taught pretty nice and and clean. I definitely learned a lot.
11065,It is a very good Introduction for those of Is that know nothing of Linguistic. I was very happy to take it.
11066,Great Course.
11067,"In this course, Bandy Lava does a deeper dive into the importance of social media monitoring and gives a nice overview of some key social listening tools available on the market today."
11068,The gap between the lecture materials and programming assignment is enormous. To much of lecture seem to be on the history and theoretical of R programming that it completely fails to cover the material needed to actually completed the programming assignment. Incredibly disappointing!
11069,Really helpful in learning.
11070,Thought provoking. Killed with excellent tools and technique.
11071,Great course
11072,Excellent overview of the topic and explanation of important aspects.
11073,very good introduction for microbime in gut
11074,Its easy to learn with the video and making all the code practices.its a very good course. I didn't know patron at all and at the end I can make good patron programs.
11075,The course was to basic for me but it filled up some of my basic knowledge gaps.
11076,A great course to enhance one's curiosity in the art of modern poetry!
11077,Well align with the skill required to teach a second language!
11078,His course is really cool because you learn some essential tips for learning to learn.The rest is up to you
11079,Moved it.
11080,"It is as stated: Programming for Everybody (who hasn had any exposure to programming). Of you dont know about computers and you dont know about programming, this course is for you.In the other hand: if you do have a basic understanding of computers and/or programming, than this may no be the right course for you: The beginning is too slow - the stuff about CPUs & memory etc. is really for people who dont know about computers at all. The overall pace is too slow.By suggestion would be to) shorten the introduction part) increase turning-curve & depth) add more complex assignment -> maybe as ""bonus assignment"""
11081,"The course has been very information, the mystery cases we had to solve challenging.The topic and how the team approached it was great, but there have been some downsides too. The transcripts were full of mistakes as done with a voice recognition software and obviously not double checked (which is bad for non-native speakers like me), and some of the material given in the mystery cases would have needed some further explanation on how to interpret them. Especially for the ones without any previous knowledge - like me - there should be more information or a help desk. Beer review is another issue. I am still not quite sure what I have done wrong, as there was no feedback. And, sometimes I really didn't know how to give feedback myself, as I didn't know if I was right or wrong with my analysis. Of relying on peer review only, there should be solutions handed in after you have submitted so that you can learn from your mistakes and are able to review the others correctly.All in all I have learned loads within these 5 weeks and I will definitely come back on another course. It has been fun and challenging!"
11082,"I am finding this course very useful for me. Some places I lack using some correct verbs and sometimes not seeing parallel structure of the sentence, this course is helping me identifying those areas which are needed to be corrected."
11083,"A good introduction to cava programming, the enter team was really helpful and interactive and it was a pleasure to interact with them!Unfortunately, it is clear that this course still needs to be polished: some assignment contained mistakes or where even begged. Mistakes and bags have been fixed when they were reported but it still left an ""amateur"" aftertaste (especially considering that we had to wait for a few weeks for this course)."
11084,The classes were great - very information. The discussion forms was my favorite - I was able to get live help on the he assignment from classmates and senators. Thank you for a great learning experience!
11085,Great to kickstart your R programming skill.A bit basic sometimes and exercises are not very advanced.
11086,"Awesome however was a little difficult to follow, I think it can be better by a step by step practices..."
11087,Learning Now to Learn changed my world. I can't believe I got to learn this from this gem of a class for free. Unbelievable.
11088,Good course!
11089,Would be great to see more detailed mathematical explanation.
11090,Interesting and challenging course! Thank You!
11091,A bit easy to get through the exercises but otherwise a very enlightening and inspiring course. - His is bow a positive review if anybody should be in doubt after taking this course :)
11092,Well laid out course with concise course ware focused on the core areas.Thank you Onset Ni!!
11093,Excellent introductory course with sufficient details
11094,His course is knowledge heaven for someone looking for great insight into the field of Digital Marketing. Professor Uric Rindfleisch and University of Illinois have beautifully structures the course by blending both theoretical and practical aspects into this 4-week information curve that will meet all your needs with regard to Digital Marketing.
11095,Great course for entry level knowledge of food and health. It was also a great refreshed and reminder on thinking how we eat and how we approach food.
11096,Too easy. :)
11097,His is actually a skill on his own. Vice you made a course just on this.
11098,"The information in the video was very interesting and well presented. I feel like I learned a lot. However, the quires and tests seemed to be of a very different level, and often covered material that was hardly discussed in the lectures. I understand that students are expected to do independent learning of material, but the gulf between lectures and test difficulty was extreme. Of others were interested in learning about the basis of music theory, I would not recommend this course."
11099,Good introduction.
11100,His is an excellent course. To much concept to learn and also build confidence in practices that one is following currently. I would highly recommend this to any leader who wants to build high performing tears.
11101,"Great course, as a beginner i could follow along and learn."
11102,Great introduction to the theory of strategic management. Feel like I learned a lot in a short few weeks. Workload is realistic for those with busy lifestyle. Looking forward to the next course in the specialisation!
11103,"Thanks a lot, professor Hurrah."
11104,Good course for absolute beginners. To prior programming knowledge needed.
11105,His course gives me a smile.
11106,"It was good but little bit too fast, and not obvious, i suppose it would be better it was over weeks for HTML5 things only."
11107,"For a newby course student, ""Learning Now to Learn"" is a great experience to start; course's itself is a key feature for the course; showing how to study for the other courses within the course, and for the life-long journey of learning."
11108,kind of boring and I am not learning how half this into is obtained or why it is relevant to real world chemistry
11109,excellent teaching .. very simplifies
11110,The information in this course is great
11111,"very interesting course, not only about patron and great introduction to internet protocol and how web service works from a coming perspective ! very useful and it is one of the best class attained on Coursera!!!! Thank you prof"
11112,Have me a great understanding of how my memory works! Very helpful!
11113,"His is a great introduction to Of printing. It covers the basis of different Of printing technologies, from desktop to industrial hardware. It shows the resources and services available to utilise Of printing effectively. It provides interviews with entrepreneurs and others in industry which are using this technology."
11114,Capstone was very well put together and by far the highlight of the course! Amazing job by the course developer to create such an interactive final to the course that brought together all the concepts into a real world stimulation!
11115,Should be a prerequisite course for all other courses in the webster
11116,Course Academy and historic
11117,it was awesome. Thanks a lot !
11118,Great course. The video are jam-packed with information which makes it really worth your money and your time. I am a self-taught designer and truly appreciated all the very specific tips and rules that are not as obvious when you start out on your own.
11119,"Professor Zelikow is making the subject interesting and is presenting me, for the st time with insight into the causes of many wars and revolutions in not only the American, but also in Europe and how they were all largely tied to the same causes. It has also opened my eyes to what is going on in the World today and how similar some of the underlying causes are the same now as they were in centuries past."
11120,Great!
11121,"Vice course, easy to understand, lectures are very clear"
11122,"Great, There is very useful content here. I regret why I wasn't pass this course before this."
11123,His course is very realistic and practical in nature. Professor Rodriguez -Baptists has an incredible way of relating the information and illustrating the practical application of tools and models to the real business environment. Highly recommended!
11124,"A good introduction of HTML, CSS, JavaScript (libraries, functions, objects etc.,), Tax and JSON. The instructor was very good and explained topics well through explanation and through code examples. Would recommend it."
11125,"Is with the previous courses on this Specialiazation, the instructor makes the difference. With detailed examples, clear explanations and a very handy supplementary e-book provided for free, this is a must course for everyone wanting to learn Statistics. Highly recommended!"
11126,"His is as good a course as I have had including all my live courses as an undergraduate and through my decorate. His man really knows how to teach a complex course,"
11127,this lesson offer much help for new comes in this domain like me.
11128,A must for wannable computer week.
11129,Excellent course to learn basic aspects on how to write professional email.Very useful for those who need to do so everyday at work.
11130,Good information and great instructor.
11131,Great teach
11132,"In one word, It's awesome course"
11133,His course really great.
11134,Thank you you are great
11135,"Thanks for the great course. of was just right level of business/hardness. While the quires were basic, the homework quires were hard but not unsociable. These actually motivate to further spend time on familiarizing with the tools, which is essential for home usage.Sometimes the video had their length when we watched somebody else tying... that could have made better."
11136,I enjoyed the course and find it very motivation and valuable. I started to apply technique from the course and see results immediately.
11137,"Once again, another excellent course from Or. Chuck. However, the Coursera format has changed from that of the previous two courses and the submission of quires and assignment are now locked; they don't show progress or get marked as completed unless you purchase the mortification. To, if you're auditing the course, don't bother with the quires and don't expect the course to show your progress (mine still says I'm on week one) or be marked as completed in your profile even though you've watched all the video and submitted the assignment.Or. Chuck, I understand that University of Michigan has to find a way to monetize these courses. However, since the previous courses used auto traders, and this course seems to as well, I'd like to request that the quit and assignment features be unlocked so auditory can see course progress and completion like the previous two courses."
11138,Such more difficult assignment than taught in lectures
11139,Great lectures and very well structures.
11140,A great introduction to GIS.
11141,"His course is as awesome as the other ones in the series. I love the way things from all the courses(SQL, accepting data from web API's etc.) merges together in the end. His course complements the others and the series as a whole reaches one enough to develop some useful programs.I wish there were more of coming exercises rather than just code completion. Overall, a great learning experience with Or. Chuck, the Pythonista."
11142,"Good, Comprehensive course on Planning & Design of Sanitation Systems and Technologies"
11143,I enjoyed this course to the fullest extent possible. I loved how they made a few short video every lesson instead of one long one like other courses provide. It made it incredibly manageable and easy to invest time into. It was a great learning experience and I will be looking into furthering my opportunities to become a published author because I now have the confidence and a bit more knowledge on the industry. Thank you so very much.
11144,The coarse precisely and concisely says everything about basic epidemiology.
11145,It was interesting to learn via Coursera. By very first time online course ever and I enjoyed it. :)
11146,Well structures content and interesting assignment!
11147,"A fascinating personal account of the atrocity while the world watched! His class is for everyone there is so much more to learn, thank you for everything you went out of you way to help, God Less"
11148,"A very enjoyable course which has provided me with further knowledge with regards to understanding our relationship with dogs. Up to date and using as much new research as possible, alongside with historical studies, it made it an interesting comparison to further improve our understanding of dogs. It was ideal for me to use as CPD for my continued membership of the dog training organisation of which I am a member (APDT of)."
11149,It goes step by step leading you to a clear understanding of the subject. The assignment proposes you a challenge which inspires you to get good solutions. I've learnt a lot from this course. Thank you!
11150,"Really good course as introduction to Sustainable development, includes main concepts and history require to have a general understanding of the subject. Very good examples and tests"
11151,"A really very good introductory course for the beginners in the field of electronics, I do recommend it. And a BIG thank you to all of you who have put a lot of effort and made the course available to us, may God bless you all."
11152,Incredible collection of graph algorithms. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
11153,Fool! It help me learn many things from ports to science and remember things more easily.
11154,good introduction on the lingo and bird's eye
11155,"Very good organized and helpful. I liked the mode of approach, and at some points I got so inspired. Thank you very muchSincerely,Davronbek"
11156,The lessons are laid out in a very organized manner. It is easy to review what was taught and the quires and assignment are not too difficult.
11157,"Would've been more complicated and in-depth, but I suppose for a Coursera lesson it was fine. Mind felt like a Pale advertisement, more than a finance course. Prof. Achilles was very good, I do enjoy listening to his lectures, interviews and any other material i can get my hands on."
11158,"Good course, ideal for the first half of a second course in computer science. A little cava experience is recommended buy you'll probably be ok if you have program in a ecstatically type programming language before because you can pick up cava very quickly. The lectures are very good, I think that the teachers are excellent depositors but I feel that they could be more detailed. The project is about representing earthquakes in a map and you are always increasing the complexity. Finally you need to add your own extension which I found an excellent opportunity to test your imagination and your capacity to create new things.The only sons of the course for me is the way assignment are evacuated. I think it has to do with the fact that they are interactive. You have to answers questions in a Ruin related to the week content and the project. But the are not very demanding, therefore they do not reflect how much you really know.In general I recommend taking this course if you are in self study journey in computer science, even more the specialization start to get more interesting and demanding in the follow up courses, more complete and detailed."
11159,Excellent structure and content!! Thank you!
11160,A very detailed and thorough explanation accompanied with a very apt set of assignment - and the plus point is that it all comes from the creator of SCALA himself. That can one ask for more?
11161,Great Glass. I learned a lot of about marketing management.
11162,Very helpful and great experience for people with no prior knowledge of programming! Professor was entertaining and clear.
11163,His course helps to get those creative juices flowing. Well done.
11164,The course lets you access a wide range of resources that help you build a deeper understanding of the mass murder of European News. The questions in between video (lessons) are helpful in processing and synthesizing soil-political events and ideologies that led to the holocausts. Two weeks into the lesson and I have never been bored - it is interesting and engaging.
11165,"Very nice course that reaches you how to create web pages by using HTML, CSS and Javascript.He consistent on watching the lectures, reading the material and learning and trying all the concepts presented every week.And last, but not least, please don't be afraid of asking questions by using the forum. There's always somebody who will give you a hand or who might have the same questions as you do!"
11166,l really liked this course. Very professional and the teacher is very clear!
11167,His is the course #1 on machine learning.
11168,His course is the greatest ever made !
11169,"Too prescription and prone to lists. ""To these 21 things when editing a novel"". Of that's what I was looking for, I could search the web for blows. Maybe this was too beginner focused for me, but I'm not sure I learned anything really useful here."
11170,"A Fig Thank You from the bottom of my heart to Andrew G sir and entire team.I loved this course a lot.It is well designed and well paced. Discussion forms are really useful.Well elaborated programming assignment and no penalties for crossing deadline made it possible for me to complete this course, along with a job in software industry.Thank you so much again. Love from India :)"
11171,Great Course
11172,"I learned so much in this course (especially considering the amount of time I put into it). I was really impressed with the quality and content of the course (SWIRL exercises, video, and the week 4 programming assignment all went a long way toward growing my skill as a data scientist)."
11173,Great course by a great scientist.
11174,Vice content and great lectures!
11175,"Great course, I learned a lot about programming foundations. Of you do not know anything about programming, this is the course to start. The teachers explain very well with good examples and the tasks are a challenge but well explained and these can be completed with the material learned in the video."
11176,Thanks for the course lectures and provides .It s a really great opportunity for whom to learn about MSW management. There are key points information about MSW management with enhanced visual materials from worldwide
11177,I liked this part of the course. I have learned some new ideas about using technology in class. Thank you!
11178,"A very useful course.Although some homework is difficult, I really learn a lot from my study."
11179,West guideline for the students and very easy to understand each and every lessons.
11180,Very helpful information provided that I will use on a regular basis.
11181,Interesting information and a great aid in understanding the process of learning.
11182,His course is an invaluable education experience. I am so grateful to Had Washed and to all those who provided us with an extraordinary course. I learned so much in these three weeks and look forward to what I can learn in Part 2.
11183,It was a great course. Thank you
11184,"His is a great oportinuty to me, gain more knowledge in topics, issues and current affairs"
11185,Love this course :)
11186,Great lectures and the coming assignment solidity the new knowledge. Lots of context so that you can identify the tools of the trade.
11187,"It's a relatively short and easy course, but it has good lecture video and programming assignment.Also, I think that you would have to already have fairly good computer programming skill (either in Cava or some other language) to take this course, because it pretty much jumps right into adding complex functionality to existing programs to extend their behavior."
11188,the start has a step learning curve but starts to flatten from the second week. Learned a lot though
11189,"Excellent course. Thoughtfully presented, by an instructor with considerable expertise in the field of evolutionary psychology who has also spent a lot of time thinking about religions and religious experience. Right is ideally suited to navigable the content, and his interviews with other experts in the fields (and the fields are diverse) add greatly to the learning experience. Fantastic experience overall."
11190,Last assignment was pretty rough because there appears to be a lot of functions required that weren't covered in class but maybe it got lost in the amount of information thrown at you in the short time. Or perhaps searching how to use new functions is part of the point. Great class and learned a ton!!
11191,"The entirety of this course is ""watch and listen"". There are no hands-on activities/assignment that get you implementing what you are (supposedly) learning. The assignment that are offered are optional and consist of filling in the blank code without actually providing you a way to see how your code works in the big picture.For example - they go on and on about how intents are complicated and tricky, but they don't actually give you a required assignment. It's optional. When the actual assignment is ""To this here, and this here, and then this here"" and only when you have completed every step can you actually run the code. But this doesn't actually show you how to build the intent. All you did was write down what they told you to and where. You never actually build anything yourself. You don't actually get an idea of how these things work or how to implement them yourself from scratch.The quires are also painless. Very quit is multiple choice, select all that apply. There's no thought required, just regurgitation of into from the lectures.Also, the entire week 1 lectures are HORRIBLE. The lectures on git are sssoooo dull that I could not stay awake no matter how much I wanted to. They are given in a monotony, bored tone that will drive you insane.Overall, this course seems more like it was hastily slapped together, without much thought, and then never looked at again. I would not recommend anyone take this course, let alone pay for it."
11192,thanks for the lectures. the best so artery information. never knew system designer have to go through a lot to make it unable. now now am a system designer :)
11193,Great course. Learned a great deal!
11194,"His course is an excellent, comprehensive, introduction to Etats. It is challenging, but in a very good way. Expectations are set sufficiently high that you need to grasp the concepts to succeed. Excellent MOOC!!"
11195,West Course I have ever seen and Or. Cockell is a really nice person. He made me really fascinate in the field of science.
11196,Perfect for beginning and intermediate graphics designer. The explanations of concepts and exercises are quite useful and makes the foundations of graphics design clear and accessible. Highly recommended.
11197,hard to follow.. usually I don't know what is he talking about..
11198,"His is a great course. Unlike Andrew G's Machine Learning course, this course does not shy away from using real mathematics to explain the models being studied, and is all the better for it. Some of the explanations were a little mysterious to this student (e.g. how can you discuss smiling of restricted Boltzmann machines, which are essentially tripartite Using models, without mentioning conditional probability?). However, Professor Into motivate everything so well that I always *wanted* to understand what was going on, and so frequently would pause the video while I consulted other online resources to find out more about the topic at hand. The programming assignment were also well-designed, so that I found myself forced to confront various aspects of the models and algorithms that I'd thought I'd understood the first time round but in fact had not. Thank you Professor Into."
11199,Great Course
11200,His was really valuable in terms of how to document correctly and produce reproducable reports.
11201,Lectures have very poor teaching skill.
11202,Excellent! Must enjoy and do it. The best course/specialization in Coursera so far.
11203,Did not email when grade and had to email for everything to be fixed. Example projects were not similar at all to actual projects and relied heavily on search engines to figure out what was asked of me
11204,"I loved how the courses assumes no previous knowledge, and allows for a slow build of coming know how. I especially enjoyed the examples that I could code along with in IDLE. I don't pretend to understand coming after this course, however think that it is a could foundation for f"
11205,Very well done! I am very grateful for all the people who helped putting this course available online. Thank you Professor A. It was a pleasure watching the video and reading the well selected material. I will keep going. ;)
11206,Great first step to Chinese!
11207,Great into to HCD. The assignment were well thought out. Excellent instruction.
11208,"While I learned so much, I realize that there is so much more I need to understand and grasp!"
11209,More in-depth analysis would have been amazing.
11210,"The capstone is really good.Too bad it means the end of this specialization... I liked it here.But it is also the beginning of playing more with ROS, stimulation tools and real roots."
11211,it is well designed and clear lesson. I understand very easily thank you.
11212,It was short and interesting... and that is good. In the first week the reading were overwhelming and I was disappointed - but the other 5 weeks had short video of interviews with photographer to go along with the concepts presented. Some of the quit questions were looking for details that I felt were not important for the learner. Final assignment was good.
11213,very very fine
11214,"It is indeed very instructions! I really learned a lot with each assignment, some have been easy and some have been hard to work, but in the end everything is well explained."
11215,"The course itself is exceptional. Instructor elaborate everything perfectly, but it takes really longer time to receive peer-reviews to pass the course. Also course doesn't have any forms where students can post that they need peer-reviews (which can be helpful to finish the course in timely manner)."
11216,"I would have given this course 5 stars if not for the final exam, which is to look at a peg and then write code to make a web page look exactly like the peg. The issue is that there are many ways to get a page to look like the image and you will still fail the exam. The course creator have realized this and you now have supporting questions that you can pass the course on even if your page code is not validated as correct. In my opinion there are so many better ways this final exam could have been handled, for instance i would have like to have seen a few more questions in the exam, and once passed you could see a forum area open up for us all to paste our code in or link to a page where we could discuss with teachers and operators etc. personally I believe that sort of approach would add more value.The above being said the content of the course is excellent for beginners with an eye opening focus on inaccessibility and good content on the DOM structure. The course will provide you with a good set of tools to get a basic page up on the internet."
11217,"Very clear in explanations, I learnt a lot of new cool stuff.Assignment aren't always so trivial but there's always a hint to help in solving them"
11218,One of the better online courses I have used.
11219,A great course! I definitely recommend taking it to whoever is concerned about energy independence and climate change. Professor Hilton gives a solid overview of the facts that one needs to know to better compare current technologies and the emerge
11220,Great course.
11221,"His Course is simply awesome!Putting edge insight into the data industry ,along with real time problems faced by the experts.You cannot go wrong with this one, HIT ENROLL NOW!!"
11222,Excellent topic and clear explanations.
11223,By first step to learn Chinese!
11224,It has been an awesome course!!! Definitely it was a very good choice. Thank you so much for so much learning! I hope to be able to do more studies with you. Greetings from Colombia!
11225,Unique course giving great soft skill for interview preparation and also soft skill for working as a software engineer in practice. His course has given me insight into my strength and weaknesses as a software engineer. Awesome course.
11226,Great course! I liked how the focus was mainly on the practical aspects of data science. To 'dry' course material. I know much more about the practical side of data analysis than before! Thank you!
11227,Vice learning.its better if we have continuation course
11228,101 linguistic
11229,Some!!
11230,The instructor is very annoying and he talks way too much about non important stuff.
11231,Fantastic course. I wish I knew about this course earlier!
11232,His course presents various methods to earners and teachers how English should be taught in an extremely effective manner. The video are well prepared and each lesson has been provided a well structures lesson for all kinds of earners. Deep it up!
11233,"For what you pay for, this course is not worth it. While I was able to follow the lectures, the material is very introductory and I was hoping to learn more. The lectures are really short in duration and the quires aren't challenging. I feel that pricking of this Specialization is purely due to the brand name of Phaeton. Please improve this Specialization to encompass more depth in the course material or lower the price."
11234,"There are some inconsistencies in the course or the arrangement of the video, maybe due to technical problems.For improvement I would really wish to have some substantial results, especially in the last week of the course. That is, I would prefer to discuss at least something in depth rather than everything broadly."
11235,"I really enjoyed this course, and as an Australian it is so exciting it comes form a domestic university. Thank you"
11236,Excellent class for beginners of web.
11237,"It was a very interesting course and I like it very much. Thank everyone, who have been spending time to create it"
11238,Excellent introduction to Unity. I learnt a lot in this short course.
11239,Very good prime on strategy.
11240,"Very basic introduction. Of you have any coming experience in other languages, this will be extremely simple."
11241,"A great course for beginners - if you have some experience with coming, you can finish the course in one week."
11242,Excellent thoughts and concepts presented.
11243,In this course we can learn about the fundamentals of front-end web development and some useful tools.
11244,"In excellent course. I have learnt a huge amount about algorithms. Really, really good!!"
11245,Very interesting course a great start for an specialization
11246,"Excellent course! I've learned these topics before, but many things were not clear enough. While learning this course my knowledge really improved a lot."
11247,His machine learning course is really good starting point
11248,Is a really interest and useful course¡
11249,"I can't believe I learnt that much!! Thank very much for offering so much quality in your courses and let everyone to be part of it, even if someone can't afford the certificate. Thank you!"
11250,"The transition from the original Coursera platform to the new one has significantly reduced my overall satisfaction with the course experience (I have previously taken the 4 earlier Vice courses in this series and enjoyed them immensely).Major contributing factors to my dissatisfaction:-- The user interface changes are unwelcome and have detracted from my ability to engage with the material.-- There have been arbitrary (and announced) changes to police, e.g. dropping distinction trading.-- The price increase per course and locking down of assignment to only those who have paid has unfortunate side effects, including.-- In contrast to previous courses in this series which had an active community engagement the discussion forms are now relatively empty, running the courses more often is not going to help this situation.Having previously been an unpaid evangelists for the Coursera approach and materials I now find myself extremely reluctant to recommend this revised experience to colleagues."
11251,I would suggest this really very good introductory course as a starting point to everyone interested in different philosophical questions.
11252,"Professor is great, explanations are extremely clear and valuable. Changed all the way i am studying now. Thanks for that very much!"
11253,I really liked it. They were good to explaining the material. They should off course but still.
11254,Of you really serious about security - you have to start with your hardware...
11255,"The teacher is not very enjoyable to listen to, however the content is very interesting."
11256,Great and very motivation into course.
11257,Fantastic course. It was well done and I really enjoyed the instructor's creativity when conveying the material.
11258,Excellent from start to finish! To enjoyable!
11259,"Simple and useful ideas and practices. helps you to understand why your learning has NOT always been successful in the past, and provides excellent printers on how to learn and retain what you have learnt."
11260,Great course.
11261,Its a very good course for students interested in learning all about Global warming and its imparts
11262,"Great Course, updated information perfect source to understand t"
11263,It is very clear and easy to follow for non-of background students. Highly recommended to start!
11264,"great course, have a nice tips to use"
11265,It is ok.
11266,Very well put together course. Sac and David have done a great job here.
11267,Its great
11268,"His course is not worth taking, especially if you have to pay for it! It is boring and you hardly learn anything. To not take this class, it is not worth your money."
11269,It was great to learn all basic of Revenue management. I have not remembered all words used for revenue management but could understand almost all. I will read materials and watch short moves again after this as well.
11270,"I liked that there were many practical exercises and it was talked about many crazy new technologies.Still, I feel that there was a lot of subtle publicity throughout the course and sometimes the focus was more on the promoting a brand than the lesson and knowledge itself (ex. hubs, the professors lab, Pari, ....).I understand that to understand better, we need examples, but I wonder if it could maybe be done in a different way.Nevertheless, I learned a lot.Thanks a lot for all the lessons!"
11271,"Is a of guy, I started this course to help myself in planning personal investments. Is stated in course, it didn't disappointed on what I was looking and helped me lot in understanding the Economic consideration for real investment. Enjoyed the course by exploring the new world. I would strongly recommend this course those who can make better plan for their financial investments."
11272,the course was information to me
11273,Enriching experience for the adventurous student.
11274,Vice job ! However some of the important points have been skipped and focus has been limited at times.The best part of the course were the lab assignment.Hope quires were better in standard.
11275,Excellent business and financial information.
11276,"Great course, very demanding, but it could use more reading material, ebooks instead of links on video."
11277,Excellent. The professor was just about perfect - high energy and very relaxed. He was a natural in front of the camera. The subject matter was interesting and information. Coursera and UVA are to be congratulated for providing such a great product. Nicely done.
11278,Insightful!
11279,Very interesting and helpful. Monitoring and reviewing made simple
11280,Great into to applied machine learning
11281,Very useful and interesting
11282,"A good introduction to AngularJS, but falls short on connecting the dots in places."
11283,"I found the production quality to be low enough to be distracting. Similarly, I think the scraping and performance are in need of being stepped up so they don't retract from the course. The concepts are useful and the facts of the topic are communicated well. However, many of the analogies used are childish and cheese, I think. Also, the presentation is , awkward and amateur/primitive, mio. These days, there are kiss putting out more gracefully performed and highly polish productions than this on Couture. That makes be believe that it's within the realm of possibility that the calibre of the MOOC be increased significantly.Thanks, for learning how to learn ;)"
11284,Very helpful for my graduate studies in Molecular Medicine! Thank you!
11285,wonderful course!
11286,I really liked to do it
11287,too easy
11288,谢谢Coursera，给予我旁听免费受教育的机会，谢谢你Thank you Coursera
11289,The class was fun and easy to fit in my schedule. The lecturer was fantastic and it was an enjoyable course!
11290,"Great course! Some assignment are too easy, though. He might learn more of the material if they get a bit more challenging."
11291,The course was very detailed and complete. I learned a lot. It was a very good course.
11292,"Well-articulated, in-depth and well structures course. His will revolutions the your Classroom experience."
11293,Learning from Or Chuck is great.
11294,"Thank these outstanding teachers, this course taught me a lot!"
11295,"Hands-on training, practical introduction to machine learning using R!"
11296,"great course for anyone interested in lines/evolution/birds, the extensive course notes were helpful"
11297,"Outstanding course, the best one of my life!!!!"
11298,Quite interesting with lots to learn.
11299,"The course is absolutely fantastic, education and well designed.Thanks to Onset University and Coursera.Love You"
11300,It's a great course helping me understand what green economy is and what to do in our lives.It also makes me notice the co-table in the supermarket which I didn't know.
11301,"You get out what you put in - this course is challenging but it supplies a very good mathematical background for machine learning. Of you take the time to learn this material well, you will be very well equipped to understand and apply these technique to any field of research you are interested in."
11302,Great to begin learning SEO!
11303,"Since this course is about practice, more impetus should be given on practicing the concepts. The concepts should have been taught in 'Marketing Analytics in Theory' course."
11304,"His course is helpful, both for life and for professional improvement."
11305,Great course for beginners. Very well designed. Thanks a lot.
11306,"learning how to learn is very useful and powerful mental tools that helped me to understand the best way of learning. thanks for course.org and university of california, san diego"
11307,great initiative to learning oil and gas field...more to come...
11308,Very helpful for writers and future career writers. Plus the professor is extremely down to earth. Was not expecting that and I forgive her for being a Duke fan. To War Feels!!!! j j
11309,His was another outstanding course. I will review what I've learned because everything was useful.
11310,"Is non-education major, presenting the approaches using a historical timeline is helpful. His way, it was easier to see the weakness of each approach although it could get quite confusing at times because a few approaches have significant overlap."
11311,Excellent Course....Learn't the basis of web development real quick
11312,Livid explanations gives crystal clarity of language. Will definitely recommend to friends and acquaintances!
11313,"Excellent! Brian is very simple and clear in his instruction. To messages missed or trouble understanding the program. Also, when you think your system doesn't have something, they provide you with the equivalent of what they is required. For example in the build case and getting Web Ll support. yeah! You'll see it.Thanks, I had a lot of fun doing this course. Now on to the next!!Go"
11314,"Very nice Course, highly recommended for beginners like me, who want to understand fundamentals of how supply - chain works."
11315,Great introductory course!
11316,"Really poor approach to grade this course. Regardless of the effort put in on assignment, peer reviews are inconsistent, guided and poor as a result, bringing down the final grade one is likely to obtain on a course. There is also a limited course support from the staff and no feedback in general for any of the issues raise. Personally I would not recommend"
11317,I enjoyed this course. Thank you very much for the material!
11318,"I enjoyed the teacher. In online classes the teacher can make or break a class and this teacher did a great job at keeping my interest because he was obviously passionate, information, and intriguing. Thanks for the great class!"
11319,Great Introduction!
11320,"Moved every example that was given and appreciated the instructor's thorough explanation for each step of the negotiation process. Thank you, George!"
11321,"Amazingly helpful course. Takes things step by step, very comprehensive, 10/10 would recommend to any beginner interested in learning Chinese!"
11322,Great tutor and interactive build up from fundamentals to the very challenging concepts..
11323,Mean too heavily towards theory instead of practice. I do think peer-grade assignment work better than quit in term of of lessons...
11324,good course. An be better in terms of information and assignment.
11325,The course is great.
11326,His course is simply great.Complex topic and advanced mathematical concept are explained in a comprehensive way.Assignment are well explained and guide me in many problems requiring machine learning approach.
11327,Very moving and presents a lot of good information on the basic issues transgender people face.
11328,A complete and didactic course.
11329,"Really helpful course, it has changed my studying and teaching skill. Toe I really want to start new things and share this course with everybody."
11330,Very useful!
11331,His is very interesting
11332,Great explanation!
11333,very good class to learn patron
11334,"a little more help from the video lectures is expected. The assignment required a lot of self study which is great but at the beginning, every assignment looks dancing and discourages a little. Although the forms helped a lot in getting through this course, but the majority of the roadway to take, and all other lessons should be included in the video."
11335,"very nice! A little bit more of reading material would be interesting, though.."
11336,"Compact, information and practical"
11337,Difficult topics made made to understand.
11338,A lot of information there. :)
11339,"His course provided me with a a set of takeaway tools that I can beverage on projects for attribute driven design. The focus on methodology, design, peer review, and patterns and tactics would benefit any architect that may be interested in this design approach."
11340,Excellent courses in a simple but deep understanding way of of.
11341,"His course gave me a new understanding of modern art, and also about the artists and the works selected for the course. The content has been carefully selected and the reading material is very interesting."
11342,"His is the second Coursera course that I have completed; although, I have enrolled in many. Or. Chuck is one of the best MOOC professors that I have every encountered by far. His course and the quires/projects were challenging, but not intimidating. Typically, I have found a discontent between the lectures/reference material and the quires/projects; however, Or. Chuck has struck the perfect balance."
11343,Helps me to start off learning another new programming language. Provides me an alternative perspective when approaching problems at work.
11344,Fantastic course. Quite challenging but it is really worth for people looking to learn patron and some of the key concepts in data science. I definitely will continue with the following patron courses part of the specialization
11345,"The trading seems to round up to 100%, which makes the assignment that are already generally easy far too easy. I took this course instead of just doing my own thing so that I could get some structure and motivation. While there was some structure, it was quite basic, and the motivation was diminished by ""good enough"" not being much. I was considering taking the later courses in the specialization, but I'm afraid that without real trading I won't learn as much as if I learn more slowly outside of Coursera."
11346,It is the most useful and instructive course that a per
11347,"It's interesting,,,"
11348,Really excited for this class!
11349,"Unlike the previous course in this sequence, this course provided little to no substantial information. While I fully agree with the premise of the course, the importance of leadership communication through storytelling, this course presented no sources, psychological research, or evidence to defend its arguments. It provided great ""lay advice"" with little to no research base. I would not recommend this course for anything beyond casual reading. It is not substantiate."
11350,"Great course. Any tools to improve learning and studying in a short time, all of them so simple and yet effective!"
11351,It is interesting and useful for my life and work.
11352,"Excellent course as excellent is THE STRATEGIST'S TOOLKIT book (my guide, my adviser). That I am leaning with Professor Lenox is really of a great value because when I hear his lesson automatically, come to my head many ideas that allow me to see my failures and mistakes that I will try not to repeat again, and at the same time, new ideas flow to be analyzed and decide whether or not to be put in practice for better results."
11353,Very good into course
11354,"I enjoyed this course very much! I am an electrical engineering students and have some background on linear algebra and radiant descent algorithm, this course difficulty was very suitable for me. Assignment are amazing - I didn't know certain simple algorithm like logistic repression can do powerful work like handwriting digit recognition!"
11355,"His course is extremely helpful! Ironically, I started the course when I just graduated from college. I found out that I have been using efficient technique to study all my years in school (e.g. using mere will power to force myself into problem solving, studying long sessions without taking breaks, falling into the trap of procrastinator, etc.) His course has provided me with many perspective in studying, and they are so convincing since they are backed up by evidences from neuroscience. The course is full of to-the-point tips and helpful advice, with a minimal level of technical details (just enough for a general audience).Any thanks to the team they created this course! Happy learning, everyone!"
11356,"It's too short, I think it should be a part of a course and not a course itself.It is a repetition of concepts and examples from other courses by john hopkins unit."
11357,Great course. Very interesting and great presentations.
11358,Basic course that give important information for every engineer. The course material is presented in a clear way.
11359,"Pretty exciting course, really objective, clear and resourceful."

11362,Vice course.. I have referred this webster to my friends to do mortification. Thanks course
11363,"Very good introductory course to Machine learning, though later parts of the course seemed to be rushed-through a little. Practical exercises were really great."
11364,I loved this course! By first real lessons into programming. Thank you to everyone involved in making this course!
11365,so important to get or submitting or a job vacancies
11366,Awesome experience
11367,Professor Charles Severance is awesome. Thank you for making programming so easy.
11368,Great for beginners with background in programming!
11369,"I have taken this course live in my university, but the mess way it was taught created so much confusion. Now, it's all being cleared up. I really appreciate the slow pace the course is taking and the way that difficult matter is easily explained by the professor. I am looking forward to taking other courses in the Specialization."
11370,"Really interesting to get such a deep perspective on Jefferson. I had very little interest in him, even growing up in his home state of Virginia, but now I can't wait to learn more. His is a great course worth a fantastic instructor. Highly recommended!"

11374,I enjoyed the course a lot and is very inspiring to pursue my degree in finance.
11375,"The course is very useful, it puts learning into a different perspective. The video are short and clear and tests help to recall the material. I recommend this test to anyone, even to people who know how to learn."
11376,Thank you Charles Severance and University of Michigan for offering this course online.I have now the basic knowledge for patron and looking forward to learn more about patron :)
11377,Pretty broad introduction to some different processes. Have a pretty good into to agile methodologies. I like that there was some depth in the explanation of Kanban. Looking forward to continuing in the specialization.
11378,"His free course, which is available for certificate now is well designed and covers a wide range of topics. The Professor of course is an authority in the subject. I think it serves well for both experienced earners and new earners alike. Before anyone ventures on any other MOOC course in this area, they must first check this course in my opinion."
11379,Excellent information presented in a clear manner. I was able to put many of the suggestions to use immediately.
11380,I strongly wish to have English for Journalism 2.
11381,His course has really helped to fill out my piecemeal understanding of the development of rock music. The pace and content of learning has been well considered and Prof Coach is to be congratulated.
11382,Chuck is the best teacher.
11383,Very interesting and information course. Thank you for everything!
11384,"Great introduction to engineering processes. I was hoping, however, to gain a bit more insight on general details of structures and mechanics, such as what types of materials or designs should be used in certain situations and why. His course covered only mathematics, which while essential, are not the only aspect of engineering in real life applications."
11385,Outstanding class to help understand machine learning. His course will demystify many of the applications that you find on the web. The amount of programming is very limited by making use of Active.
11386,Easy and well explained! I super recommend this course!
11387,course and professor are great!
11388,very emotional
11389,It's very fine course!
11390,very practical and updated course
11391,i really liked the course thank you so much
11392,Very good basic course. The printouts are a tremendous help.
11393,the weeks are not marketing online students. The video are long but not teaching many things. The course is too general.
11394,Very Good and useful course
11395,His was good module. It covers the basis of differential statistical technique along with its application using SAS/Python. I would definitely recommend to take up if you are a beginner.
11396,"I like it, great course. this even if my connection isn't so good in this days, but luck"
11397,"His course is a great introduction to the basic aspects of the Peter framework. Even thought you haven't taken the previous courses on this specialization, you can get a long well as long as you have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.Cry to read about the principles of Peter to get a better understanding of it either."
11398,"Very good presentation from the lecturer, Mob Tone. Information was given very clearly and very easy to understand. Materials needed for further reading are given."
11399,Run & easy introduction to basic concepts in Good and Health.
11400,"Excellent course. I appreciated the notes, teaching from experts in the field and being exposed to new information and research that was new to me. Thank you. - David Waited"
11401,It's an excellent course for people with and without prior coming experience.Heals with all basis necessary to kick start an interest and insight to MATLAB.Advanced courses of the same would be greatly appreciated.
11402,I have always struggled to learn in school and now as an adult I feel a renewed sense of vitality in knowing that it was only a matter of knowing the effective ways to learn! I am re-considering going to graduate school now because of this course!
11403,Great interviews inside the course content!
11404,"I did not find the course very good. I came into the class with only real basic knowledge of Python and I was hoping to be able to pick up more as part of this class. while I might have picked up more, it was only because I used resources outside the course.The video instructions in programming in Python left quite a few gaps to figure out by reading documentation. The video themselves were divided into two sections -- first a theoretical or classroom like section and a second a lab/programming section going over some coming in Python. The 'classroom' type lectures were pretty reasonably good. But the lab/programming were pretty terrible.They instructor really break down the santa of the code and just left the student to figure it out. His made being able to take this code and to adapt it to other uses very difficult.I would not recommend this as a course to help learn Python."
11405,I would have liked better tools to do this type of work.
11406,In my opinion this course is highly technical and demanding in nature compared with the others. The learning experience is good and course.org has given a opportunity for customization ! thank you Coursera
11407,Interesting and useful technique that I'll definitely use in the future for my future personal learning. I now aim to read the book
11408,"nice course! great teacher, very helpful for advanced!"
11409,"Eye opening course, interesting content easily explained concepts and fantastic practice materials. Highly recommend this course to start creating conscience on issues affecting us all."

11411,Enjoying this course so much!
11412,To great!
11413,"Completed the course and found it pretty good for the first run. Mostly focused on the Hands library - you'll be ok if you know a bit of Python, or have experience in another language.Looking forward to subsequent courses."
11414,"Very good overview of theory, specific algorithms, and some practice of application in MATLAB. There's a lot of material to cover and the video are longer, requiring self-pacing throughout the individual lectures. Some of the weeks are very challenging. Extracurricular study, practice and implementation helped in areas where I had yet to encounter supporting material and/or prerequisites."
11415,"In general good, but not updated - seems from around 2013, so the new developments are not mentioned."
11416,"It is such an interesting course, I learned a lot about sanitation. Thanks"
11417,very useful
11418,"its so useful course , I arrange so many things in my day , and sources are rich actually ."

11446,Really A great course which gives a awesome kick-start for diving into Data Science.
11447,Excellent teacher
11448,To information & useful courses. also encouraging me to study!
11449,"The professor does not evaluate your assignment. Your classmates do, giving you sometimes unfair qualifications. I won't continue with the rest of the course because of that. I think University of Washington or Coursera should have said this at the description of the course so people can decide better if take it or not."
11450,"Ancient Greeks is brief overview of Greek civilization from about 1800 to 320 of, starting with the Minoans of Rete and ending with the death of Alexander the Great. Prof. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak demonstrates great knowledge about the subjects, covering literature, government, and philosophy.Met the course has two stacks: 1) The professor shutters through the lectures, displaying his obvious discomfort being on camera; and 2) the overview is very expensive, so there isn't great study in any single theater of Greek civilization.There is, however, solid coverage. I also felt the chapter on the th cent. of, done to address complaints about no coverage of Alexander and Macedon, feels tacked on. It's a long, but somehow hurried lecture.That said, I liked this course. I gained greater knowledge of important political and literary figures, such as Colon and Alcibiades, than I did when I studied the subject back in college."
11451,"Useful, mostly common sense, but I definitely picked up a few new tips, and as explained in the course, a small change can make a big difference."
11452,Great instructor! Very good content and reference reading. I only wish the course wouldn't be so introductory.
11453,The best smiling teach ever
11454,Wonderful! Both material and teachers are very interesting. An't wait to continue their next class.
11455,"Really enjoyable, clear and straightforward introduction to html"
11456,Good course

11458,Wonderful experience doing this course.
11459,Very Insightful course !!! Changed my way of thinking a lot...!
11460,Very clear course material and lectures. And to access all this at no charge makes it extremely valuable.
11461,"Excellent course if you are interested in health, diet, quinine and welling. Teachers have solid knowledge and explain contents clearly. Taking this course has been very interesting and enjoyable!"
11462,"Amazing!! Thank you so much, I have learned a lot"
11463,"Thank you very much for the course. It allows to understand the peculiarities of the clinical picture of depression, as well as risks. Most useful what is paid to the issue of reducing depression at the population level. Thank you very much. Aleksey Melehin (Moscow)"
11464,it is fantastic to learn your big idea
11465,I am really enjoying this course
11466,Very good and interesting course although there was not much feedback and replies by the University.
11467,"Quick and easy. But I would have liked more examples. For instance, how NPV and IRR actually works on Expel. Luckily, I have some prior knowledge of the subject, but sometimes it was not so clear for a complete beginner."
11468,Great course!! Love it!!
11469,The course was really good. Not to learn so much about parallel programming with that course. The explanation level is very basic and any Computer Science related person can easily grasp the concepts
11470,it is a great course
11471,"Brilliant course, full of golden suggest. Uric is a master at articulating the SEO / Social Media across and lessons are concise and to the point, with no lumbo lumbo margin straight up plain English. You would be foolish to miss this if undertaking the specialization path."
11472,His course easy to understand and easy to follow.
11473,very well designed course takes through the various aspects of HTML 5. the course provides with just enough information to understand and keep the student motivate to go and explore more.
11474,"good practical examples, useful materials. Good job Will!"
11475,"Excellent nodules, excellent teaching, excellent moderation and responsiveness from the tutor. I was not expecting this quality. Really good!"
11476,"Horrible, endless rambling, no solutions to the quit questions (unlike cal 1 course). sucks all the fun out of path, avoid this course, find an alternative where you can learn more with less time spent watching him write out 20 numbers."
11477,I really enjoyed this course. The subject matter was very thought provoking or perhaps it better said that it was thought managing. Great presentation by the professor and the obvious interest that he has in the course himself came across very well.
11478,Very useful and very interested course.
11479,"First and most important: I'm very grateful and honored by taking the course from Professor Achilles, who is clearly a person of great knowledge and intelligence. Examples from real life and history, which he provides during the lectures and the whole ""context"", so to say, of humanization and demoralization of finance - all of it is just great for the introduction course in financial markets. Guests parts of video are very important and helpful as well.Second and less important: this course, from course (not ""live"") perspective, is rather explicit, but still ""contents page"" of a financial book. Amount of abbreviations, mostly of, are just a waste of time in my opinion. Week, where lecturer talks about option markets is a weak part of the course.Nevertheless, if you are completely new to finance and you have some free time for an additional information about the subject - good course. Any other case - not so good."
11480,Great overview of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device industry.
11481,Great course... learnt a lot.. thank you Coursera
11482,"It's very simple presentation for the topic. I believe that course is a Professional site for earners. To , I don't think people who visit this site don't know these basic rules. I mean what is to, of, subject or stuff like these. I thought, the course give us more specific materials that we able to use when we write an email, for example, inside of the mail what rules we have to consider or what words or Word structures we should use."
11483,"Learned quite a bit, but course was not as good as the first course of the specialization.Especially the presentations in week 4 are rather mess."
11484,Very nice course tormented with concrete application example.
11485,"These lectures are really helpful for people to understand current issues all the world; consequently, very one should learn them!"
11486,The material is not mature yet. Some things were not tested by the teacher before being part of the course and do not actually work. Questions asked on the forms about it got no answers before the end of the course.
11487,I am a newer. I think this class is very helpful!
11488,"His course gives you a head start to learn how to program Python in an easy and basic way.Of you don't know nothing about computers this is the best introductory course.Of you have some experience with computer but knows nothing about Python, this is also for you."
11489,great class
11490,Great introduction to Digital Marketing. I was able to obtain great insight on how the digital world imparts Marketing and consumer behavior.
11491,Great teacher. To funny! And very helpful information
11492,Really worth it. I am planning to complete all 6 courses and might take more as well.
11493,"There were some errors in the video playback, one entire lesson near the end seemed like it was skipped."
11494,It was really useful
11495,"His is the best course I have encountered so far. The instructor, Yakov clearly explains the theory, and demonstrated them through actually developing a restaurant webster. Even for an experienced web developer, there is something to learn from this course. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who would like to enhance their web development skill. Thanks to the Yakov and Coursera to sharing this course."
11496,Buddhist like but very interesting to consider evolutionary psychology. Excellent contributory to the course content.
11497,"Good Course, but it needs more focus on ContentProviders and Services."
11498,Interesting and very clearly explained!
11499,It was very enjoyable to learn Python in this course. I have programming experience so it was easy but the way this course was taught compared to other online classes I have taken is exceptional. It was fun and instructions. Seeing video of other students around the world and the fun that Or. Chuck convey throughout the class made it so enjoyable. Thank you very much to Or Chuck and all his collaborators on this course. I look forward to one day to meet Or Chuck and personally thank you for being who he is a very giving individual and inspiring many others to do the same.
11500,Great insight into solar cells especially in regards to polymer and organic solar cells. The video lectures were clear and easily understood.
11501,very nicely deep detail on Scala and functional programming.
11502,"Good starting point to get familiar with some of the margin, methods and problems."
11503,I learned a lot of things related to journalism from such valuable course.
11504,Good Introductory Course but can be better.
11505,very helpful
11506,"I would like to receive a certificate, that's why I don't rate it with 5 stars."
11507,I learned a lot in this course and highly recommend it. I lived in Tianjin for over four years and often passed the old Synagogue and wondered about its history. The video in this series are well done and the information is just enough to be eye opening and engaging without being burdensome. I also learned quite a bit from the other participants in the course.
11508,Thanks for these useful tips and clear explanations on how our brain works :-)
11509,"A lot of reading material is available (link does not work or it is behind paywall).I also found the video lacking. For example, there were 5 important tips and only one was given, before jumping at next topic."
11510,"His is a really nice course, it has actually help me grow in the way i write a story! There are many things i am taking away, key tips and suggestions. One this that could be improved in this course was the assessment, none has assumed my work because of which my course it said to be incomplete. That could change, otherwise AWSOME!!!!"
11511,"Excellent, thorough course on repression! Thank you Emily and Parlor."
11512,The course is very useful which contains incredible information.
11513,Its a great course for utilizing database and related content with the power of patron... :)
11514,Very good with essential knowledge
11515,Easy to follow format and easy to work in to a busy schedule.
11516,"I learned a lot of important information that will help me deal with my child, of which I highlight: recognize characteristics of ASD; Strength and weaknesses; Types of intervention for the treatment of ASD."
11517,The course is rather interesting. However it is worth mentioning that the course is very initial introduction without detailed materials in the topic!
11518,"A perfect and balanced introduction to the subjects, adding theory and practice beautifully."
11519,The lectures were very interesting and full of valuable information. I tried another creativity course and preferred this approach much more. I would recommend this course to anybody.
11520,"Great course, taught you the in and out of Processes, Practices and Methodologies to ease you software development."
11521,"Course is easy, but that's fine. Or. Chuck explains and shows everything in an easy to understand way, and I know that I came away from this course with a ton of new ideas of what I can do."
11522,Take a step back and check if your learning technique are in good shape! It´s an eye-opening course that you'll want to retaken every now and then. I'll definitely come back to this course every month or so!

Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to learn the basis of finance. For reference, I have absolutely no background in finance so was starting from scratch."
11529,Good introduction for people who have no prior programming background
11530,Heavy lecture material. Programming assignment require some work or present knowledge of functional programming to successfully complete.
11531,"professor is very didactic.the main ideas were well explained, and the assignment was important to understand how to apply them. Also, by doing peer assessment my ability to think about the six steps in a more natural way has become apparent."

11536,Absolutely amazing! A must-take course for machine learning introduction!
11537,Great!
11538,Professor Dickson explains both the mathematical and physical definitions of all converted equations. His methods enable you to tackle more complicated problems while maintaining a physical insight (not just playing with the path). Very good deprivation of how to include losses and calculate the efficiency of a do-do converted.
11539,Considerably harder than the prior
11540,Such less technical than I had anticipated. Such more policy-driven. Disappointing.
11541,It's a Great course about patron. Thanks!

11551,"Awesome course; it's not only about the tool, but mostly about the rational behind what to do and how to do it."
11552,"Excellent course for a beginner or post-beginner as the fundamentals of pronunciation are dealt with slowly in the first half and then it races ahead with useful language and vocabulary for everyday contemporary situations like talking about hobbies, using the internet, etc etc. Stylistically, the Professor may seem dry and mechanical to some but I liked her. To fluff. The moves at quite a pace. For false-beginners, would have been nice to ave had access to the Chinese vocabulary during the course not at the end. Looking forward to the next course."
11553,Great course to understand responsive design and to take a nice and deep start up with bootstrap framework!
11554,"THIS of EASY of UNDERSTAND AND VERY WORTHY of LEARN! AND VERY USEFUL FOR DAILY LIFE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS CLASS. i WILL of HEALTHIER PERSON,"

11560,Very good course. But I think some exercises could be more difficult.
11561,Thanks to Or. Chuck.
11562,In interesting course even if you don't complete the assignment because you can expect to get around an 80% even if you fully grasp the subject matter due to the peer review requirement. The course would be much better without that requirement.
11563,Great course!!!
11564,I liked this class a lot. You should include lot more assignment which will help solidity the understanding of the underlying concepts.
11565,Professor Men White made the entire course enjoyable. The teaching tools he used was awesome! I will recommend it to other friends and colleagues
11566,"His is a pretty good course for learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I already had some experience with these three languages, so consider that when reading this review. I found that the amount of information they cream into this three week course was pretty substantial, which I think is a positive aspect of the course. They don't just teach you what you need to complete the exercises, they teach you a lot of things that even more experienced users of this language may have forgotten. That being said, I don't think the amount of information covered is realistically anyone could retain in three weeks. I would instead see this course as a crash course as to what features are available with these three languages, then save the course sides as sort of a reference for when you go off on your own. By favorite part of this course is that the exercises are unique and fun. The HTML assignment is sort of boring, but that's because HTML is boring, but the exercises that use javascript are a lot of fun. To conclude, I think this course would be great for brand new web developer and also for people who just need a refreshed. Good luck!"
11567,Beautifully taught and insanely comprehensive
11568,Great course though at sometimes the images in the background were more distracting than useful.
11569,Very helpful for my future projects!

11583,"His class assumes a lot of statistical knowledge and background that is not covered in the first three classes of the series. To much statistical terminology and margin was used by the instructor, it felt like taking a class in another language where I had to constantly stop the video and goose for the terminology she used. It took a lot of grit to finish the class, which was overall a very demoralizing and negative experience."
11584,Very good course that can help to find out or identify your own teaching method or philosophy

Love Learning team with all the Friday greetings."
11593,"Good concepts, very useful tips shared in this course.I reduced 1 star because, it has very less illustrations. Interactions, live examples could have been added in the content.Especially the video background is not good. It matters because, it's distracting while listening the class."

11600,Good knowledge sharing for a beginner.
11601,"His is a very good course, but I would have expected transcripts of the talks as well. I have done a few course courses and the supplementary materials here are minimal. Also, in the week 4, it is confusing to have the video transcribe in the assignment section - very unclear whether that's a part of the assignment or not."
11602,Extremely informing and education course.
11603,Great introduction that gradually adds complexity to build confidence. Highly recommended!
11604,"simple and easy for Python beginners, the instructor also has a textbook that could be good instruction."

The has a very engaging teaching style that makes learning both easy and fun! I never found myself getting bored with her lectures and, in fact, looked forward to watching them as I knew I was going to enjoy each module. I especially enjoyed the interviews with various professional in the marketing industry as I felt I learned a great deal from their added observations and expertise. For fellow English speakers, I highly recommend watching this course with subtitles on to get the most out of it."
11618,Andrew is a great teacher. I loved how he broke down everything into simple easily constable information. I came into this course with a relatively good understanding of Linear Algebra and Statistics so it made things a lot more easier. Highly recommend the course to anyone looking to get some hands on experience with Machine Learning.
11619,"It was a great learning experience. Of I may, I would have like if I had additional guidance while developing my financial plan for the project. It was very unclear about how to go about setting up the financial values etc. Some extra help would have been appreciated."

11624,"Very good material regarding machine learning, some more tutorials regarding matas/octavo need to be added"
11625,"I really like the structure of the course. Even though i had some experience with HTML and CSS before, this course definitely improved my understanding of the subject. I want to say thank you to the teacher, teaching assistants and everyone involved in creating of the course! Great job!"
11626,"While I enjoyed this course and learned quite a bit, I think the strong leaning of the content toward use of materials for educational purposes should be made much clearer in the class title and description. Another primary complaint is that many of the quit questions are are poorly written, requiring assumptions to be made outside of the information presented with the question. In a positive note, the wealth of supplementary content is very helpful."
11627,I love Prof A
11628,Really helps me with of

11633,A good overview of action pack and active record. Thanks for your effort dear course creator.
11634,"A great refreshed course for path. Depending on which way you look at the course it is either 4 or 5 stars, I wish I could give 4.5 for this reason! I'm not sure if it would be wholly sufficient for people new to mathematics trying to get into business/MBA as there needs to be more examples and problem sets. There could also be some PDFs added to further reinforce learning. However I still rate this course highly because I had no experience with marines but through the video as a sole resource I got a perfect score on the quit on the first time. Of you have a baths background you'll find this course the perfect refreshed for exploring your MBA option."
11635,It is really an excellent course and suitable not only to the beginners but also to an experienced programme like me.I really have got a lot of guns out of it and I donna start the next one the series:)
11636,Very good teacher! In easy approach to a complex issue.

I think it was a good way to learn illustration and infographics.The instructor is very knowledgable and experienced with visual and graphics design, so it;s good to listen to his ideas.The assignment take quite a bit of time for derbies to illustration like me."
11638,"There was little of actual teaching going on in this course, the pace was too rushed for beginners and peer-reviewing was managed so poorly it was helpful."
11639,Professor G is very good at teaching. The material is easy to follow
11640,"I am learning a lot, particularly that I can write up to several thousand words per day; not just words, but meaningful words."

11644,His course is very helpful. All the concepts are clearly explained and most of them are fairly useful.
11645,"Excellent course, the basis of Machine Learning are explained efficiently. It first I was disappointed that homework needs to be done in Atlas/Active instead of something more widely used like R/Python, but it occurred to be a nice language."
11646,Such a amazing course!!His course is amazing for whom is just stating in gazing de.
11647,"The course covered quite a decent amount of content, but personally I think it was a bit fast for a beginner."
11648,The course does not offer very useful material. The instructor speaks too slowly and it takes her a long time to explain simple ideas.

11650,Excellent! Very high quality for an introductory course. Absolutely recommendable.
11651,Excellent course and instructor. Very information!

11653,"Great introduction to Python, video were excellent - instructions were clear and easy to follow along. Really enjoyed learning using the assignment and autograder, thank you!"
11654,"Course is very intense. Good knowledge of Scala/Cava indeed needed for solving the assignment. But the topics were cool: functional programming combined with top principles and a horrid of those turned to pattern watching. Very class can be compressed, every object is a function. Absolutely top drawer of programming!"
11655,Great Course! I hope they update it for the new Python ve.x
11656,Vice introduction to problem solving and decision making.
11657,"Professor Him Fowler is amazing: great scientist with 'this' sense of humor that inspires me to study path more,more, more..."

11663,"Very well prepared material: video, interviews, further reading, quires, tests, with many opportunities to dig deeper into the topic. Professor Barbara Valley has an easy going, but always professional approach, with a great care for details and a tremendous ability to put them into the big picture and make learning fun and easy! Everything was really well curate and of high quality. Fig contributions also come from Or. Terence Sejnowski, which talks more about the neurological aspects related to learning. I have learned quite a lot of interesting technique that I can use to improve the way I study, even if I am at the end of my Oh.D. ! And not only technique, but also insight on how the brain works and how to relate this to the process of learning. Absolutely suggested to anyone interested in learning deeper and probably faster than before!"
11664,Excellent introduction to the topic

11669,"George Russell is a blessing. He gave me so much hope for music. I didn't know ANYTHING about piano before his course, now, I have already written about 5 songs with a band.Or. Russell is so concise and makes it of EASY to learn. I would fly to Berklee JUST to take a lesson with him.Angels come in many forms. Or. Russell is definitely one of them.Thank you Or. Russell.Leo A."
11670,"His Capstone Project requires a lot of effort and time, but it is definitely worth it. Anyone who takes this course will learn so much at the end and he/she would be prepared to start teaching."
11671,Very interesting course which talks about brain and how to use it effectively. Very useful for students but useful for other too who likes to learn.

11674,not very dynamic
11675,Good explanations about the topics.
11676,"Excellent introductory discussions in the video. The in-R Will tutoring is superb - a great way to force you to type out the basic concepts. Assignment are challenging as they leave a little ambiguity, making you get familiar with the help system and online searches. His course isn't the fattest way to get an overview of R, but it's a great way to get a little more than an overview, including some practical experience, if you're willing to put in a little time and work through some bump."
11677,Run course with some long lectures. I found the material to be quite challenging.
11678,"A very useful, well structures business course that enlighten the way to business professional and even states to launch and grow their business to greatness, through use of adequate tools, technique and processes.

11685,Greatly explained. Awesome topic
11686,Great introductory course. Helped me a lot to understand what linguistic do even if I didn't quite get all the key ideas which weren't all explained in depth enough. The examples from languages are helpful but require quite a good ear so I guess it takes some gift for languages.
11687,"Moved the course. Very professional, instructor was very warm and explained complex topics simply. Very nice combination of video, demon, and lecture. By only comment is that the quires do not align perfectly with the lesson. There are numerous examples of being quitted on something that isn't taught until the next lesson."
11688,"handy tool to pull out data and analysis, but the learner themselves need to practice m"
11689,It's very good

11698,That would be better than spending your free time watching at entertaining animation + gaining knowledge! Highly recommend this course to everyone!
11699,Very Good!!!! Excellent
11700,Excellent introduction to Machine Learning. Definitely lives up to it's reputation.
11701,Good vice but way too easy.... even for beginners! I am no beginner but I finished the whole thing in less than an hour.... Not much learned
11702,Very comprehensive course! Motivate you to start getting fit slowly but surely!
11703,"Very information, quite difficult, but very helpful and economically education course."
11704,It was my first course on course and i learnt a lot from this. I would recommend everyone who are interested in web development to take this course and benefit from it . And last but not the least Thank you Yakov sir for providing us this course.
11705,"Interesting perspective, and good tie in to modern psychology as promised."
11706,"I may have gotten more out of this course if I hadn't already read ""The Genius of Dogs"".I would like to suggest that the sides be subjected to more vigorous proofreading, as I came across several typographical errors. It doesn't look professional.In quires, when a student is asked to select the one FALSE answer, please remove any ""all of the above are TRUE"" statements. A enter replied to another student who pointed out this conundrums on the Week 7 Forum with: ""I understand where you are coming from Phil, but only one of the answers as an individual answer is incorrect. The answer ""all of the above are correct"" is neither true nor false, as only one of the answers in the 'all' is the exception."" And I say that if I have a bouquet of roses, 11 red ones and 1 yellow and I were to say that ""all of the roses in my bouquet are red"" you would correct me, as one is not, and ""all"" demands 12 out of 12, otherwise, it is not all. Should you still feel a bubble, let me suggest that you contact the Department of Philosophy, ask for someone expert in symbolic logic and run it by him/her."
11707,"Is good to have some data science background to knoll in this course, overall still good to learn and get the hint of how real life data scientist life is."
11708,amateurish presentation. and there is some technical issue with the content. the video gets stuck a lot and the problem is not my internet.
11709,"It was really a brilliant experience taking this course shared by course and Georgia Lech University. I learned so many new things about the energy sector like renewal energy sources, present energy scenario and effective utilisation of energy sources. Everyone should go through this course for having a sound understanding of energy conversion and utilisation because as the name suggest it really presents the big picture of energy."
11710,I love this course! It helped me so much since I'm beginning to lean Organ :)
11711,Moved the course. Learned many new technique which will definitely assist in my learning process in the future.
11712,"His is a reasonable course, I definitely learned some stuff about mechanics. Things were generally explained well, though there were some things that could have been explained better. The quires were very simplistic (the type of multiple-choice questions where you often don't have to actually be able to do the calculations to figure out the answer, you can just look at the option and rule out all but the right one)."
11713,Really helpful to understand basic bioinformatics.
11714,Sometimes the efforts of others makes life easier for us than th
11715,Excellent introduction to business strategy

11719,It is very good explained. Nothing more to say. Thanks for this good course.
11720,"Not even sure it worth one star, all due respect."
11721,"The course itself is good. Nevertheless, it says that it doesn't require any previous experience... But there is actually experience required on financial statements and concepts."
11722,His course is wonderful! Each video is not too long but full with information. You encourage me to choose a wealthier lifestyle. Thank you so much. I will use these knowledge to improve my family's health.
11723,"It was excellent refresh of the knowledge! Not to deep, but good enough for the starting point. Also they give you all the topics beforehand, so you could skin something you know already. But I didn't do that, the course was so nice, that I listened even about the things I knew."
11724,Some homework have challenges. But the discussion board and professor helps a lot!
11725,I am much more confident now to handle real world machine learning problems. The topic is elegantly presented. I am ready to dig deeper.
11726,Very good course. Instruction was very easy to understand.
11727,I've learned a lot - thank you!

11733,"Good for beginner, except for JavaScript part where you will need to study of externally as it may appear quite complicated without programming knowledge. Not so good for experienced desktop developer who wants to learn web: it's all too basic."
11734,Very good introductory course. I also enjoyed the looters
11735,Very information and relates to real life applications. 5/5 will take again. Professor is very well equipped to teach the course.
11736,I was expecting harder course with more content but this course for absolute beginners to web so I guess I can't say much bad about course only that I would like if it had more content and harder projects.
11737,"I enjoyed spending time on this course because I could learn, have fun, and exchange a lot."
11738,Like the fluttering
11739,Is usual for this speck - a very high quality course.
11740,"The core content of the course is really good. In the downside, there is, in my opinion, too big a focus on the unfolding map god. I would have preferred to code objects from scratch."
11741,very helpful !!!!
11742,"Excellent course. Great and useful examples given by instructor. Also, very helpful that editables files used in examples are available for students."
11743,A course that really makes you feel good
11744,a very good into but i feel it may do with more detail
11745,His course is great! Take sure you try and do the assignment without the step by step directions and the end will be a breeze!
11746,"Great video, medium difficulty programming exercises with detailed instructions, even for beginners."
11747,"Excellent course! I can recommend this to anyone who is not afraid of some basic path. But a person interested in cryptography should not be afraid of path, yielding that this course can be recommended to anyone interested in cryptography."
11748,Perfect lesson.Thanks Andrew G!
11749,very great
11750,His class gives me a very useful knowledge that help me a lot in my work. The teacher's lecture is very suited with novice
11751,It's the best first approach to the world of guitar
11752,Excellent course with lots of practical exercises.
11753,"Interesting course! Very useful information. But it's a little difficult to manage 3 writing tasks simultaneously, it would be good to warn students about big task at the end of the course."
11754,I learned a lot of things and information about health
11755,One of the West...!
11756,Some of the lectures could be a little more direct. Some of the examples/ exercises could could be more concise. Thanks!
11757,Great course for very beginners
11758,Very relevant in today's context.
11759,"I learnt about myself skill, how to identify and how to improve as well."
11760,The test difficulty was a lot easier than the actual course content.
11761,His course is very helpful to understand why some designer present certain information or things in a certain way.
11762,"a great course to start with, it is very simple and helpful i really enjoyed it clot, Or. Charles makes everything easy and fun, you will get to apply after each chapter that way you will improve clot and there is also Bonus video which i found so amazing because you get to know about new stuff but still related to programming."
11763,Really enjoyed the course and Jeff Weak's clear presentation. Feel ready and excited to go and learn even more about Data Science starting with R Programming
11764,I enjoyed this course. It gave a quick and thorough
11765,I definitely like Or. Severance's style and sense of humor! Thanks a lot!
11766,His course is excellent. It's my first course in course. I like professor Chuck very much. Really enjoy taking the lectures.
11767,Well information
11768,"I would give 4.5 stars but not full marks because I don't believe there is sufficient support for novice programme. More worked examples earlier on with MatLab would have been invaluable and the first week could have an easy programming project to establish the basis via practical experience rather than lecture.However, I found the material to be otherwise fascinating and inspiring in the potential power of Machine Learning to apply mathematical principles to ameliorate the human condition. His has confirmed the path I have chosen. Thank you."
11769,His module is great! I really appreciate and recommend it
11770,"Very enjoyable course! Emily and Parlor actually succeed in giving a more than useful overview about so many kinds of tasks, algorithms and concepts of machine learning in very short time (given the material to cover!). I really loved the topics of the hands on assignment.New to Python (I'm a R user most of the time) I also learned a lot about ""the other language"" of Data Science. Thanks a lot!"
11771,"Great course!Very well organized, and worked in a format where you would build as you learned and had several milestones for review.The one complaint I have is that the final asks for you to work in Tableaux, and provides you a license for 15 days, although the course runs longer than that."
11772,Very well designed. Sides were excellent. Reviews and programming exercises were very well thought through.
11773,"More challenging Problem sets, as in the R Programming course !"
11774,His is a wonderful course. Thank you very much and a Happy 2016.
11775,"A very complete course for understanding from the beginning Machine Learning and which are the different algorithms and tools you can work with. I strongly recommend it. Also, the programming tasks do really help to ground the concepts"
11776,"For a beginner, this course was a challenge in comparison to the other three base parts of Draft of Writing, but as a result of the challenge, it is by far the most rewarding as well.The concepts discussed, and the material provides the earners with both broad perspective into several topics that I would argue to be crucial in becoming a writer, and also a deep look at some very key concepts to writing.I would recommend taking this course last of the four, before beginning the Capstone project - if you're planning on going through all the parts. Of you're a more seasoned writer, I would recommend starting with this course, and seeing how you fare with it.I've enjoyed all of the base courses, but for me personally, this one struck the strongest chord."
11777,Shame that it was not possible to progress with this course without using graphlab which the creator of this course himself created. Please see the course as just a training sales promotion for his of application.
11778,"Thank you, Professor Andrew G for a great course on Machine Learning !!"
11779,Interesting content and very well designed course. Instructor is good at explaining concepts.
11780,Such a helpful course! It really helped inform my teaching practices to engage all of the students!
11781,good for learning.
11782,In-depth knowledge of social impact with relevant examples and handy tools and framework. The course provided structure to my approach towards social impact. Highly recommended.
11783,Great course that equip me with more effective learning tools.
11784,"The best course I've seen on Coursera! Wonderful lectures, amazing pictures and animation and all very engaging."
11785,Very helpful to understand the patron APIs to access the web data and how to pause the XML and JSON formats. The course presentation was friendly and easy to follow. The assignment were covering the patron in detail. Overall very useful and highly recommended.Thank you.
11786,Would be improved using musical video or complementary material. Is a little be boring just listening to lectures. :(
11787,Very nice introduction to bayesian concepts and rational. With this course I could understand why should I spend more time learning this technique (which I will definitely do on sequence).
11788,"Structures, easy to understand and clear. Advocates positive and value based approach to negotiations."
11789,Recent introduction course.Without the rest it is useless in my opinion.To only take in case you want to follow the entire learning path.
11790,"I have prior programming experience and have done a few courses on course. I found the course useful to gain a fair degree of proficient in html,iss & javascript. The course is not easy and needs a lot of work. The exercises are also thoughtfully designed to make you apply your skill. I did not upgrade and did the exercises myself without the benefit of a peer review"
11791,Very useful course! Depending on your background you may have to span it over two sessions.
11792,"Marvelous, as are all the courses in this specialization program!"
11793,Interesting and perspective course
11794,Well explained and motivate me to learn
11795,That a great course .. I really enjoy it .
11796,Great explanations from basis to more advanced knowledge. Vice work!
11797,"Very nice Glass .Reaches me a lot, as i am a boots"
11798,"I learned good materials for Python from this class. The assignment are good. Only one comment: the writing of the assignment can be very vague and at times it is hard to understand. Overall, I like the class."
11799,"Would have used a few more details on how to change to various other brushes (squares, circles, etc)."
11800,It's a good topic. However the quality of the lectures are pretty low. In my opinion people could learn the topic more efficiently by reading Stewart's book.
11801,Great course!
11802,"Vice course! Provides a good basis in understanding the Internet, where it originated from and how it works. Or. Severance is an excellent tutor and I really liked his video and denotes. He makes the material come to live."
11803,"His is a fantastic course! It gives a general, yet solid overview of machine learning theory and how to apply it in practice. It's one of the best courses I've taken in my career. Great work."
11804,"The course is very interesting and i like simply because it is very appropriate approach in this economic driven world to bethink about our planet and intimate a paradise shift in thinking. Is I am from small padlocked Himalayan country known as Human (country of Cross National Happiness), the course is very vital in achieving the objectives of our philosophical concept of GNH. The course is Excellent!"
11805,His is a great class. I enjoyed the video. I hope to see more classes on poultry in the future.
11806,Great overview about planning projects! Such better and objective than many presidential courses. Thanks
11807,"Pretty information course. I found some difficulties understanding some of the terms provided in this MOOC; thus, I think having more illustrated presentation would make it easier to follow along. Great efforts and a huge amount of ideas. Thank you so much."
11808,It's a good starting point. I've now got a good idea of what else I need to learn. The course also provides an easy to apply approach to get value from my efforts using data science.
11809,I very much enjoyed the challenge to use Tableaux to make a presentation and learned a lot while doing so.
11810,"I benefit a lot from this course.Most of details in this course are designed from practical perspective, so if you as a beginner want to learn of well, you are highly recommended to take all questions and programming assignment."
11811,In amazing course. It's enabling me to rest my learning abilities! Highly recommend it.
11812,"Very, very good lecturer. I learned a lot!"
11813,Everything you always wanted to know about « Now to learn » based on the most recent scientific discoveries in neuroscience and cognitive sciences. A must for every serious student!
11814,"I found that the course was an amazing beginning level course. Brian Inn was straight forward in what he was teaching us, and helped me get a good handle on Unity"
11815,Heart Course! Thanks Duke University
11816,Immensely enlightening. I'd recommend this course to anyone who loves languages and wants to explore the fascinating world of linguistic
11817,Easy and engaging and very helpful!
11818,"It was awesome making my own game from start to finish, using all the knowledge I learned throughout all the courses in this specialisation, and also, seeing all the great content and ideas created by my classmates :)"
11819,very interesting course！！！
11820,I think it's a very useful course to those who have any kind of business (since not being online it's impossible in our days). it gives you a complete understanding of how you should promote and construct your webster to conquer your target.
11821,"Great, great course - amazingly uplifting, insightful and thought provoking"
11822,It is amazing to learn how many different kinds of data exists and how to work with them using R. Wonderful course!
11823,Solid introduction. Not so engaging if using the non-paid option
11824,"I could give you 5 stars if you issue the Statement of Accomplishment to students who passed this course by free, at least... Anyway, the course was so great and interesting to me ! Thank you so my"
11825,pretty good and some
11826,Very useful course
11827,Very detailed and well covered
11828,"Vice introduction. I wasn't following the lectures that close, because the material was not that new to me, but the assignment and quires are amazing"
11829,Needs to be more engaging.
11830,The best nutrition course ever! Thank you very much Or.May Dam!
11831,Very information course! North every penny!
11832,Great course
11833,"I recommend it, fantastic course. You´ll need certain level of business experience and english to get the most out of it. It opened my horizons and provide me with needed skill!"
11834,Very useful to me. I learned all about lesson planting and designing.
11835,I still only partially through this course but I am very impressed. The professor is excellent; he brings humor into the lessons and explains everything in a way that we can understand. I also love the fact that he interviews various experts throughout the course in order to bring in even more perspective. His class is extremely interesting to me and beyond my expectations. Thanks to the professor and to Coursera!
11836,"His course is very complete in terms of vocabulary and helpful for people who haven't been in a hospital or clinic before to get and idea of how these settings work. The only thing I would have wished for this course to have a little more vocabulary is on diseases, conditions and procedures."
11837,His is absolutely a great course. The best I ever take on Coursera. I cannot figure out a better option as first machine learning course to whom wants to learn about.
11838,"The course content is highly challenging and that's great for a sense of accomplishment. The biological problems motivate the biologist to go through the abstract mathematical concepts(but I have to admit there is a threshold where the biologist can not get it well anymore(greedy motif, gibb ...) and I wonder if he does really need it to be practical with day to day problems with chip array see see...)be ready you will struggle hard here"
11839,Fire! Thanks!
11840,"Phenomena course! I had me exploring the ""why"" of my action plan from lesson 1!"
11841,By favorite in the specialization thus far
11842,"Simple, clean course that focused beautifully on the core of what is being taught.Also very enjoyable vice to the instructor and the assignment; there's a puppet as a of... enough said. :)"
11843,His is a great into course to Chinese! I would like to see the characters were written above the words as you learn to simply become familiar with some of the common characters. I am grateful for the access this course provides for those traveling to China to respectfully communicate and show interested in the Chinese culture.
11844,The class is very useful and clear!!
11845,"Structures Course that gives beginner to intermediate level expertise. Short course, so there is not much time to give challenging assignment that would prepare you for a job or industry level skill in this topic. The student enrollment was limited (compared to my other courses on Coursera) and hence the discussion forum was not active. There is no of or instructor participation in discussion forum; hence my advanced questions in forum (intended to learn beyond the course) went unanswered. You can learn this all on internet, but the instructor nicely covered 3 topics in 3 weeks, which is helpful."
11846,it gave more details than my class room. it also adopt a practical approach to learn. it is a great course in repression especially for practitioner.Thanks Parlor and Emily :)
11847,The course was a great learning experience in exploring ways to communicate professionally with anyone around the globe.
11848,By name is Rose Antonio. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career (http://www.linked.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this specialization to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructor.
11849,"Very interesting and insightful course. I enjoyed it.Assignment was okay, could have provided more challenge and depth though."
11850,Was good on the description and clearly mentioned in each point. Felt like time can be managed somehow.
11851,It is a wonderful course for professional working in different settings. It sharpen interpersonal skill and makes a person better leader.
11852,"I really enjoyed this course, I just learned great functinalyties from Cava Script and Pollen was a very good instructor in your classes!"
11853,Clear explanation on the language usage
11854,"His course is straightforward, and at the same time deep going. the reading and available books on the topic, enable considerable in depth study. I find the work load very reasonable, still I have the impression I have learnt a lot."
11855,"I think more detail statements are needed on PDF.Because I'm not good at listening, so I studied by PDF."
11856,A wonderfully thought out and executed course. Thank you to Or. Reverence for his excellent materials and guidance throughout the course.
11857,A great course. A complete overview of diabetes.
11858,it's so great.
11859,Concise but very clear and rich in exercises to immediately apply and cement the material
11860,It was indeed a very great learning experience. His course help me change my learning patterns effectively. Everybody must have this course to learn things better way.
11861,"Great introductory course to data structures in Python. Course materials consist of short video's explain key topics, followed by quires, assignment and assignment walk through video."
11862,"Awesome course! I really liked it a lot, it has been very useful!"
11863,Great course!
11864,"It is a very good and intensive course of project management. Some pieces of information have been provided little bit called, which made me make mistakes in quires. However I enjoyed all the stuff. Thanks a lot!"
11865,May is a great Teacher..!!!I´m really happy with my new knowledge about health and food.Regards From Colombia
11866,Rough but awesome.
11867,Highly recommended!
11868,Excellently presented course. Very information. Some really good recommended links to read along side the course context. Well thought out.
11869,"I really like this course. I was able to learn several useful concepts to retrieve data from the web. I like the assignment, there are needed to practice and see the potential use of the material class. Lectures are very easy to follow with several examples that help you to remember previous concepts. Maybe I would like to see more examples!"
11870,"Very nice and comprehensive, thank you!"
11871,Very interesting and helpful course! Thank you!
11872,Disorganized.
11873,"its original,very insightful,and education,above all content is evidence"
11874,"It's very good for beginners who want to learn machine learning. Thank you, Andrew G!"
11875,"Very good course! I noticed some of the instructions are out of date (e.g. there are examples of where to go on the webster, but the webster format has changed). I wish I understood more of what sat and the IDE were doing behind the scenes. It seems like there is a lot of structure built into making the assignment function properly and I would like to better understand how to make my own project with similar level of complexity / capabilities."
11876,Great teaching!
11877,His course has helped me be better prepared for my coming trip to Soul. I think I will be able to navigable around town a little bit better now!
11878,Very good course. Awesome content.
11879,Vice course to start with. I think this course is good for beginner
11880,"""All you need to know about Machine Learning but didn't know whom to ask"". Wonderful course! The quires and exercises are very well put together."
11881,Professor Chuck is very humorous. It is strongly recommended to those who have zero prior experience on programming. It is fun and easy.
11882,"His course is really interesting and very useful, if interested in Data Analysis. But even if you're not pursuing a career in Data Analysis, still the knowledge you acquire is very practical and may come in handy."
11883,"I really like the company narratives. For this very overview presentation, it would be helpful to see more of these."
11884,For the third Course in the Python specialisation this is a very basic 6 weeks. The assignment are repetition and you are pretty much spoon fed everything. Of you are looking for a challenging course this is not for you!
11885,"I love how this course delve into a very promising advanced research topic in Computational Complexity. It helps me a lot to understand treading publications in the area. Specially that the material is presented in an incremental approach. His way a researcher can live through the evolution of ideas. It is inspiring also in the way one comes up with a partial solution for the special case, and then generalized with approximation factor that is satisfying good. I'm looking forward to more advanced courses in parameterized, streaming or quantum algorithms."
11886,Great course. well presented
11887,Great course! The course content is very good and the length is appropriated.
11888,Very sufficient course. Pollen is a great teacher!
11889,Really useful class
11890,In excellent course for those who interested to acquire a basement in the field of robotics
11891,"His was one of the most thought-provoking and useful courses I have taken. The professor deftly wove together aesthetic issues with technical ones, which was really refreshing given the topic focus on the technical aspects of music in some other Coursera courses. Projects were well-designed. I feel more confident working with DAW's, MIDI, and musical coming after having taken this course."
11892,I love this course
11893,"His course did not make any effort until I had to dig deep into biology by myself. The course content is insufficient. I think if a sample input was used and every field of the input were explained and also the output were explained then it would make much more sense. Poorly designed and demonstrated. Thankfully I started the last assignment very quickly, it took me 10 days to understand how to proceed with the assignment. The of is excellent, without his help I wouldn't pass this course."
11894,The material was enough to take one from basis to the advanced level of accounting.
11895,Difficult as hell.When You complete it You really start understanding this area but I think due to level of difficulty teaching staff should be a little more active.Fig difference in difficulty in lessons(which are easy)and test(which are sometimes incredibly difficult).Of You want to work in Fig Data field You HAVE of complete this course but...expect hell.
11896,One of the best course !!
11897,It is really a good course. I learnt a lot. And I will learn the further courses.
11898,Excellent course ! I have learned a lot.
11899,"The best Teacher's Course I've ever seen! Prof.Dixon literally radiates energy, contentment, and inspiration - I felt so much inspiration and eagerness I never had before!Knoll, and you would never regret. Not a second, believe me."
11900,"In awesome beginning to the world of Machine Learning. It was as challenging as it was mind-blowing to learn how to actually perform machine learning thought the course.Any, many thanks to Andrew G!"
11901,His course relief heavily on self-reading and theoretical knowledge. Video interviews which are part of the curriculum are mostly not useful. Overall the course did not provide me with the value I was looking for.
11902,"To far a very nice course, well explained and clear enough to be followed even by non mathematicians. Well done!"
11903,this course is wonderful
11904,it is great
11905,Great course !
11906,"His course it is so good. It help me to think much better than before. I learned to learn much better with the tools that Barbara Valley and Or. Terence Sejnowski showed in the course. Now, I will try to keep this idea about learn."
11907,His course open my eyes for the of world!! very well done!
11908,"I like this course very much , it provides us some introduction to the financial market. I completed this course on 15 February 2016. Highly recommended !One the other hand, I feel proud because this is the first batch of this course offering and specifically related to investment management specialization. I'm committed to follow this specialization until completing the capstone project.Thank you very much.Than"
11909,this course is comprehensive and very useful. thank you course
11910,"Initially it was a bit challenging with all the baths, but after understanding the basic concepts it was really exciting to continue the course and complete it."
11911,Wonderful course! The material discussed is applicable in all kinds of scenario not just crisis!
11912,"Or. Severance put in lot of efforts to make patron easy for all the earners.His Course is about the basis of patron. Of you are a beginner, you will learn a lot of concepts very easily. For people who have a bit of programming knowledge in other languages, this will help in learning the santa.Overall a good course to go through."
11913,Great way to start!
11914,thank you dr whitman
11915,Very good! easy to understand!
11916,By favorite course ever! I think everyone should spend 6 weeks studying this! It can benefit EVERYONE!!! =D
11917,"I you are absolutely new to SQL, I couldn't recommend a better course. Its a wonderful course to take, good explanations and excellent practice opportunities with real database. The program goes beyond just writing SQL queried but help you to understand the way database are organized, and it reaches you how to right queried from an analytical perspective."
11918,"The content is great. But there's not a lot of activity on the discussion boards, and there are some technical issues with the quires (using future lesson material on current quires). But the content is really fascinating."
11919,"The entire specialization was a wonderful experience. I learned a lot about photography, and about project planning. The course also helped me to build confidence and not get so hung up on trying to be perfect right from the gate. Vice people taking photography from all over the world and fun, too. Thank you."
11920,A great course and a brilliant teacher. Covers a wide but relevant set of topics and acts as a practical guide for managing time and working smarter. Thank you.
11921,great course to learn.
11922,"Very comprehensive as an introductory course. The content is very actual and the lectures' flow is objective. Also, I liked the quit inside the lectures as they helped in retain the subject. I have some hard difficulties with the mathematics as I'm very rusty with the mathematics (more than 30 years of rust). I'm from the compute science area so I would like to see more practice in algorithms. However, I would like to congratulate the Stanford University and Cousera tears for the course. Great job."
11923,Very helpful. I liked the way Andrew taught us the concepts.
11924,"The course has been really good and valuable. The first 3 nodules have been outstanding and I reckon the th one could be much more simple and interesting. Overall, it's a great content and thoroughly knowledgeable. Any affiliation of Coursera with employer community would greatly inspire students too. Thank you Coursera and ISB for all the support and help in bringing this course."
11925,Good material!
11926,"I enjoyed the information, although the typography section was a bit brief. The course does help myself and others to get an idea of what an actual on-site course might consist of. I have been wanting to take a type/entering class at my current school but have had the chance. Course was mostly information and taught me ways to research and design."
11927,Highly recommend it to do it if you love Canada and its Mountains!
11928,Easy to follow and with clear exercises
11929,It is very useful and practical
11930,Great course and great teacher
11931,"His course is good, but maybe it is a little bit to easy and only cover a small part of knowledge. However, I think it's okay for a introduction course. I hope there will be course dig into more deeply and wider knowledge"
11932,Perfect course!
11933,Excellent lecture material and course an amazing instructor as well.Thanks to Or. Chuck and the Coursera team!
11934,"His course is very useful, the foundament topics of GIS allows us to think about all the possibilities that we can represent specially, and the chance of automatization of this."
11935,"I enjoy this course,because i find a lot of useful advises"
11936,"His course is very inconsistent when it comes to JavaScript. Instead of giving fundamentals of the language, course instructor prefer to give you a bunch of non-standard libraries and teach you a couple of random selected methods which could be applied to images. All core concepts such as data types, data structures are explained very sketch. OOP paradise isn;t explained at all. For example, they give you a line of code which goes something like:war x = new SimpleImage(""..."");no explanation of what SimpleImage is is given neither you are taught how exactly it works. Apparently, this course relief heavily on self-learning the limb docs given on their site.All together this leads you to simply monkey-coming lecture materials into code editor without even realising how it works and what it does. His course is at best serve conservatory purpose to give student just a week at what web development is like.His course could not be used as a solid foundation for specialization."
11937,"Well-structures course, Or. Vienna and his fellow team-members are passionate in what they do, and that's evident during the course, but I can't help to think that they have barely scratched the surface here... The lectures are good, they provide a lot of information, but the quires offer no challenge whatsoever. That was somewhat disappointing, it felt like I was cheating. All in all, I don't regret buying and completing the course, but I really hope that Or. Vienna's team will be back soon with a more challenging and advanced course."
11938,Great introduction to Same Theory !!!!
11939,Vice lectures. Projects are very interesting.
11940,Perfect and Useful Course so far
11941,"Vice, professional, low emphasis on programming aspect, high focus on practice. Lots of explanations, tutorials, free code samples and explanations are provided."
11942,"A waste of money. Only $50, but it was so terrible I did not even want to finish it. And apparently I waited too long to get a refund as well. Never again."
11943,very low length to content ratio; basic content
11944,Amazing presentation. Good content
11945,A perfect beginner's introduction course to the Fig Data World.
11946,Moved it. To much valuable information.
11947,His course is very awesome. Professor's conventional way of explaining the concepts really helped me learn some of the tough concepts. I really enjoyed Calculus for the first time :)
11948,poorly done
11949,Great...
11950,"The course is very information and useful if you are newly introducing yourself to web development.And the instructor is just awesome! He makes the course very interesting, deserves 5 stars."
11951,It's a good introductory course!
11952,Great instructor
11953,"Course has not been updated. Wrong answers in quit (eg week 3 quit on progressivism), video getting blocked at review question point, etc. I am checking out."
11954,A course that changes the way of seeing the history
11955,very cool !!!
11956,"I really enjoyed this course. It was fabulous/All materials were amusing good, interesting and helpful.Thanks so much."
11957,Help me improve my knowledge of how to learn and now I can learn many things more faster than before. I love this course.
11958,"A very wonderful follow up to the first course in this specialization. Each topic is presented in a way that is clear to understand. Assignment increase slightly in difficulty, but are still very do-able. And the granulation ceremony at the end is a nice touch as well. Overall, very satisfied with this specialization so far. Feel like I've got a good handle on fundamental programming concepts now, and am excited to continue on to the next course! Thanks so much to everyone who makes these courses possible!"
11959,It's really useful!
11960,A wonderful course to study! Prof. Brian Jaffa explains so well!
11961,"Interactivity with JavaScript was too quick and short. JavaScript by nature is much more complicated than HTML5 and CSS3, and therefore I believe that it should be done in a bit more than 4 weeks, and broken down in to smaller bits of the basic into required to get a grasp on the materials. For example, the first assignment had too much in it for a beginner, and a bit more homework, in smaller bits of the code prior to the assignment could have make a huge difference for the better."
11962,I loved not only the content but how it was delivered. Is the first time I learned without reading almost anything.THANK YOU!!!!
11963,"It this point, I am excited and completely satisfied :)"
11964,Very useful and easy to follow.
11965,His is a great place to start programming!
11966,The arguments are really interesting and even quite well explained.In my opinion however it should be focused on less topics in order to gain practical skill: there are too much arguments and none of them seems to be explained in depth.
11967,Basis taught in a very clear & simple way. Thank you!
11968,"Though I have worked in MNC with and people across the globe, learning the theoretical aspects of business helps you understand the process better and hence improve your work.West Wishes."
11969,His course has a good logical approach.
11970,"I have taken many courses, but this one is really useful and knowledgeable."
11971,Wonderful learning opportunities
11972,great course! thanks a lot!
11973,"Very good course. I liked the fluttering examples. They were a little bit detached from the rest, but they were also great."
11974,His course is super interesting and the professor is amazing.
11975,Great course~!
11976,老师讲得很好。虽然课程中用到的是Python2，我自己用的Python3，但是对照课本，完成作业没有问题。讲到XML和JSON那里，感觉有点难懂，下一门课要上一下Internet History，technology and Security。谢谢老师。
11977,very useful
11978,His is great.
11979,Very interesting!!!!! thanks very much for sharing all this knowledge!!
11980,Love it.
11981,His course has mad me look at the Bible in a completely new and exciting way.
11982,"Overall it's a good into if you know nothing or very little about those topics.That said, the class is too slow.Homework is too easy and boring. It's all about following very specific (long) instructions - ""put this line of of here"", ""create a function called Too"", etc.Trading is done by peers, even though it could be automatic. Participation requires running arbitrary of written by other students."
11983,Some more information regarding the HTML attributes like area controls would have been good.
11984,Very interesting and enriching course. It gave me more than what I expected. Definitely a must for young negotiator
11985,Good starting course
11986,The professor was extremely didactic - breaking down the content into comprehensive pieces and choosing the right moment to present new information or avoid complications. Great course for those who want an overall introduction into the field of Machine Learning.
11987,Very well prepared and presented. I really had fun while auditing this course. Thank you!
11988,v good and I learn v easy
11989,His course is some!
11990,Its a good opportunity to learn latest technologies.And resources that you are providing to learn are really good
11991,"His is a great course for a patron beginner, the instructor is super enthusiastic about the course and the material which is definitely passed to students and makes it easy to understand the explanation. I would definitely recommend this course to a friend."
11992,Great Course. Very information.
11993,"I wrote my opinion in a previous comment, but I forget give you 5 starts"
11994,Wonderful teacher. Easy to follow along. Course is extremely flexible to go at your own pace
11995,Am lahcene find this courses before begin it very nice so would to focused it with learning much timesBest RegardsLahcene
11996,"an excellent course to understand Epidemic, Pandemics and outbreaks, which helps to get better public health understanding"
11997,"That's my first course on Coursera, i couldn't even imagine how interesting it would be!"
11998,"His operation of the course (August-September 2016) filled because so few students were actively participating. Early in the course, I worked diligently on my written contributions to the discussion forms, but then there was so little peer response that I gradually came to understand that I was mostly just talking to myself. Halfway through the course, I gave up on the forms.But I read all the poems, viewed the video and took the quires. The quires are lame, the poetry selection is great, and the video lectures are all worthwhile.I had initial misgivings about some of the video. The improvised round-table discussions of met-poems by Dickinson, Stevens and Sullen (module 4, lesson 4) initially seemed too colloquies and not incisive, but then I realized they had value as models for how to rope into an initial understanding of a strange poem. The lecture on Part Crane (module 1, lesson 4) was too difficult for me to follow in real-time spoken form, but then I found I could understand some of it by frequently stopping and starting the video, re-reading the lecture text in transcribe, and taking long breaks for careful review of Crane's verse and for research about some of its allusions and associations. That lecture might have made more sense in purely written form, and I wonder if it was so dancing that it scared off some of the students who started the course.Is a whole, the course managed a satisfying balance between discussion of the poetry itself and discussion of the social and economic contents in which the poetry was created and consumed. I especially appreciated the clarity of Aren Word's many lectures and Him Newcomb's lively and enthusiastic investigation of the role of little magazines in the 1910s & 1920s."
11999,"Maybe too easy for some people, but is ok to ensure a minimum level in order to knoll other courses in the specialization."
12000,"The course covers basis brilliantly but may be a little too fast in its pace with more focus on ""suggest"" of knowhow rather than explaining theories. Perhaps would be nicer to understand the different kinds of markets with more real life examples that go into detail one level higher."
12001,It's old
12002,Truly great. These technique can and will be utilized for years to come.
12003,"Friendly, fun, clear and helpful.I loved it."
12004,Great perspective and multiple technique.
12005,Need to download the reading lessons for office reading
12006,Excellent class for Ruby beginner and can be applicable to any other language that use as of like Chef or Puppet as a requirement.
12007,Great course!
12008,Excellent course for beginners! Great prof! Really funny and knowledgeable :D
12009,"Information stray between ridiculously shallow and unnecessarily deep (e.g. the stuff about GPCRs is so far removed from importance when discussing addition). Most of the time the questions are poorly worded and thoughtless, and the whole thing reminds me of a bad high school class. Some parts border on misinformation, does seem almost as if it's been underwritten by the DEA. Saints a very distinct picture, a picture with an agenda and really incomplete portray of addition. Joints for trying though."
12010,"Will never look at plants the same again.Fascinating course, great lecturer, easily understood, great delivery"
12011,Very good. Practical information.
12012,That can you say? In amazing survey course on Machine Learning technique... by a master.
12013,Some questions confusing (with less than 5 so missing 1 was a fail) and a few video were lacking written summarise. Other than that not bad
12014,I really appreciate the content of this course and will like to thank prof. Grossman and Coursera team for providing me an opportunity to learn.
12015,"The materials provided are awesome, but the peer grade system does not work properly given that not everybody commits to giving feedback."
12016,I expected more extensive courseworks. Did not involve me in a lot of courseworks. I learnt a lot but got to implement very few.Weeks assignment was good.
12017,"I liked the course a lot since it is actually covering most of the things related to the package development. Nevertheless, I still feel (the same as with the previous classes) that authors could have spent more time building the course materials as many chapters are very brief and if I hadn't had the past experience with some of the topics, I wouldn't have any idea what the course is telling me (e.g. merge conflicts in git)."
12018,His gave an opportunity to present a product and show how easy it is to start preparing to launch your own started!
12019,Really liked this course! It is very well-organized and information. Would love to recommend to anyone who wants to learn more scientific and productive ways of learning.
12020,"All concepts are explained comprehensible and there are also bunch of good examples for each concept. I really enjoy the laws, which let me to build something cool on my own using my fresh knowledge."
12021,very information with practical input.
12022,His is really interesting and necessary course to understand data science
12023,"Easier to understand network structure, utilities, equilibrium after illustration. Interesting and attracting course to take."
12024,"Excellent guided meditations and a very well organized and well presented overview of the Lesser Vehicle of Tibetan Buddhist Meditation. The layout of the course was particularly good; with a theme each week and a set of lectures exploring the practice in question from a cultural and spiritual viewpoint, a set touching on the scientific aspect of the practice, a set outlining the history of the practice, and a series of guided meditations."
12025,The content is good. Needs better maintenance. Certain bags and assignment errors should be rectified.
12026,"It took me a few video before I started to connect with this course but in the end I really loved it. The processes Laura walks you through to consider why you give, what you'll give, how much and to whom are very valuable. It's a great toolkit for giving with intention and impact!"
12027,"His course accomplished both interests and benefits, which can be really hard. I really enjoyed the class and want to express my appreciation for all the lectures."
12028,pretty good course that generally covers the topics we but lacks depth
12029,thanks
12030,Course is very well organized with solid projects.
12031,"Challenging, thorough and engaging. Repetitive in a good way, by gently going back over content you almost learn by default. The quires are professionally prepared and sometimes tough to pass! His is good as you are obliged to think hard, even go back through materials or ask others for advice until the knowledge sticks. Highly recommended and of great practical value."
12032,A good way to learn the basis of web pages programming.
12033,Is most other parts of this specialization this course was excellent.
12034,Exceeded my expectations! Great course and I plan on taking the rest of the courses in the Specialization.
12035,WOW! funny to do and great stuff to know!
12036,A well-organized control course. The lectures are humorous. The documents are well-prepared. One of the best thing is I can apply the theory introduced in every lecture in the stimulation part to see how my root moves.
12037,A very good course for beginners :)
12038,Excellent instructor and great explanations.
12039,Humorous professor is a must to a wonderful class！ Thank you~
12040,"Liked the way course is organized, losing questions at the beginning of each lecture is a great idea."
12041,"Without question the content is great, but the written assignment instructions were somewhat vague and did not match the peer review public at times (although the enter did pin a few posts to address the problem)."
12042,"Instructor's presentation keeps the participant's attention. Connections are made to history, musicians and the trajectory of music. Must wishing all this could have been fearlessly integrated with soundbites and/or music video. There's gutta be a way around rights, residual and academic. Still, both courses taken together were engaging and information packed."
12043,"The best course ever. I never got to code anything before, but dr. Chuck is just brilliant in explaining complicated things in easiest way possible! Cheers!"
12044,Good Informative..
12045,"Great course! I love the instructor, they go at just the right pace and the content was rather fun. Highly recommended."
12046,very nice beginner level course and gives you a lot of knowledge
12047,Great course!!!! I love MeteorJS
12048,stimulated.
12049,"There was interesting information in the class, but the peer review questions were not well developed to stimulate thought and new ideas. Any of the answers I read were just repetition of what was learned in class. I think the objectives and expectations could have been more clearly communicated and the statement themselves better thought out. I also did not find the peer review process to be that productive as a trading tool. The parameter for trading were extremely simple and the feed back was quite subjective from students that did not understand the assignment.While I learned some useful information, I won't continue with this course."
12050,"Only very very basis. They won't teach you make well formed HTML documents, complete CSS files or learn to program in JavaScript."
12051,"Once again an excellent course, thank you!"
12052,very helpful if you do practice which l lack of .
12053,SUPER GREAT Course !!!!Thank you Or. Steve!!
12054,lots of mathematics and it's challenging
12055,course was pretty good and beneficial.
12056,His is a fun class and it is nice to start gaining control of the camera.
12057,"I am still a student under this course but i am all starting to get happy and happy about myself and my life day by day, this course is the best and i recommend it to everyone who want to lead a happy and lovely life , we all have problems in our life ,but its always good to be happy from small things that gives us happiness everyday."
12058,"The professor is the best one, explain everything in details making easy to understand the concepts."
12059,It's very useful for me!
12060,"His course has helped me on different levels. I improved my self awareness. That is the biggest improvement. Also, I am better listener. To far I saw a lot of improvement in my personal and professional life."
12061,"Scott E is wonderful to learn from! Very exciting and interesting material, worth taking the deep dive!"
12062,Great class with good explanations!
12063,Excellent!!! Very clear and easy to follow.
12064,is excellent!! great teacher
12065,Course is very friendly for beginners!
12066,"His course is perfect for states. I've learnt some Cava and C++ before, but I discovered some fun and useful ideas in this regained's course. Thanks to Fro. Severance, again I find programming easy and interesting."
12067,"I thought this was an excellent course. I found it challenging and had to re-read lecture notes and work through examples in order to be able to complete the assignment, but I felt that I learned a lot about both Scala and functional programming. By only criticism is that the set section is unclear. I ended up using Ellipse and did not use IntellJ at all, yet the set is unclear on this. Also there is a point when using Ellipse and importing a project where you have to type $ sat Ellipse and if you get this wrong then you are stuck! To if you get stuck - go to the Discussion pages."
12068,Lots to learn and it's fun to learn from different teachers. Very heavy (and high quality) course if one wants to do proper justice to all the materials presented (especially washing and trees... Week 3 onwards). A worthy investment . Enjoyed it immensely.
12069,Great course! Amazing teacher. The pace of course is convenient.
12070,"A great, eye-opening and education experience."
12071,"I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Python from scratch. I was new to programming and this course has helped me think like a programme. Even though I paused halfway through the course for a lengthy period, I was able to return to it and complete it successfully. I will be continuing on to do the second part of the course because the tutor has superior teaching skill. I've now started learning C programming through a weekly evening class and I'm finding it quite easy."
12072,Not overcomplicated and very information. No
12073,His is a great introduction to the brain and how we take in information--and put it together. Very clear and accessible but never boring. Highly recommended to anyone who's trying to understand how to more effectively to learn--and create.
12074,Great content and e
12075,Great course.
12076,Heavy going! Informative though - and an engaging teacher.
12077,"It was very good.. useful, creative and made me different"
12078,I loved this course. It was full of great ideas and amazing recipe that I shared with my friends. Thank you
12079,Very good teacher. Is clear in her speech and in visual aids as well.
12080,Sinus 3 stars for 3 complaints. Infographics for Journalism might be a better title. The trading guideline for the project see all specific to one type of publishing.2. Trades assigned by fellow classmates are very subjective and sometimes miss the points made it the material.3. Some of the class material is posted on YouTube and has advertising. I didn't buy into the class so I could watch as!
12081,"I looked forward to each week's newly posted lectures and other content. His is a well-organized course, and one learns the various principles, including the more technical, without much effort. Also, Or. Have Dixon is a gifted teacher: his success at teaching this class proves that the teaching methods he presents yields successful learning indeed. A recommended course!"
12082,"Via historical view, it's very comfortable to remember the economic principles."
12083,I'd give it a 5 if I was only rating the material- it was very information and easily digestive. Must what you need for a starting course.The assignment and scoring part of the course is what brings the rating down a notch. Relying solely on feedback from people who are probably beginners in the field and who go by one sentence instruction on what to feedback on was not always constructive. More guidance needs to be added to what to look out for when scoring somebody's work.
12084,"Although the name of the course is a bit misleading, the content it covers is good and is worth the price you pay for it. Instructor is very information and knows what he's talking about. Quizzes and assignment are a bit easy for my taste but that a minor grip."
12085,Some themes are shown very superficially it would be great to go deeper. Despite of this the course is great!Thanks.
12086,should know
12087,"Great course, really information"
12088,"Great content. Reaching style could be improved for the medium. A couple of errors that should be rectified. The course seems poorly maintained. It is pity because it is content really valuable and ""hot""."
12089,Very interesting!
12090,"Great walkthrough guidance , learned clot!"
12091,Very good course on Boostrap. It was great to have an introduction to this framework. The teachers did a good job in explaining the concepts. The video and the materials are very good.It would be great to have a follow-up course to learn more advanced stuff.
12092,Too easy and full of straw (meaning thing not needed)
12093,"Great lectures, great material, great course."
12094,Great real world example of technology changing Was of marketing.
12095,"A very detailed course about writing a systematic review, still helped me to gain better understanding while reading one as a clinical."
12096,"Vice course, but too much focus on ""R"" as a tool.... Industries don't use R as much... The course must be made more genetic and independent of R - understand it is not easy to do but ...."
12097,Great introduction to human-centered design conceptual applicable across multiple discipline.
12098,"Hard, but worthwhile. Sides are outstanding. Textbook is very good. Examples are also outstanding."
12099,Great course.
12100,"A great overview, not any real depth, some practice examples would be nice. Good for those who have never done of at all as a prime."
12101,"Thorough, in-depth, and extremely useful! I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning or refreshing their knowledge of machine learning."
12102,"The professor is amazing. He has the ability to present the material very clearly, concise, and with a good dose of humour! I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in algorithms and data structures as an undergraduate or a professional."
12103,Moved it.. now I know.. can wait to implement things in my start-up and build some cool stuff.
12104,Or. Chuck is awesome. He makes that hard and difficult technical stuff really recognisable.
12105,The best horses for beginners!
12106,"Of you work with data this is an excellent course, but even if you are not a frequent data user you can learn a lot from the logic it explains. I absolutely recommend it."
12107,Excellent lecture material with excellent lecturer. Easy to understand and interesting to listen.
12108,"Excellent, interactive course! I enjoyed the assignment (both writing and reviewing of peers work). The quires were not obvious and did not require simple regurgitation of into but actual thinking! I found the lessons on DBI, PWYW and Choice Engines very interesting. Well done Uric and crew, your passion for marketing comes through in the lectures."
12109,"Honestly, this course was very simple and say to understand but very useful to improve my ability in writing."
12110,"Great course, help me a lot about the concepts about web-developing,"
12111,"Excellent introductory course. The programming exercises were all interesting and helpful, actually, I think the course could include more programming exercises and video quires."
12112,Too many bags with Coursera. Issues occur with submission. System indicates submission were successfully submitted. When when you log back in it indicates your assignment is over due. Now I can't
12113,It helped me understand why multitasking is doing no good to my career.
12114,"Excellent Course, calcified a lot of misinformation I've had about the business area of music. Learned several things during the copyright week. All weeks were fantastic."
12115,I had a great time learning . It was fun as well as information. Maybe we can have a story competition in another of your courses.
12116,"His information was new to me. With a lot of work to watch and reach the lectures, I learned A LOT. I had to red the homework for two separate weeks because I have no background in this field. I found it helpful to grade many more than the required homework assignment because then I learned from my other classmates. It was a challenging class but also interesting. I'm very excited to take the next class in the specialization, Aruduino and C Programming."
12117,"It's a good course, In the last lesson miss more examples."
12118,Great continuation of the material in Into to HTML5. Allows a quick and efficient grasp of CSS fundamentals. Highly positive and responsive professor and staff.
12119,I would like to recommend this class for every language teacher. The class is amazing!
12120,Excellent. Very complete and didactic
12121,Great course. the teacher makes patron really easy to understand and also speaks in a way that is easy for foreign people to understand as well.
12122,"I understand peer review is a bit difficult, but being quit only made this course a bit too easy. Pollen is a great teacher though and I like her unique teaching style and viewpoint."
12123,A good solution to begin with method. Any features illustrated in short video.
12124,His is a great series. Stay with it all the way through!
12125,"Lots of great reference information available in this course that is constantly being updated. The course forces you to finish your project so at the end of the course you have something done which is a 16 panel comic. Going a cover for your small comic book is optional.It was fun to do for me. I'd give it 4.5 stars if it would allow such scoring. By only complaint is that the course seemed rushed and too short for all that you need to cover and create in some weeks.I still would not hesitate to recommend this course because it is complete. All that is necessary is some very basic supplies. Photoshop may be needed to complete the final week, but I worked around that issue as I think some others in the course may have done as well."
12126,"Whether you have never studied grammar and punctuation, or you need to brush up on your previous knowledge, this course is perfect to learn quickly and precisely. You get just enough theory and plenty of practice."
12127,it is very good but needs some more explanation and suppurative materials other than video to get more knowledge
12128,"Excellent, well organised and well taught."
12129,"Easy to follow, it is very helpful to learn basic knowledge to use with an arguing board. I recommend it"
12130,Not the best one on course. Included many details that are not really relevant and quires just checked if you memories it.
12131,Very good course! The only problem for me was the poor quality of the sound.
12132,Great for learning the basis and the proper way to do things!
12133,A great course if you want to learn some basis in machine learning and where/how it can be applied.
12134,"I really like this course, really! Thanks to Professor Think, thanks to course for offering such a great platform for us to learn and to improve myself!"
12135,"Exceptional. Fascinating topic, right level of depth, excellent professor - both in competence and teaching skill."
12136,It is really useful class.
12137,LOVE this course! Am going to suggest to all my students and clients that they take this course!Nurse Journey
12138,"Run and interesting. On't remember all the ways to get and clean data, but it's good to review them so I know what's possible."
12139,I really enjoyed this course and the way art was discussed based on theme rather than chronological. By only issues with the class were the frustration with the quires being grade incorrectly.
12140,"His is a fantastic course. It has greatly kindled my interest in cryptography, and I look forward to learning more on the subject from Prof An One."
12141,Very good course.. I learned much!Thank you for this opportunities
12142,Simple and to the point. I recommend this class to any data scientist or manager planning to supervise a data science team or plan projects based on data analysis. His class would make an excellent review for early the students in any science field.
12143,Really great. A big thanks to the professor for the big effort and clarity of explanations
12144,Good Into to R.Basis of ggplot2 should have been covered along with base graph or as a separate unit
12145,some problems in quit part are confusing... but nice course in general
12146,"Great class, broken down into quick lectures that you can do during a commune!"
12147,Beautiful mixed and executed.
12148,Great course. The coursework outlines and explains the details of private equity and venture capital. Fundamental principles and concepts were clear and digestive. The lecture video and PowerPoint are signed and very clear. It is a well-constructed and most valuable course. Highly recommended!
12149,"Professor Lipschitz is an amazing lecturer. Is a professional archeologist who focused on of prehistoric societies during my graduate studies, I find this class fascinating. The ability to tie archeology to history through written documents is an approach that works quite well. Professor Lipschitz’ use of maps in the lectures really helps to follow the battles and takeover throughout the Fertile Crescent. I also have to recognize the excellent lecture that Professor When presented on the Babylonian Chronicles. I hope at some point, Professor When is able to present a full class on Assyriology. I will also sign up for any additional courses taught by Professor Lipschitz."
12150,Teacher is very good and makes learning programming interesting and fun to learn.
12151,"His was both a fun and interesting course, I am looking forward to Principles of game design."
12152,A great way to learn and practice javascript. Great course for beginneer and great practice for a seasoned programme.
12153,"Very Good Course, Professor is very clear and Motivate."
12154,I can't find my results
12155,thank you
12156,"The teacher was rather information, he analyzed the subject to its detail i am very satisfied."
12157,Great course.
12158,"very useful course,as a beginner, this helped me a lot to learn this language"
12159,"It is hard to be constructive when you do have something brilliant to compare with.The very first thing to say is that the course is presented through poorly drawn cartoons for 5-year-old and ineffective lecture video with little or no eye contact with the instructor. The presentations are filled with strange icons and drawings appearing every here and there, making not much of a professional impression.After watching video, in just about 5 minutes after the lecture is over, the retained information was always going to zero. Sometimes I had to remind the video to retrieve the points they were trying to make. Or maybe I just didn't want to listen to them. But it seems impossible due to the fact I am interested, and I do finish every course on Business writing I run into. Always with 100% final grade.The overall demeanour is not as professional as it has to be. I recommend the designer to watch ""Write Professional Mails"" with Merry Wanders by Georgia Lech and ""Each English Now!"" with Or. Have Dixon by Arizona State University. I do not normally remember the instructor' names, except for brilliant ones. I do not remember the ones of this course.I do hope my criticism will eventually lead to a better experience for your students. I apologize if I was overlay direct and wordy.Regards,Rafael"
12160,corporate of focused conflict NON resolution.
12161,"A fine overview of many things , Good in terms of knowledge."
12162,Clear and useful
12163,Good historical overview. I especially liked the 'case studies' of the various European countries during the was. The literature part included some very good reading and interesting moves. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the topic o
12164,His is so wonderful but i wish i would receive the printed copy of the certificate by post too.
12165,The course covers very limited sunset of plots and mostly tormented to R-specific technical routine rather than overall approaches. Case-study example is helpful and contrary to the most comments I do appreciate the final course project: this how most problems are stated in real life. Of you would like to cover more fundamental concepts behind exploratory analysis I would recommend other sources.
12166,"It is most useful course here i have joined I got a lot of information from, with high Efficiency!thanks at all!"
12167,Easy to understand and follow. Especially appreciate the importance put on inaccessibility.
12168,Thank you for giving me excellent information on psychological system.It is very helpful course for me. Thank you University of Western Australia and Coursera.
12169,Very lovely one. It helps a lot.
12170,Great course
12171,The auto-traders provide lots of detailed feedback and make working on the assignment a very positive part of the course.
12172,Great course
12173,Great very easy to follow and good video and sound
12174,"I found this course to be very useful, it offered me a solid start in programmingthank you very much !"
12175,"His course is very explanatory and it has many practical life scenario, which we are not exposed in college (here in india). Thank you very much for this course."
12176,"REALY solid information in this course are given, great topics allocation and schelling, definitely the best online course in this field."
12177,Great course with insight into Social Media Marketing!
12178,very good course!!
12179,"Great idea but professional design and programming.Looks like nobody double-checked it before starts to offer it, especially for money.Almost every Ruin and separate questions has programming bags.Waiting for ver 2 ASAP."
12180,"It would be nice with more than [Red the HVAC teach] to clear things up, he is hard to relate to if you have another kind of software you want to develop.Otherwise i really like the methods and the video, the teacher is easy to understand, he has good points and is good at explaining his material."
12181,"Awesome, fun and insightful!"
12182,"It is a great effort to try to explain writing an academic paper. I appreciate it. And unfortunately, these guns have an awful English accent. It is almost impossible to understand. Moreover, their sentences are so long and complicated that makes it impossible to get it. Vice try but it doesn't work :(West regards,Or. Urban"
12183,"Enjoyed this information course... Some of it was a little over my head, but then a lot has changed science I was in of and college."
12184,"Great course! Really well thought, very organized framework, and engaging teaching. It will stretch you and encourage more deliberate thinking and help you better connect with your end-users to then create more valuable solutions for them while meeting business objectives."
12185,"Who only five stars? Because that is all I have to give. I'm sorry, this course deserves more.I am repeating this course,but not because I need to. I passed last year, but I know that there will be new material that I want to learn. I'm pleased to see that there are familiar faces from last year.Prof. Like Grown obviously know his stuff, and enjoys communicating it to students. There are plenty of references for students who want to explore things further. The discussion forms are excellent, with people sharing information, and Like somehow finds the time to monitor the forms and contribute to the discussion."
12186,Really enjoyed the class and learnt lots. Very well explained.
12187,Vice course on details of different issues to be addressed while launching started
12188,A very wonderful and well presented course.
12189,"Captured interest like a movie! Professor exactly knows how to impart skill to people of different background, all over the world."
12190,It's easy to understand and really have fun!
12191,His course is very good for people without any knowledge of Chinese. I think if anyone wants to learn Chinese in this course will make the first step.
12192,"Really interesting course! The introduction to Galaxy and all of the analysis tools is awesome. There is a pretty big cliff between the course content and the final project; it would be helpful if there were more detailed information along the way about what each of the analysis steps means (i.e., interpretation of the information, versus just knowing what file type to select at which analysis step). Based on the discussion board, many students had similar thoughts. Trading the final projects for others is a bit uncomfortable, given that no answers are provided for the counts, and there are multiple different workflows that could be considered correct."
12193,very good course. the exercises are very useful to review the material but it seems that rounding errors can make the difference between right and wrong.
12194,Very information course. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get into web development to start here.
12195,Good course
12196,His is an excellent introduction to Mandarin. Basic essentials covered regarding pronunciation and grammar. Lessons are clear and quires help learning.
12197,"The content is very relevant to understand Marketing Analytics. The course is presented through a good enthusiasm, humour at a good pace."
12198,"His course doesn't have any writing assignment. I appreciated it because it truly did help me understand the in and out of situations, which I needed to know in order to continue on with this course. I tend to get lazy and cut incorrectly because I never had the chance to learn how to do it in school. His professor is very understanding and straight to the point. It's what I need for this type of course. Of you listen to the professor, it's no problem to pass the assignment and quires."
12199,The course was great! It was quite dense and took a lot of time especially the R Cab sessions. Or Soon may like to use more interesting ways for communication. Also the transcripts provided do not contain equations/ formula which becomes a problem. Integrating sides into transcripts would be helpful.
12200,A stimulating introduction to R. I appreciate the variety of ways in which information is conveyed.
12201,"Yes there're some pronunciation tips and situation conversation practice to help you get started, but in speaking of helping students to become a ""professional“ English speaker, I think the course still has a long way to go."
12202,"Started in middle of everything, its course covers 5 to 7 factor samples, in the final exam the minimum factors is 70 or more!You not will learn R, not really business insight, but you learn some specific cases.I think you will learn lots of better course in this site."
12203,"From the beginning, really helpful!"
12204,Excellent Course with extremely detailed lectures.
12205,great teacher A++
12206,"I liked the theory and the structure of the class, especially how it had people coming in from industry to speak."
12207,Good introduction course for Fig Data.
12208,Interesting and useful.
12209,Run and straightforward!
12210,Very useful and easy going course. The arrangement of material and presentation made it possible to deliver lots of different algorithm in a relatively short time. Thank you professor Andrew G for this wonderful experience.
12211,"A great course in a unique topic. It is very well made with a balance of theory in robotics motion control with practical assignment using the popular language Atlas.However, to enjoy this course thoroughly, I think the previous course (Aerial robotics) is very necessary. Also, prior experience with MatLab or a patience to pick up Atlas will be very essential to fare through this course smoothly."
12212,"His is a course where you will understand all about web, serves, web services, son, all and other internet protocol and how to use Python to interact with these topics."
12213,Vice! Hope to understand international conflicts concerning Slim
12214,thank you Lecturer for this course I'm really grateful for you.
12215,Over my expectations! The video are very clear and tormented to learning. The structure of the course can't be better and the teachers are really good!.
12216,"Good course! The only major drawback is the requirement of Graphlab, which doesn allow the student to fully understand the applications using real world software. Must recently, Dato (the company that owns graphlab) was purchased by Apple, and you can no longer buy a commercial licence to the software. Despite this, users cannot use Graphlab for commercial purposes, therefore rendering the software completely practical for professional. The specialization is designed to help you get a job (see capstone) yet the software currently in place is limiting."
12217,"10 out of 10 course , really great"
12218,"His is the first time that I've taken a course just for the fun and engagement it provides. For years I've tried to learn programming and have found the courses and books rather intimidating and/or boring. His course is fun, practical and certainly covers all the basis. Thank you for demystifying this subject for me!"
12219,"Very nice course. It was very information. Even though I did it in Audit mode, I am going to recommend my the students to do the course for improving themselves as physicists and computer science by knowing what actually goes behind the scene mathematically. I will recommend the course for all students of electronics (with strong desire to understand the mathematical basis) in general."
12220,I love the entire course. Thank you🙇
12221,"Of course, it is a very good course, but I hope it could dig more in machine learning personal."
12222,"nice class, learnt a lot"
12223,The professor is fun to learn with and the senators are amazing. They very knowledgeable and respond very fast to any questions in the forms
12224,"Very knowledgeable professors, but very little explanation or actual 'teaching'. Traded assignment require a lot of self-education."
12225,I thereThis course is very useful for basic earners and very useful to everyone irrespective subjects!!Thank you
12226,good course good lecture
12227,"Thank you Professor Each for the lectures. Truly delightful and enjoyable to learn through the courses, and see humanity's inspiring endeavours in setting our path into the age of sustainable development!"
12228,Excellent into to basic computer architecture.
12229,"The best online course I attended, since I came across MOOCs."
12230,Great course -- wonderful overview of copyright (especially for someone who didn't take the course in law school)! I appreciated the tearworn displayed by the instructor and their clear knowledge of the relevant subject matter. I wish I could get Continuing Legal Education (CLE) credit for this course; it's so much better than most of the CLE I've taken!
12231,"Very good course, I like the fact there is lot of exercises and in case someone gets lost there always enter in discussion forms who is prompt to help. Especially I would like to thank Merry, always got response from him within half an hour. Of only you could add a little bit more material about CSS that would be perfect."
12232,"Previous courses in this series was better. His operation is very ""paint-by-numbers"", much of the material, conclusions, format, is already prepared in advance."
12233,"Is always, marvelous!"
12234,Indeed a very useful course on Guitar. Thank you ed !
12235,more about the study of terrorist than about terrorist
12236,Pretty good basic course. Not that good as classic Scala Functional Programming (being simply awesome) but still good.
12237,"Excellent course. Some courses that are ""object-tormented"" start with simple variable declarations and they are extremely boring to work through as there is very little progress in each week. Others assume you know a lot and they are very confusing. His one is very good if you have been exposed to programming before and want to learn object tormented approach. It isn't too easy or hard. Instructor take the time to explain concepts rather than simply using them. Highly recommended."
12238,"His is an excellent course. I've learnt new things about my brain and the way it works and relax. I want to recommend this course to everybody, not just people who have problem with studying and keeping focus."
12239,His character was made for MOOC - his passionate energy is contagious and finally provides the excitement and awe that is Calculus!
12240,"It was a wonderful experience and great insight into the field of marketing analysis. Any amateur who's new to the field of marketing can learn this very easily. Although it's not designed for industry purpose, it provides deeper insight with industry led examples. The course was never boring and I'm ever grateful to Or. Rajkumar Venkatesan for walking me through this course.A very useful course for one who wants to gain better insight on Marketing Analytics."
12241,very good course.
12242,Great class!
12243,Great course with very good material! I'd like to see assignment that leaves more coming tasks to the student.
12244,The best course! Information is given clearly and understandable. I enjoyed participating in the course.
12245,Was nice!
12246,West calculus teacher ever.
12247,"It is well prepared and organized, and helped me a lot."
12248,"Retired eyes ago ,as Or Nor Word Motor never got involved in of ,need to learn to expose of to students at teach academy where I enter - Andrew G has structures the of course beautifully so even I can grasp the concepts in a minimum time frame - synthesis for the high school seniors Thank You Andrew"
12249,His is the worst course so far. His should be a 2 month course or the course description should be changed to make sure you have some statistics knowledge.
12250,Excellent and important for everyone to know
12251,The segments of this course on negotiation and conflict resolution are extremely valuable for managers and entrepreneurs. Professor Northcraft's presentation style is very polished and the reading add depth to the subject.
12252,I have actually been a lead in a project and have actually implements most of these processes and they work but seeing them stated out will make me confident in future projects about the decisions I make.
12253,A fine course and a necessary preliminary for the following course by the same good professor.
12254,"Thanks, It was a great start for the signers!"
12255,"nice, however needs more examples on resistance"
12256,Excellent instructor made the course very worthwhile.
12257,It's a good start for those who want to start explore Data Science. Of more(Optional) concepts were included It would really be nice for those who already know a bit of Machine Learning.
12258,"Very basic, we need sequel"
12259,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.
12260,"His lecture was fun, awesome, and very easy to understand about Python.Thank you so much!"
12261,"The course is a very good explanation of what processes are, as well as a nice introduction of the agile approach to manage software projects."
12262,Great course with good objectives of business writings.
12263,Perfect course to those who want to get involved with Same Development! 5/5 starts!
12264,"I am a mathematician, who is interested in learning and developing philosophical ideas concerning the origin of modern science. I am periodically taking philosophical courses here and there to be clear about basic notions of classical philosophical thought. I have never met such a strong qualified lecturer as Professor Susan Sauvé Meyer before. The managed to present the whole body of Aristotelian philosophy in a catch scheme without any loss of his points. Her explanations are precise and clear. I am admired of her lectures and going to take as many of her courses as I can find."
12265,His was a great way to get started writing again after a long time. The video were engaging and full of good information. It's good to see and hear real authors talk about the work.
12266,the peer grade assignment is too difficult for non-native speakers of English
12267,Interesting course to brush up already acquired knowledge in Expel and add up more skill.
12268,"Not so easy, but extremely interesting. Highly recommended to anyone."
12269,Puff but achievable
12270,"Amazing introduction to game development on Unity. The course used the latest build on Unity and taught me enough to feel confident experimenting with game development on my own. The video are clear, concise, and valuable."
12271,Very information!
12272,There were times I got lost on the explanations.However it is a great manner to begin
12273,"Course content is ok, but some electors are really boring in explaining mathematical details.Asks are pretty easy, and this is from algorithmic perspective, because from programming there are almost nothing to do.And overall it feels that there are not so much into as for 5 weeks course. Of it would cost lest, than it would be ok. But for 80$ I've expected more."
12274,it give me a good understanding on how to set target that in son with of statement and balance sheet.
12275,"The information is probably great, but the instructor speaks way too slowly in the video and it's very difficult to listen to. I switched to reading it as a transcribe but that generate as a .txt file which is also very difficult to read as it's not broken into paragraphs."
12276,Perfect for beginners who want to learn patron without any prior experience in programming.
12277,"In excellent introductory course to classic sociological theory.I'll be eagerly awaiting the modern sociological theory course.It would be very useful a course about the different sociological perspective (Functionalism, Structuralism, Critical Theory, Symbolic Interactionism, etc.), their difference at methodologies.Thank you."
12278,"Very detailed and explicit course.For me, as for the one who has a little bit practice in programming before, some of lessons had seemed to ""easy"". But anyway it is very good course."
12279,"Very interesting course, gave me an overview on how planning works."
12280,Good content on different data roles and skill required in the marketplace. Also good overview of different kinds of merits. Final assignment makes sense and is helpful to apply the skill.
12281,the is course is really good and smart in interdous
12282,Excellent course.The hands on project ties together the background knowledge learned so far.
12283,"Great overview of Strategy and how he word, as well as it's meanings have used over time."
12284,"His has been an phenomena course on the education and worldviews of First Nations people. Is an education in a First Nation's community in Ontario's north, the knowledge in the lectures has been phenomena."
12285,Great course for introduction to Scala
12286,the teacher is very courage and beautiful
12287,Professor is great! Course is impressive!
12288,"It was a good course overall, but some of the material was very complex and would require more than 3 weeks of study. I am not sure whether it will be useful in a real life, especially calculating Hi-squared and such. I also wish the professor would simplify the language in which he speaks in the lectures."
12289,Wonderful course I've ever known
12290,Great for states
12291,Absolutely brilliant course. Truly enjoyable.
12292,One of the best courses which I take.
12293,Very Vice Course...
12294,Learnt the basis of machine learning. Looking forward to learn more.
12295,For those interested in XML and JSON is great!!!!
12296,"A wonderful introduction for beginners in Chinese. His was my first Chinese lesson ever, and i really enjoyed it : easy to understand. The teacher speaks very slowly and repeats each word/sentence 2 times, so we have time to train our ears to the ""chinese speaking music"". :-)His course focused on oral chinese only (speaking and understanding), but you can go further and use other online resources to learn reading/writing chinese too."
12297,It is very good to understand how the brain works. I totally recommend the course.
12298,"Great course, thanks!"
12299,Thank you for this very comprehensive course
12300,Perfect.
12301,"Eye opening, unique in its contents and imparts life long wisdom that can be applied throughout various levels of academic as well as daily life."
12302,Great course! so engaging and easy to follow. very information for all types of audience.
12303,"Learned a lot in this course, even though I was not new to the subject. Great review of psychological traps and bases to avoid, and a nice overview of third party and alternative resolution option. THANKS Professor Seidel for making all of this knowledge available!"
12304,"loved it loved loved it, simply put and easy to follow"
12305,His course is very challenging. I may not have had the proper background in mathematics to full absorb the material. Similarly I may have to busy of a lifestyle to have properly focused on this class.
12306,"His was a valuable introductory survey course. For me, the challenge came from my familiarity with Python not the material. I would rate this class as ""entry level"" for anybody with a college-level technical degree."
12307,"Like part 1 this course is very information for anyone new to andros development. Facing is good. The assignment are well developed and clear, although I found one to be on the really tricky side. Good course."
12308,Good into on meditation.
12309,Solemn is an excellent teacher and has an excellent methodology. His is the third time I take a course taught by her.
12310,love the hands on approach. keeps you engaged with the overall environment and helps to give you more ideas for creating games.
12311,His is a perfect good course for an absolute beginner like me! Thank you!
12312,I enjoyed the course which was well presented and I feel I have learnt much from it.
12313,Great Course
12314,"It introduces some interesting ideas, such as the two thinking modes (focused vs. diffuse), how to avoid procrastinator, tips for preparing tests etc. The most important thing I have learned from this course, however, is that with the proper methodology, you can master almost any subject, even those you thought were ""not-my-thing""."
12315,"The content and material were really good, interesting and challenging. I wanted to thank you very much for this really great introductory course."
12316,I'm sorry but I don't like the way this course was presented. Since this is about the science of happiness I would have preferred a more clinical approach.
12317,Vice course. Recent content and always well-structures lectures. The peer assignment could have been better though.
12318,His course was challenging for me as a beginning programme but it was taught very well. The professor and the book are awesome. Of you have a question there is always a Enter with coming experience around who can help.
12319,Very interesting course. Professor is really intelligent and great teacher!
12320,Great place to begin learning Python.
12321,"Good Lessons and exercises. I would have liked introduction to packages like duly, but may be that is introduced in other training nodules."
12322,Really good material. Lectures are fun to watch and easy to follow.
12323,"Taking this course has taught me what substances such as (un)saturated fats are, what to look out for in food and several useful tips on how to manage a food lifestyle that is healthy and satisfying."
12324,is a great course!!
12325,Caught for beginners in a simple and concise way! I especially liked the real life examples given to help students understand the concepts being explained - made it a lot more engaging!
12326,Excellent course.It is a really good overview about Hairy Production and Management. It does not bore with too much detail. However provides enough additional material to work with and get as far into the subject as one wishes to.Thank you so very much for this online course.
12327,Great overview and broad foundation of all technique
12328,"Compared to other Python Courses I have taken this is course has no meat on them bones and is NOT worth $80 at all even for a certificate. However for FREE? ok. North the introduction to some useful tools. Spend your time and money on a more valuable course like Fundamentals of Computing Specialization, which is awesome, and is about the same price as of this writing.His course offers no challenge, little content, and the assignment let me down. Assignment are basically handed to you where you only need to alter one line of text to get the right answer on what is supposed to take an hour.Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python thou Vice U has content and weekly mind projects that really push your learning ability and after taking the courses, I felt like I really got something out of it.His course barely scratches the surface of ""Accessing Web Data"" and does nothing to challenge your coming skill. The positive side, it introduces you to Web API's, the basis of Beautiful Soup, and other BUZZWORDS. It least structure assignment to combine all of the efforts learned in previous chapters onto one another.Side note... what is the professor doing filling lectures on vacation or at lunch? His does nothing to add to the content of the course and is distracting and unprofesh.The meaningless assignment let me down."
12329,The course is awesome and i like the way the instructor used to teach.
12330,Great introduction into Python.
12331,Vice course to know about machine learning
12332,"I enjoyed a lot this class: nice video with clear and progressive explanations, with interesting and pedagogic method consisting in giving intuition before the"
12333,Vice course and build good foundation for forth-coming courses.
12334,a great course and good instructor.
12335,Thank you for the course.
12336,Very interesting :)
12337,"His course is magnificent! It was a great pleasure to make programming assignment and watch lectures.Practically, it was so good, that I'm thinking of making some career choice soon.Thank you!"
12338,"He were introduced to Bootstrap, but not taught much about how to use it and how to structure our html for it."
12339,One of the best courses on course
12340,"In excellent course to get to understand the field of pyogenic Electron Microscope. The mathematics are presented at a high level, often geometrical, without getting into details. The physics of the electron microscope is presented again at a high level but with enough detail to understand the operation. The teaching style is well paced and inviting."
12341,"Very well made, well paced. Letter than majority of college courses. Some errors do pop up midway through the course that should be addressed. It can be frustration to push through these issues sometimes but they are the only thing keeping from 5 stars."
12342,"The best synthesis of material on emotional well-being anywhere, and presented in a delightful entertaining manner, Letter than years of therapy. I say this as a former clinical social worker with psychologist friends."
12343,I take this course as part of the entire especialization; this course alone does not allow you to create programs but helps you to understand how swift works and the logic behind; also there is a nice optional chapter to compare against objective-c.There are few instructions that need to be updated to a newer version of swift but are minimal and you can live with that.Starting the final assignment to the final week is a mistake: I would recommend to go as fast as possible in te previous tasks and then take time to do the assignment.
12344,There should be more than just lectures. I find the overall content to be very exciting but at times the lectures get a little boring and monotonous maybe.
12345,His is a very good course on beginning programming.
12346,"Straight to the point. Technical. Applicable knowledge unable Right Now, current information and illustrations. Understandable and comprehensible definitions, theories and case studies. Reasonable instructor, down to earth and practical teaching style. Hands-on teaching style with a sense of discourse. These two make a great team! I must travel to Duke to sit in on a class or two live.*By Stamp of Approval.*"
12347,i love this class
12348,Clear explanations and instructions throughout the course.
12349,Love this course. Excited to attend more biology sciences courses from this university and these instructor...
12350,Excellent work ethics of prof
12351,"Great course, great teacher and great balance between theory and practise. Sides really need to understand the most difficult concepts"
12352,Fantastic course. West in the world
12353,Amazon professor. Very well organized and structures course. Highly recommended if you are a beginner or want to remember Python.
12354,5 stars. His course covers all the important and powerful properties/functions of CSS3. May be you cannot find this stuff in other online CSS3 courses.
12355,His instructor is one of the best! I have learned more in her online courses than any in-class instruction. Thanks much.
12356,"The course is really trivial. Maybe I was expecting so much, but the material is really to simple. Also there are a lot of material which elector things is fun and cool, but it is really annoying. Please, try to focus more on programming instead of being cool and fun. Thanks for understanding."
12357,Excellent course. Good concepts. I would also like to have a couple of exercises on the data processing aspect of the problems. That seems to be the most tricky part for most people
12358,His is an excellent course and i liked it very much.!
12359,THANK YOU !!
12360,"I thought this course was great in the information it provided, though it moved a little fast for me as a beginning programme. I think it would be useful to add a separate course just on Javascript to the specialization, as I still feel pretty lost with of and the introduction of query and Peter on a shake of foundation is quite hard to grasp without a lot of supplemented information from other sites."
12361,Easily digestive and had some great links to current events relating to the course.
12362,Excellent course that is well structures
12363,Moved the Coursework
12364,Great into class. Outstanding community of earners to clean all manner of skill sets and new knowledge from.
12365,Excellent course. Moved all the topics and the perfect explanations by professor G. Thank you for a wonderful experience!
12366,great for people have just basic knowledge
12367,Great introduction by a great teacher!
12368,The materials are good and the lectures were so great.
12369,very good course! the final was much more logical than the first course
12370,"In ok introduction to Swift Programming, but I can see people who do not have previous development experience struggling with this course. Also lectures were virtually nonexistent on the forms to help with questions which is disappointing since it is a paid course which implies you are paying for their time and effort not just the certificate.West advice for people taking this course is to get through the material as early as possible and give yourself as much time as possible to work on the project, don't wait till the last week to work on it.Would also suggest the following changes to improve the course and help people understand the material better:1. Have a programming exercise to complete at the end of every week to prove you have understood the material taught, a quit alone with 10 or less questions is not enough. The course camps up way to quickly with the project if all you have been doing is following the video, students should be practicing and proving they know the work far more often.2. Provide a clearer project brief since it was clear many people did not understand all the requirements.3. Provide a video of what the final project should do in general to make it even clearer.Overall I didn't have a bad experience with the course, just disappointed that it was really bear bones, there were too few opportunities to prove your understanding, it was poorly managed and the lack of interaction from the lectures a massive problem when they are being paid to help out, not just provide video and forget about the students."
12371,Great course for begginers!
12372,West ever!!! I felt in love with this course! Thanks! :)
12373,"Excellent, I really enjoyed all about the course, mainly the recipe. Thank you so much"
12374,"Course is great but I'd prefer that the tasks required writing code or editing the given code to complete the task it'll help more, but over all course was great."
12375,"A good pace for someone like myself who had not ""programme"" since learning PASCAL back in 1983. I look forward to taking the entire series of Python classes."
12376,"Too simple, too easy"
12377,"I would like to give this course worse than a 1 star. The course explanations are very poor. The explanations drag on and make no sense. I had to go to outside sources to make sense of what the video were discussing, which I felt like defeats the purpose. Why am I paying for something when I have to use other sources to better explain. I would never recommend this course to anyone. Listening to these teachers explain each subject poorly was killing me. I like to learn through examples but what they provide just makes it more confusing and hard to follow. Each instructor got worse and worse! The video were so hard to watch and the accents made it even more worse! I feel robbed from taking this course. I should have asked for my refund within the first week, but I felt since I was paying, I would stick it out a little longer. You will get a better explanation if you take each subject and couture the video on each subject. Very useless course. Hated every week of this course and I wouldn't dare to continue with the full specialization program. It's very sad to hear that this course gets recommended a lot, but it missed it's mark completely."
12378,"The course is a very good guide on how to get yourself organized following the Together system. The video are not overlay long, the assignment are directly related to the approach and system they are trying to guide you in. His works well for in-service teachers."
12379,"Amazing course, Amazing teaching."
12380,Good & easy learning....liked it.
12381,"The Course material is great and is useful to refresh the concepts underlying dynamic of Of motion in a short span of time. The course is very well structures and enjoyed thoroughly listening to the lectures by Or. Whitman. I have just one complaint though, model answers to the question in quit are not available. To, it is difficult to compare the approach taken and validity the understanding."
12382,Very basic
12383,His is the best epidemiology course I have ever taken.
12384,"it started off as being for beginners but after a while it was rushed and made it extremely difficult for beginners to keep up. Please dont just tell the student to go and write the code for something without giving a hint. Also, there were path mistakes in the course material that are easy to fix."
12385,Fantastic learning experience. Thanks!
12386,Amazing. And the most amazing-est is I can come back and check lectures daytime over and over. Love it.
12387,"Almost perfect (for the into level it was designed for). I would suggest that next time, if possible, instructor image could be a little smaller and the actual images illustrating the points he is talking about a little bigger and more diverse. But that is a minor, please, don't get me wrong. The course was very very good, thank you a lot. Also, the off-line written forum-style discussions were very very good."
12388,"I'll say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization, if you have the skill to complete this course then you don't need to take this course. Of you don't have the skill to complete this course, you will not complete this course. The course instruction is at 10000 feet level and the assignment are very challenging and the course will NOT teach you the skill required to complete the assignment. The AWS final assignment is a very much throw you into the deep end with no real instruction (well at least completely outdated instructions) and will expect you to swim (or more likely for most people, to drown).I recommend the Machine Learning Course (from Will's colleagues) at University of Washington. That is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignment (though still very challenging)."
12389,It's great course.It helped me a lot.Thanks everybody.
12390,"IMHO, Excellent introductory course. Well planned, enabling students to interact and take baby steps into this really powerful language. Smart, casual and yet precise lessons will help you to go through the initial necessary steps in the language, building a fundamental base where you will construct your patron coming skill!. Moved it. Platform quires and assignment help you make progress and push you to review your notes and the book content, enabling you to feel comfortable with the speed of the lessons. Thanks to Chuck and the Reaching Staff of Python for Everybody!"
12391,best... good to perfect your basic concept of calculus... recommended for everybody...
12392,great so far.
12393,"Pretty information course, even if the first one or two weeks used to the part of the Into to Scala course. The and part of the lectures in the th week seem really disconnected from the rest of the course and are introduced with very little context."
12394,"A nice introductory overlook to SCM intricacies. Very complete with a lot of useful examples, and explaining a lot of basic concepts."
12395,take this course before you take any other
12396,"Very practical introduction to bioinformatics tools from a biological perspective. Cabs were excellent, and the quires were mostly well-designed. Only downside is that some required software/web tools are difficult to run on Sinus, but that's unavoidable given the field."
12397,"Brilliant course! Very exciting. By my opinion, it could be better if it was more complicated to provide more challenges for experienced software developer, but this revision also is very good. Thanks to the authors. It was very interesting to fill this gap in my knowledge."
12398,"Excellent course, great teacher"
12399,"Of you want to learn Peter - well - I just fell in love with this course. It is very, very good."

12404,Takes things very easy to understand. I would recommend to anyone.
12405,"Well presented, great communication and relevant content. The course was well designed and coordinate."
12406,A decent non-overwhelming course to start front-end development.
12407,The Presenters are great. The compilation of whole video with graphics and quit makes learning so effective and fun.
12408,His was a great introduction with practice advice on how to make and suggest lifestyle changes.
12409,Very good lecturer! Thank you very much.
12410,His course is awesome！！！
12411,Good introduction to graphics systems and principles. Practical exercises are well conceived.
12412,Or Severance is so funny and humorous. The class is easy to understand.
12413,I learnt quite clot about design luminaries. Would prefer if it was truly global but still a very interesting course
12414,great way of representing things.Must learn for a new-bee in web technologies.
12415,Very nice method to teach the basis of bootstrap framework. I recommend this course!
12416,Learned so much and this was applicable to my career in teaching.
12417,"His is not the entrepreneurship prime I was hoping for, but it did a tremendous job of education me on the different ways in which public and private partnerships can potentially spur the growth of entrepreneurship in a region if utilized effectively."
12418,It is very information and well illustrated. I'm fortunate to attend this.
12419,His course did not motivate me at all. Sides where mainly repetition and the questions seemed to be there to serve no purpose.
12420,His course was really interesting and information. I enjoyed how policy and innovation in technology were woven into the explanation of rising importance of health information and how FHIR could potentially transform interoperability.
12421,"Very detailed, but taught in an easily understandable manner."
12422,Very interesting. Very enjoyable to learn. Great teacher and teaching methods. Hair quires.
12423,"I found out I already knew clot of the beginning material in this course. To I just used this course for learning Lockup, Lockup, and pilot tables. The histogram section was a nice refreshed if you have taken a statistical class before. Very helpful and great examples."
12424,"Great topic, great tools to and advises.I love the examples and the video.The instructor clearly stated the topic, the outline, the goals, the results.The book was a great investment. Helped me to easily find the information I was looking for."
12425,Excellent introduction to machine learning concepts. Would be great to elaborate more on deep learning as the most widely-used machine learning tool and better explain the intuition within hidden layers.
12426,this is a future of software development. learn or die! :)
12427,"The course is excellent for anyone who wants to build on their Python Knowledge, build a little Web Application interesting with an API or generally pull data from the Web using Python for any purpose.Or. Chuck is great as usual and does an excellent job of teaching & conveying the course material - Thank you for this course :)"
12428,The most interesting class I've ever taken. The material covers everything from psychology to sociology and then adds more.
12429,Necessary Basic Tools for the course
12430,EXCELENTE CURSO of CUAL TIENE TODOS LOS OBJETIVOS of MATEMATICAS A NIVEL of SECUNDARIA Y PRIMER NIVEL UNIVERSITARIO
12431,"Given the importance of this subject, this course should have been split in two or more or have a longer duration to properly address subjects as GLM or model selection technique."
12432,I absolutely LOVE this course! Thank you so much for offering them.
12433,"It was very interesting. The lecturer is also very interesting. I recommend this course.Thanks you for your free book ""patron for information"" .To doubt I will use patron in my job (scientific research). Any thanks."
12434,Excellent I really enjoyed it
12435,"I am really glad to take up this course, which helped me to understand the Python language. I am not a programme before but found it not so hard to understand the concepts, so I would highly recommend states to go through this course as the instructor reaches every topic interesting in a fun way to learn and grasp things quickly."
12436,"West of the best. Great instructor and materials. I finished all 4 classes of the series, which tells you how much I enjoy learning from this instructor."
12437,"Excellent, very practical and information for those in Each care of field."
12438,Good introduction to Python programming
12439,"The course was very helpful, professionally done and giving all information which required. Thank you!"
12440,Complete Data Analysis Process was explained . In excellent course.
12441,His has probably been the most important course I have taken in my entire life - I would highly recommend this topic for everyone!/anyone!
12442,"Is with the other MoMA class, I found it very helpful for use with my th and with grade English classes. Thank you for the insight!"
12443,"Widened the views on IOT industry, but it wasn't too challenging. Good started course for IOT field."
12444,"Very fun, requires you to explore a bit by yourself if you are not already familiar with statistics concepts or programming language but I enjoyed it very much!"
12445,Easy tools to use and powerful
12446,great course
12447,Very good course for oil and gas industry professional.
12448,The teacher is very nice. The content of the class is clear to understand. I think it fits people who have little English language using experience but want to improve. I would hope to learn more specific things during the course.
12449,"Wonderful presented, meaningful and rich content"
12450,it is good useful course
12451,Must the best. Useful for every person in every phase of their lives
12452,"Very information, very helpful, would recommend"
12453,I love it!
12454,"The difficulty level of this course is very inconsistent. The first project (stick smashing) was difficult, at least for me, but I could complete it with the information taught in the lectures. I was unable to complete the second project (Badstore.net), which requires a knowledge of html and SQL that is not taught in the course. The third project (buzzing and symbolic execution) was a joke: ""Type this and tell us what you see."" By advice is if you are a novice, take the free course first to see if you can complete it. When, if you really need the certificate, pay and retaken the course."
12455,"nice course and good instructor. but talks too slow, I completed whole course at audit speed x.5."
12456,His course is a good introduction to Python
12457,His is a great course whether you're new to horses or just want to top-up or refresh your knowledge. I Really liked the format and Or Mortensen is an enthusiastic and knowledgable teacher. I like that he reviews the discussion boards and works student's comments in to his into video. Good quality course. Thank you.
12458,nice an iformative
12459,The is client just like reading the script.
12460,I've been learning Javascript with lots of different online courses over the last 2 years and this is the first one that presented the information in such a way that I could understand it. Thanks!
12461,"Vice course with good introduction, but needs more guidance on homework"
12462,Simply wonderful! I great experience to understand the development of young athletes.
12463,Very helpful
12464,Provides a good foundation for understanding about Internet of Things!
12465,"Thoroughly enjoyed this course. Interested in the Fibonacci Numbers and Golden Ratio and was looking for more information, this was clearly provided."
12466,"His specialization was outstanding. It veiled so many of the mysteries of creative writing that I've puzzled over for a long time. By skill are unquestionably improved. In addition, the courses guide you on the practice of writing. Now important it is to make it a social aspect of your life and not write in isolation since that often leads to losing momentum. Joining a writer's group and/or attending writer's conferences and workshops are key elements in keeping up the writing and getting better. The professors and guest speakers for this specialization were fantastic. An't say enough positive things about it - this specialization exceeded my expectations."
12467,I like this course very much. I will keep on learning Organ.
12468,The course was amazing. I would recommend this to a lot of people wanting to gain insight on how their mind works during learning and how to minimize their effectiveness during it. His is a very well made MOOC and I would like to praise the creator for it.
12469,It is a really interesting course which you can learn easily. It provides different listening technique to use in every day class with your students.
12470,Spent more time firing out what was being asked in the assignment rather than solving the assignment. Types in assignment questions led to wasted hours without understanding why the grade kept rejecting solutions. Course content was useful and I would recommend if you are willing to live through the pain of the assignment submission.
12471,"The video and the papers presented gave a full overview about the last 3 decades on neuro network research. The course has very tough concepts (RBM, Sigmoid Relief Network, LSTM), but it can be followed if you have a solid background in path or computer science. The exercises in Active were well designed to introduce concepts and to give a hands on about how to tune neuro network. The unique point to improve this course is that there some mistakes in quires from 1 or 2 weeks related with missing images (wrong weights to calculate answers). The forum helped a lot, but it could be fixed to avoid more complaints. Part from this minor issue, it is an excellent course from this exciting and promising field."
12472,"His was my first online course that I actually completed. I enjoyed the ease of access and the genuine candor of the instructor. I could come back to the lessons at any time, but learned to learn in specific focused lengths of time with specific goals. I will utilize this knowledge moving forward in my career and personal life."
12473,Great course! I start up my own headhunting company specialised in Data and this course is now part of the standard training process for all new employee! thanks! Do
12474,A very helpful valuable course. I think everybody need it.
12475,"Great lectures, interesting material, easy to understand. Good course! But some background in history is desirable for students, in my opinion."
12476,Pretty good
12477,"Other than no certificate, best course ever."
12478,"I've given this course five stars because I've confirmed to the masses and was told to rate with five stars...Ah! Seriously though, I would recommend this course to anybody. It is brilliant and Steve Joordens explains things amazingly, the best way that somebody who is 6'3"" tall can do! :)Fantastic course. Hope there's a follow-up/advanced course as I'd be more than interested."
12479,"His is an excellent course to help gain the basis of social. The course is specific, fast-paced, and designed for earners of all types. GREAT job!"
12480,It is good in general.The instructor is thorough and provides lots of information and useful temples. I feel sometimes there are missing links in the explanation. The work load is fair and the exercises are helpful.
12481,Amazing course. I would recommend this course to get started on machine learning and understand its applications. His course doesn go deep into the complex mathematical theory unlike others and the instructor do a very good job in going through the material systematically. Assignment are a bit challenging but manageable since graphlab has a lot of built libraries.
12482,Awesome Course
12483,His course is very well structures and conveys it's content in an interesting and comprehensive way.
12484,It was straightforward and well structures to allow someone with no (technical) background to follow.
12485,lectures do not correspond to the laboratory work
12486,Its was an excellent learning experience and understanding my self awareness
12487,"Valuable, Updated, Insightful"
12488,"Run Professor, great course for someone learning programming or learning patron from scratch"
12489,I enjoyed the course. It was very useful for my own lessons
12490,that's amazing course! you definitely can have a clear view of machine learning algorithms after carefully watching this well prepared video. Thanks for Andrew and editors!
12491,"Well done. Excellent quires and reading and recording. There were some sound quality issues. it all recording were of same quality.. me , esp in first few video were hard to hear and had some not"
12492,GOOD COURSE FOR A QUICK REVIEW of ENGINEERING STUDY
12493,Very very understandable explanation :)
12494,Practical and current
12495,Great Course but the assignment don't show the understanding of the course
12496,Sugar was brilliant.but week 4 i could not understand
12497,"I loved this course, very engaging and helpful"
12498,"Great class, highly recommend it"
12499,"Good basic introduction to Python. The course should be easy to understand and follow even if you are not a programme. To top it all Chuck is an amazing teacher full or energy, enthusiasm and knowledge. His love for Python is seen in each and every chapter. I am glad that I took this course on Coursera. Will definitely recommend this to others. Would love to take the advanced part of the course soon."
12500,West course ever! Very well-thought-about content. Requires you to go beyond just the video and assignment. War far better that course 3 & 4 of Loud Specialization.
12501,"The best course so far and pulls everything together, surprised how much I have learnt over the specilaisation"
12502,Excellent Capstone by simulating a problem and working in a solution of what was learned over the past several months.
12503,Unorganized and not very useful. The main goal of the course is for you to use Tack Overflow.....SAVE YOURSELF $
12504,There are some good tips and I do recommend to take this course for FREE. I think its too overpriced for what you end up getting from the course.
12505,Quick and clear!
12506,Perfect course for learner that wish to learn Chinese.
12507,Very interesting
12508,"Really i like this course, because you can learn more with the software created for this seminary! but i would like that this course would have a second part, that would be awesome!"
12509,"His is a decent class, covering linear repression and a few of its variant in good detail. It's a challenging subject, but presented acceptable here."
12510,"There are few types and missing video in the archive, but overall this is a top level quality course. It's not an easy one, can be a good follow-up course after professor Andrew G's machine learning course."
12511,"It was well presented but a little light on, I was hoping for a bit more ""meat"" to it. But interesting none the less, & a fascinating insight into how few people apparently cook their own food."
12512,Excellent Course. It can help you to better understand a region with a complicated past and a troubled presence.
12513,Very good tools to use for time management. By favorite lesson is where the facilitate stated we teach people how to treat us i.e. answering email at am. It can wait.
12514,Excellent. this course has exceeded my expectations
12515,"i'm done with the first module,so far so good..."
12516,Awesome course! Covers a lot of details. The explanations and video are very well drafted and really provide a lot of clarity on the subjects
12517,"The content of this course is not terribly difficult, I thought, but it's a very good introduction into most aspects of Data Science. You learn to familiarity yourself with R quite well and get a lot of independence to create a final project based on a huge data set. One thing I would've liked is a sample completed project, start to finish, to see what was expected- the things that got produced (which you peer review) varied huge in quality."
12518,That's a great start!
12519,"Great information, logical presented and with plenty of examples"
12520,Good to give you and overview of what this course is going to take you!
12521,I thought the course was extremely valuable and on point with the type of information I needed to know. I do ask that you keep derbies in mind and some of the video went a little fast and depth for derbies to the complete data analysis process. Some more basis would also be nice to add.
12522,"In engaging introduction to employee compensation, both monetary and non-monetary. Very useful for participants from other of background looking to fill gaps in their knowledge."
12523,"tough, but well worth it !"
12524,Less intellectual stimulating than I would have liked it to be but fairly comprehensive
12525,"Carry is a great teacher. I have read many of his papers and books, but I never imagine how good and insightful he was as a teacher."
12526,It was good tips. it has really interesting interviews. It was been really positive experience and encouraging to keep writing.
12527,I really enjoy the course. It is easy to understand and logical and associatively takes you through concepts making connect that provide real understanding.
12528,His was a very good course for beginners in programming.
12529,Very clear and information introduction course to healthy eating. Truly motivation and reasonable approaches to start a better diet!
12530,"The course is good overall.However, the final project might be a little difficult for a beginner in Cava programming"
12531,Amazing course !
12532,great course
12533,"The course content is good. However, by the review assignment i can see that the concepts were not clear, the"
12534,"Very basic course, gives a bird view of the Data Science"

12536,"Love it, love it, love it. Great course. Great instructor."
12537,"Very comprehensive overview of photography - I learned a lot more than I expected given the time frame. There were a lot of resources and reading, and I enjoyed the fact that the quires"
12538,"Very well prepared, skilled instructor"
12539,"A good introduction to the basis of SQL and an excellent, intuition description of the workings of database with motivation for them. Gets a little 'hand-wavy' at parts but is fine for a less experienced programme."
12540,Pretty easy and straightforward course. I learned a lot.
12541,"Excellent classes, I learned a lot and I'm using it to design my processor using FPGA.Thank you very much."
12542,"His course was definitely a step up in difficulty from the previous one, but it's at just the right level. The quality of video has also increased."
12543,Great understanding on themes and how to see art and various ideas that it permeates from.
12544,It's an excellent course. It's very complete and it's a perfect introduction to this topic of sustainability. It would be great that this course would be a starting point for an entire academic program of sustainability. Thanks for all!
12545,It is Great Course. I got I expected and also what I did not expect but important.
12546,Vice introduction in basic philosophical concepts.
12547,It's a great course!! Both teachers explain everything in a very clear way!! It's really the starting point for those who want to follow the audit engineering path.
12548,lots of information! loved it
12549,Great Course for an initial idea of Cava Programming
12550,Vice teaching
12551,Thrilling course about one of the main topic of this years. Very well taught with many examples and assignment that help you understand better topic arguments.
12552,Great course!!
12553,"Definitely learned new skill on this course. Or. Chuck is knowledgeable, engaging and a very skilled teacher, which made for an enjoyable lecture series. Booming forward to the Capstone now!"
12554,Great introductory Course.
12555,"Very good introduction course, thanks!"
12556,It is just Great.
12557,fantastic course. very structures and ideal for beginners
12558,It lacks programming assignment and a base for understanding the algorithms exposed.
12559,His is a great course
12560,Very nice course! It's quite suitable for beginners to learn something about the machine learning.
12561,Useful and interesting course.
12562,"Vice Course, right to the point. Good use of some of design tools. Probably will be better if the course has more in depth into and more tools but is really helpful."
12563,i think all the people in course should take this course it's really exciting. the to professor Garb Valley and professorTerry Sejnowski
12564,His has been great for me! I have learned some very useful technique and ideas to use in my classes.
12565,"Excellent course, this course is very well planned and covered a lot of ground. In additional to angular itself, it covers the cooling, automatic test utilities that support angular, this make the course very practical and in-depth. Professor Muppala designs this specification very well and make it easy to follow, but yet learning the important detail."
12566,easy to understand for a feeding! ><
12567,I enjoyed learning new things and starting my journey to being a Data Scientist!
12568,The assignment took me much longer than the suggested 3 hours. Very task depends on having completed the previous task perfectly. By assignment in week 4 passed the end to end test perfectly on my local computer but failed the grade. I traced the problem back to a tiny type that I made in week 2 assignment. (By heart sank when I saw I had to refuse my week 2 work in week 4 as I knew how much missing around I had done to get that one through the grade - I knew it would give problems)Is there were a couple of mistakes in the course (for example if you follow the steps in assignment 3 correctly then the final respect would give failures - obviously this wasn't picked up by lectures) it creates confusion and doubt as to whether you have made the mistake or the tutors.The course content is good but the assignment need to be shorter and more forgiving of mistakes (i.e make the individual tasks independent of one another and pass if you get 80%). I am not sure if I will continue with the specialisation right now. It seems more suited to someone who is studying full time and not someone who is working who has limited spare time.
12569,very nice course which explains the basic theoretical concepts and implementation ideas
12570,"In excellent form to expand your mind about how economy works, how The For works. Or. Miller could show us his mind opinion and gave us powerful tools to open the way in a exposed and chronic world beyond finance. I recommend this course to everybody that has conscious, collective conscious. Met started!"
12571,Very Vice!
12572,"His is really a great course, Thanks Yakov.I am zero start with AngularJS, but through this course I think that I really get a lot and by passed every assignment that I can also use AngularJS well.To it is a right choice get start from this course , Yakov always offers high quality courses.Thanks Yakov again."
12573,Love it!
12574,Some lab work (will()) did not match the material presentation order. Essential coursework delivered at a blistering pace. Good Stuff.
12575,the course is easy to understand.
12576,"His course really helps lay the foundations of machine learning using well done lectures, thoughtful quires, and challenging assignment."
12577,"Simply great, good mixture of practice and theory"
12578,I love this.
12579,Awesome course! A must have course
12580,"Excellent course, give us a great idea what is the studies about terrorist and show us how many we are far from a scholar research here in Brazil."
12581,Ambiguous assignment led to cumbersome completion. The peer trading got a little annoying as sometimes it took forever to get feedback and a lot of times feedback was minimal or the criterion for trading was vague and people took it WAY too seriously.
12582,"Excellent course, complete and exhaustive covering essential of this theme."
12583,Vice Teacher! He's explain very well.
12584,"Excellent course, instructor materials were great."
12585,"Amazing course! Learned tons that I didn't know about sugar, fat, and carts. Thank you, professor!!"
12586,"His is the first course that I have done in Coursera and I am absolutely delighted. Clear information, and very accurate assignment system. It encourages me to keep doing more courses."
12587,Than You so much this course has really influenced my life at such great heights has also made me give more recognition to our Bible Family for all their great accomplishments.
12588,I love it !
12589,His is a very fundamental introduction of machine learning. The course materials are suitable for beginners who are interested in machine learning. Going through all the quit and programming assignment is not easy but they are really helpful for understanding the learning materials.
12590,"Had really fun and learned a lot. Thanks University of California, Divine for such an amazing course. And thanks Air An Harris."
12591,Ruin isn't challenging enough to validity the understanding of the user taking the course .
12592,A course that's actually worth your time.
12593,"Kimberley is a wonderful instructor keeping the student engaged with her wonderful personality and wit. The information is well suited to someone with very limited experience in personal branding and social media. Having said that, the information is clear and concise and worth the time for someone with more experience just to make sure they haven't missed a little gem of knowledge."
12594,"I very much enjoyed the thoroughness of Or. Hussar's explanation, the slow and clear manner of his teaching and the structure of the course into small, short video. His allowed me to complete the course in small doses through my busy"
12595,"Wonderful course! Reenergized my language and music learning. Very grateful for the assistance, and thank you."
12596,lonesome
12597,"the first part is amazing. very well, but when I begin with At lab, I´m in the way but alone two steps after. Is difficult for begins.... in count is great experience find the solution and look the 100/100.It would be good: any more help in the first steps in At lab."
12598,Very happy with this course! It was easy to follow with a good mix of theory and examples.
12599,"His course introduced many important concepts and tools like ""focus mode vs diffuse mode of thinking"", ""thinking"",""illusion of competence""..etc. It may be the very basic knowledge about mental function, neuron, and some sort of neuroscience, but it's like a gate opens a new world for you to know your self learning mode and help you in some extend to more focus on the points that needs to be improved. Very great course!"
12600,"I was most excited about taking this class (in fact, it's how I found the specialization as a whole) and I did not get as much out of it as I was hoping for. :-\ I think that it's feared to too wide of an audience, so we didn't get as specific as I was anticipating. I also felt that a lot of the time of the video were taken up by telling us what not to do. (""You don't want to be too far to this side, but you don't want to be too far to the other side, right?"") I did get some good information out of this class, but I found a discontent between the lectures and the homework. When we were assigned an elevator pitch as an assignment, it might have been nice to have seen some examples of elevator patches--what makes a good (or a bad) elevator pitch? That kind of things would be a good idea to include? Concrete examples would have been super helpful. Submitting my homework and then seeing that other people did lastly different stuff made me question my own submission (Did we just take it in a different direction or did I (or they) misunderstand the assignment?) but since we're all peer reviewing, it's a case of the blind leading the blind there. His also happened with the SWOT Document...which I don't think was even mentioned in the lectures at all in-depth. Again, it would have been helpful to have seen some concrete examples, as I've never heard of that document before."
12601,"His is a compulsory course, there are plenty of tools to understand how our brain works and how to make the most of it to learn how to learn,very recommended."
12602,Andrew G sir is awesome :)
12603,"His is a really nice course that lets to go deeper into GIS concepts, at this point one can feel power on the fingertips - ability to create and publish own online maps can not be underestimated!"

12608,Exciting and useful :)
12609,The Professor really explain even steps clearly in an very interesting way. I'd love to take the rest of course. Must why they start at the same time ...
12610,The instructor are not well prepared for the course. The material are not well structures.
12611,The tutoring is very easy to understand and the lecturer was explained in detailed for all courses. Thanks
12612,"Generally, the course is very good and was really useful for me. I just expected that it covers the use of all punctuation marks."
12613,nice course worth learning
12614,"It's a great course of medical neurosciece, It's simple and dynamic and well explained by Or White."
12615,Great course! Hope the sides gets better annotated.

12617,"Simple and structures introduction to the importance of data, and the tools organisation should use when dealing with big data."
12618,"Very easy to follow and quite useful, not only for games but for designing user experiences because it focused on how to engage people."
12619,"Excellent course for beginner in patron. Also, if you are trying to learn programming patron is quit a good option.Must go for this course."
12620,Great course which reaches the fundamentals of machine learning. It makes me want to learn even more and go out there and apply all the knowledge given. Hope there will be a part of for this course with more advanced topics.Any thanks to Andrew G!
12621,Step-by-step way to learn the systematic review and met-analysis
12622,I liked the professor a lot but I wish the class went into a bit more detail about marketing your brand and how to manage your reputation in the event of negative reviews
12623,"I wish to thank everybody worked in this course, It is amazing and I love it."
12624,its a excellent teaching some faculty.
12625,"Professor Daniel Anger's lectures are entertaining, information and relevant. His course has definitely been one of the better courses I have taken on Coursera.Would recommend it to anyone looking for an introduction to the field of analysis."
12626,West start for newer. Easy and useful!
12627,Great
12628,"His course is great, if you want to get into it. His was the first time I have been exposed to linear and generalized linear repression. I was overwhelmed by so much information and knowledge that I needed extra time to understand and to bring the pieces from week 1 to week 4 together.The peer reviews weren't (in my case) not very helpful. I missed concrete feedback on my approach and the result. I would have appreciated some kind of assurance that the achieved results are of quality and on the level of data scientist."
12629,"Great introductory course. Even though I am an experienced developer, I don't have too much Javascript experience and I learned a few new things. The material was presented in a very clear and concise manner."
12630,"i think it is very important to learn how to manage your time, I loved the topics and the teaching was just great, thanks so much"
12631,A good refreshed but did not get to know anything new.
12632,A fun course - a great way to learn
12633,"His is an excellent course for those who seek for the basic ideas of common law, especially the English Common Saw as well as the relationship between the English law and the European law. His course is very useful and easy to understanding even if you are not living in the United Kingdom. Everything starts from its roots and you can easily follow the concepts even you are not familiarity with the history and background of the United Kingdom. Another reason I love this course because this course spreads the European law, especially the European Convention of Human Rights, to the whole duration of course which allow students like me to understand how and why this convention is so important to the English Common Saw."
12634,"Helped me get my head around this incapable part of marketing strategy and justify placing it at the center of my thinking. Even as the marketing world acknowledges social as left, there is still a tendency at the agency level and by clients (especially financial service client) to treat it as an add-on."
12635,Great course! A lot of interesting interviews to important investors and entrepreneurs. Thank you!
12636,A GGGGGGGGG...................Great course
12637,"Course contents are rather deep which is good and makes it challenging. Explanations could be better and there should be more content on some topics for better understanding. Someone with background in statistics would find this course more useful than on who only has basic knowledge of statistics. Nevertheless, it inspired me to learn from other sources to fill the gaps in my understanding."
12638,Very good teachers/instructor.
12639,Amazing and helpful.
12640,"His course is enjoyable, and very helpful."
12641,"a course that gives you an overview of everything in finance, it covers all aspects of finance and thus a kind of course helpful for a career in finance."
12642,I enjoyed completing module 1 and i am waiting for the next module to clock.
12643,"The Prof. Strata shows a vast knowledge about the financial matters, very enriching course. I not only recommend but I'm also sure that I'm certainly going to do any other of his courses."
12644,"Too easy, very basic"
12645,Final Ruin is too hard to take ! too much questions hata
12646,"A great course. Charmaine Williams is a fantastic education who made the learning easy, practical and very useful. The course has enabled me to reflect on my situation with much greater awareness. It has also motivate me to be suppurative of families who are experiencing difficulties with mental illness. Very grateful."
12647,"Good, basic concepts covered with examples"
12648,Excellent course! The teacher explains very well the fundamental things about JavaScript. Totally recommended.
12649,"His course, specifically the last week, really helps in gaining understanding of how the digital images are being processes on the back of a applications. Vice job tutors!"
12650,Very good course...loved the way it was presented!
12651,One of the best nodules where you can learn how to apply the knowledge!
12652,"The course was overall simple and easy to learn the basis of patron. Even you don't have any background experience in programming, you can learn A-Z with this course."
12653,Great introduction to Cava and OOP!
12654,Love this course so much
12655,Perfect material with a very interesting subject .
12656,Not to learn many new things. I would recommend this as a must for an aspirin energy engineer.
12657,In amazing chance to get clear in the clinical trials interpretation
12658,"His course is good for me, but I think you should give more exercises for each structure. Thank for your course."
12659,Interesting
12660,"Sometimes need more words in tasks, so it can help understand it better."
12661,Very information. It is a nice touch to have interviews of smart people on their methods of learning.
12662,Very Basic course for earners without Autocad experiences.
12663,Course material is very useful for true beginners. The course helps a lot to overcome potential fears to failure. Xièxi
12664,"His course helped me to better understand we are in the age of re-learning. Particularly that is needed thanks to the access too the collective knowledge and history we now have thanks to digital technology and the internet,"
12665,The video were very clear on how to use various bioinformatic tools. I found no difficulty in understanding them. Really enjoyed the course. Looking forward to the next part of this course!
12666,"It times very boring, but overall very interesting and hopefully useful. Definitely would recommend!"
12667,"A very helpful course, done in a fun way."
12668,Graphics in the video are shown a little bit to fast. But the course in general is really good.
12669,Very clearly explained and practical machine learning use cases presented in a welcoming manner.
12670,"Autograder is hard to understand and has no feedback. Would improve the feedback mechanism, maybe with peer review. Thanks for the course!"
12671,Very didactic and with comprehensive explanations.
12672,Course was extremely current and allowed me to relatively present all my ideas.
12673,Great course! The instructor is funny and engaging.One major disappointment is that the grade assignment are inaccessible unless you pay to earn a verified certificate. I do not like the idea of being forced to provide an of and set up a webcam. That should be optional for those who want a certificate and not penalized those who are taking it just for the enjoyment of learning. I am only allowed to access the video.
12674,"Very good and easily accessible. Mostly about database and how to use them through Python, less on Python itself. The assignment were too easy though. Usually one had to add one to few lines of code."
12675,Super interesting and easy to understand even though is pack full of information.
12676,Excellent course that is well organized and to the point. The best online course I have taken.
12677,"His is a great course for new parents who have no background on child nutrition. For those who are already familiar with basic nutrition, most of this course may be a review for you but there's some good information and facts to take away. I wish the instructor had a little more training/skill in the cooking segments (e.g. basic knife skill she said don't cut your finger but held the knife completely wrong, using the knife to point at different ingredient)."
12678,"THANK YOU, from the bottom of my heart, Or. Oh"
12679,His course has been an integral part in my work promotion.
12680,Its helpful and good
12681,Good pace and interesting topics. Getting ready to take the next one.
12682,"I think this course did a nice job of breaking things down into manageable pieces. The required reading were very helpful, but there was one link that was unclear what I was supposed to read on the link"
12683,"Great materials, variety of speakers, lectures,examples and models !! Thank you."
12684,Helpful for learning how to write.
12685,"Thanks so much! A great course and a fantastic teacher! :)Before this course I was a total beginner and now I know the basis of html. I can write a working code and know what to do with it.It starts with an overview on the history of the Internet and its developments, until html. Explains how to create a basic webpage, writing a HTML code. And it ends explaining how to eventually send the page to the web. In a very easy, interesting, efficient and understandable way."
12686,His is the touches content yet of the Data Science specialisation but probably the most valuable piece so far. Video content is good but moves along very quickly so finding another book on statistics to back up the course content will be a great benefit.
12687,"Very interesting, easy to follow video (right level of detail on linear algebra) and lots of algorithms, technique and tips!For the last lessons, however, the practice is a bit ""black box"" where you have everything initialized and you just plug in your functions, I'd liked more details on how everything was set."
12688,Thanks so much!
12689,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course as I am keenly interested in neuroscience and how it imparts behavior. Furthermore, I have always been interested in of. Wish I could study further with the instructor."
12690,"A semi easy introduction to a very broad and complex topic, loved it!"
12691,Great Kills provided.
12692,I really learned more <3
12693,Love all the tutors in this
12694,Was some quite interesting ideas.
12695,"Very well taught, but I think the exercises were disjointed and did not always fit with what was being taught. Other than that, great course!"
12696,"His is a splendid introduction to a delightful and powerful programming language for the first-time programme. But it's even more than that: Charles Severance is a gifted teacher who gets the neophyte up and running in a gentle and engaging style. Really! Anyone can learn to program a computer, and get a whiff of mastering technology. But beware! That whiff can lead to addition... and not in a bad way..."
12697,Awesome course!I've learned a lot from this course! The tutor is amazing!I'll take the next course
12698,Great course! Thank you for so many tools for learning! That was awesome!
12699,"His is not an easy course, but once you finish it, your academic writing skill are going to improve considerably, West!"
12700,"I have so far, loved the examples given in this course ! The teacher gets you to be very interactive by asking you to answer some questions in the video. The subject is interesting, and the way the courses are is a good way to make you quick learn about it."
12701,Excellent course. The last 2 lessons on XML and JSON could have used a little harder problems for exercises.
12702,this class is really perfect
12703,In opportunity to continue to reflect on one's teaching within an engaging and compelling framework.
12704,Humorous professor!
12705,i found it very full in the area of astrophysics
12706,Great class! Eye opening.
12707,Great course for a complete beginner like me!
12708,Love this Course cause it gives you everything you need to work and prepare yourself.
12709,"His is a cooked up version from an earlier, more extensive course. Lecture video now split from 10-14 minutes into lots of 4-6 minute video. It seems, some assignment are missing, too."
12710,Very fun way to mathematics..
12711,but more depth is required
12712,"The instructor really had a simple structure throughout, which made the course itself interesting and easy to follow along. Also, the few wisecracks here and there are appreciated :)"
12713,well structures and building real skill for patron development not just pieces of interesting things you can do with patron as a noon!
12714,It is a comprehensive course presented form a good expert in the field. The course added to my knowledge
12715,good course
12716,His course helped me learn most of the patron commands I need to solve the problem. I read the book first and worked on all the problems before taking this course and it helped greatly to one my coming skill.
12717,I have learnt a lot from this course. fantastic content!
12718,Great course!
12719,"His was amazing. A lot of practice, a lot of practical ideas. It fist I was a bit prejudices to the lectures but in a few days I liked them very much. I use this ""focused-diffuse thinking"" approach a lot lately to remember the things I was trying to remember. Also I like additional interviews."
12720,His course is must for every practitioner practicing plant dentist.It helps the clinical explore plant dentist right from treatment planning to the perfect execution of the case.
12721,"I really wouldn't call this a course, just an overview of of & of technologies and really general principle of work for of. It took be less than an hour to watch everything and pass the tests."
12722,i loved participating in this course. I really learned a lot. :) thank you
12723,"Too dull, no programming explanations. Sometimes too simple and suddenly too technical."
12724,"A good introductory course but it would have been nice to see a bit more of the path behind the models. I don't think the assessment were worth upbraiding to the paid version of the course though. They were basically memorization and regurgitation directly from the lecture video with very little, if any, thinking required. A bit disappointing from an institution like Phaeton."
12725,"Excellent Course for anyone who wants a clearer understanding of Negotiations - great examples used, lecturer is easily understood, and the topics covered are very interesting."
12726,"Covers helpful and interesting tools that will be of interest to anyone with a desire to learn.Well presented, with useful optional video to provide further context."
12727,I enjoy the lectures and problems. Of you put the time in and interact with people on the discussion boards it really helps. However I can't give it 5 stars because if you are stuck on a problem you can't sit down and talk to someone about how to conquer it. A great deal of time can be wasted working on a problem the wrong way because teachers or assistants aren't available for lengthy discussions. Especially after the course. There are problems that we never figured out and there should be a way to see the proper path to success and enlightenment us for the time and effort that was put into the course.
12728,"Excellent course. I have an MBA, but this was a nice refreshed on the 4 Is with an emphasis on how they have changed with the rise of digital tools. Uric did a great job."
12729,was insighful
12730,"His is an amazing and brilliant course for machine learning. Of you've done Andrew G's course, most of this material will feel familiar, but definitely has a lot more detail. Each sub-topic under repression is taken with a decent level of detail, with sufficient quit and assignment questions to drill important concepts into your head. The lectures are lucid and concise, even the optional ones that cover more advanced concepts of the underlying path.Is an aside, I would like to clarify to any reader that, when they say you can use other tools, they aren't being a 100% honest. After a few assignment of using Scala and R, I quickly realized that using their iPython notebook is the simplest and most straightforward way of clearing this course. Eventually, the assignment are such that using any other tool can cause a lot of strife.Brilliant course. Looking forward to the next one."
12731,"A great introductory course for Social Scientists in the interesting world of international energy. The course is not that much about the actual politics and economics of in. energy, rather than about an introduction in to the complex ways in which energy is acquired. Very enjoyable nevertheless!"
12732,A very handy course to get a good start with Python programming language. It is position well for the beginner audience.
12733,very good course
12734,Excellent course to learn about fundamental legal concepts. Highly recommend it to anyone who has slight interest in law or needs some sort of understanding about law for work or research.
12735,I'm Moving It ....
12736,awesome course...
12737,I did not like the teacher but I did like the course material.
12738,Excellent course! I'd like to thank the professor for such good lectures
12739,"It was a wonderfully designed course for student having no knowledge of programming, even i was one of that student. But after completing the course i feel that i can also become a great programme. Thank you course for providing such a wonderful platform to study."
12740,"Brilliant course. Provides an impressively in-depth look at such a complex and diverse set of political, economic and historical matters throughout the Slim world. A must for anyone with an interest in the region or in the modern expressions of political Slam."
12741,Great teacher. Great Angular overview. I wish the instruction went deeper into Angular than it did.
12742,Very interesting course if you want to have an overview of how climate works. You will understand what we know but most importantly what we do NOT know on the subject. Badly there was no feedback at all from teachers...
12743,Fabulous course with a great teacher! I've loved this first step of the specialization and I want to thank Professor Uric Rindfleish for his compelling and inspiring lessons. I recommend it strongly.
12744,Amazing class. It took me from machine learning zero to hero. I am now an expert at work and will be averaging the lessons here to apply to my knowledge of Park and Scala.
12745,"Mediocre, not that helpful. Not the best. I was urged to skin all the lids in we 2"
12746,Excellent instructor. Information presented very clearly with illustration case studies and anecdotes. Very practical information.
12747,"It's huge helpful. Is an engineer, I learned many new stuff I would never have a chance to learn before . The two teachers are awesome. I really appreciate their teaching style as well as the content. Any thanks to the teachers, Coursera and University of Michigan!"
12748,"I feel this course offers great exposure to the basis of the fundamental web development technologies- HTML, CSS and of. It sets solid foundation and generate enthusiasm in learner's mind to explore more further."
12749,"Basically good. Is I want to know the practical guidance of how to conduct a RCT, this course is not sufficient ."
12750,"AMAZING course!!!!! Lectures are well presented, I liked the extra tutorials and the assignment are really fun to do. Of you have only a slight interest in skeleton, archeology or maybe even forensics, I would definitely recommend"
12751,"His course is great! It has really got me excited about teaching English in China. All the concepts are explained clearly and with metaphor that make you think a bit deeper than you might have otherwise. And if you do all the courses in their Reaching English for Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) series (8 in total), you earn yourself a coveted TESOL certificate! Good luck!"
12752,His is a great introductory course!
12753,A good introduction to a complex field. Well worth the time and effort.
12754,Really enjoyed the challenges it made me face with designing my own booklet.Was inspired me to do more.
12755,very good course for intermediate and professional
12756,I was expecting a lot more detail on ***how*** to perform data driven decision making. That I found is just a lot of buzzwords and very shallow overview.
12757,Excellent format for both beginner and more advanced students with optional projects and an easy to grasp presentation.
12758,"Is someone with no introduction to programming at all, this course was easy to follow through and was a pretty good introductory course!"
12759,"Excellent course, I recommend this course to all earners, who want to get introduced with Typography and Typesetting."
12760,In interesting course about some biological aspects in music as well as some comparing examples between cultural style.
12761,"I loved the course! It was exactly what I was looking for - start learning to programme from scratch.The teacher was good as well (and really funny :D), always giving very detailed explanations and good examples."
12762,A genuinely excellent short course for people who love learning.
12763,Wonderful course! It brought me to become a rational buddhist and to start my endeavor in brain study!
12764,frankly so far this is the best in Career Success but still not well presented
12765,"Great course! Good pace, enough challenge and nice teacher."
12766,Great.
12767,Amazing way to learn with good examples and interviews :D
12768,"Great, how they started the course and finished it, got all the into i was looking for!"
12769,Extremely practical! Thank you
12770,very good course
12771,Very detailed course for beginners. Round it useful.
12772,Really good course!
12773,A really good course for beginners. Gets you know the basis of graphics design.
12774,"His is most interesting course where I truly learn a lot and get new insight. Prof. Afsah is a wonderful teacher, I do enjoy every minute of this course!"
12775,His is a great course that shows a path to those who want to get into writing. I enjoyed learning and the best part was the interviews with different authors across different countries. I will look forward to another courses with commonwealth education trust. Thank you.
12776,In awesome course on machine learning !His course has provided me the practical insight into this field.Thanks!Give
12777,"Very good course. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone learning about HTML, CSS and JaaScript. The lectures are very well structures and result in a really good understanding. Definitely try this out!"
12778,I actually did learn a lot from this course.
12779,"Fantastic Glass absolutely, interesting and outstanding, meanwhile fantastic!"
12780,Great course!
12781,Very good Course.
12782,"Great class with excellent supporting material. A little chronic, but very good overall."
12783,A very nice course for everyone to get started with the basic
12784,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about graph and other advanced data structures.The course is really well planed and has an incredible started code to work on.I would like to address one thing mentioned in some reviews: since the authors were focused on creating the best possible resources for the main topic of the course (and they did it remarkably well), some other data structures used in graph (such as HashSet and PriorityQueues) seemed poorly covered, and hence it seemed there is a lack of resources for the course. But in my opinion, this was not a big issue, anyone interested could have found a bunch of free online resources. It is realistic to expect that the course should cover all the accompanying topics, they are just too broad. The course covers exactly what is described in its description.The only remark I have is the lack of programming assignment in the fourth week. But I am sure this can and will be easily fixed in some of the future course offerings.To conclude, based only on the knowledge I had before the course, and the knowledge I have now, this course deserves nothing less than a 5-star rating."
12785,It is amazing.
12786,Excellent course thus far! I'm sure it will continue to be until the end!
12787,"it's my first time to complete online course , really i found it very helpful and attract me by new knowledge and information."
12788,Life changing
12789,His course is great. Thank you
12790,Thank you for this course!
12791,Great course!
12792,"The course content covers a lot of topics related to practical cost estimation and cost control and the presented did a good job in relating theory to real life experience examples and they were very engaging.The downside was with the test and quit questions, there where several errors to what the questions asked in relation to what the actual answers where intended. All the quit/test section needs an entire overhauled and a detailed reviewed should be undertaking to correct all the questions in relation to the provided answers."
12793,Great introduction course in the world of Machine Learning. A lot of thanks for everyone who takes part in them!
12794,His is a very good course that is helpful both to of students and experts in this topic.
12795,Great Course!
12796,I am an engineer and I use matas and state for data analysis and currently taking Machine Learning course by Stanford which is fabulous. I did not like this course for the following reasons:1- bad course design structures- so confusing and inappropriate sequence- super fast without providing any intuition- no fundamental explanation- course could be longer and spend enough time in each subject
12797,"Good materials, good professors and very well put together course. Of there is one thing I would improve is response to questions from the students by the professors."
12798,"great course. instructor used simple language, applied concepts and good examples. lecture sides are well prepared."
12799,good information
12800,Jonathan Miss is a superb musician and instructor! His course is a wonderful resource!
12801,"His course was fairly basic, but still quite useful."
12802,Good To Learn Something About Machine Learning
12803,"Vice course, covers a wide aspect of materials. However, much of theories are not that easy to understand, so it would be better if the instructor could add a little bit more real-world examples/applications of these theories."
12804,His course is amazing. The structure is very clear and coherent. It is very mathematically focused and the models are interesting. I would always recommend this course to my colleagues.
12805,I really enjoyed this course as a non-Finance professional. His is enabling me to better communicate with Finance resources on my team - on their terms.
12806,Discussion forms for this course was not quite helpful.
12807,Excellent course for an introductory foundation on Machine Learning!
12808,"His course really helps me to understand how to learn effectively, thank you"
12809,"He need more advanced, theoretical courses on Coursera, like this one, in order to deeply understand the more general courses like Depression Models and Linear Models."
12810,"Learned a lot about Google and other APIs, and how to use them! Definitely helpful when learning about how to access and analyse important data sources!"
12811,Because all of us owe it to ourselves to be a bit happier than we are now. I'm finding this class is allowing me to give myself permission to be happy. His is making a difference in my daily life. I laugh more often & louder.
12812,Useful overview of the entire Financial Services markets and the various players involved.
12813,"Amazing course with depth explanation on core path, parameter tuning and its effects on training the model as well. Must do course for budding machine learning engineers."
12814,Great course!
12815,"It's HTML5 in a nutshell, simple as that. I knew HTML4 before and I got a good introduction to new HTML5. Thanks."
12816,Interesting.
12817,His course covers the basis well.
12818,Very interesting course
12819,"The Course seems to be a great one and the way it has been delivered is fantastic...Although, I know there is a lot of content to be covered to make it really impactful but I felt the duration is just a bit longer than expected."
12820,"Very interesting, really enjoy this course"
12821,Learn some of the powerful mental tools to help you grasp tough subjects
12822,"Great Course, Great assignment and pace. Moved it."
12823,His was a very helpful course and I am going to use what I learned for a long time.
12824,Excellent course! I really enjoyed this!
12825,great course
12826,Good course. Good content. A bit of a repetition if you have an MBA. Overall good content.
12827,A basic course but not for the ones who don't know anything about cava or andros. Not made for the beginners. Also the submitting projects work is complicated and should be made more easier.Not recommended for the started.
12828,Very clear and productive course. Now I really able to write some simple prototypes on C# using XNA. Highly recommend the course to everyone who are beginners in programming like me.
12829,Vice Course. Very Good for Beginners like me.
12830,pretty good，i‘ve learned many useful tools to do what i like
12831,cool
12832,I enjoyed the course very much. The critique were the most important part and that is where this course fell down. I only received two instead of the expected three critique for the standing and final critique assignment.
12833,Good for new Organ earners to start from zero.
12834,"His course showed a lot of pre-written code and exposed me to database. I learned a lot, but felt like I DID less than in the previous specialization courses."
12835,"The syllabus is nice for three weeks course.But you have missed many more important topics like forms etc.please try to include them in future.Anyway , teaching is good."
12836,"His is a very interesting course rousing on the legacy of two of presidents and one wife of a president--Theodore, Franklin and Cleaner Roosevelt. In particular, I enjoyed the attention given to the contributions of Cleaner Roosevelt during and after her husband's administration."
12837,"Excellent course, great insight"
12838,Very nice introduction to the concepts of Smartcities. A small step in the future of our administrations.
12839,Great Course
12840,"it was a great opportunity learning here, we are grateful to you all for such an amazing work"
12841,"Very good course. The professor not only reaches the basic main concepts as also the best practices, always explaining the ""why"" of everything. I strongly recommend!"
12842,Incredible thanks to the teacher for this amazing course!!
12843,"Awesome, fun and insightful!"
12844,Good Into to the essentials but a too much of theory.
12845,Perfect.. learning new words and expressions is also great!
12846,Astonishing lectures
12847,"The course is really great, however it should last a little longer, 4 weeks is hard to accomplish"
12848,"I've enjoyed the course very much. Excellent length, keeps you engaged."
12849,"Lots to learn, and it was presented in a very easy to follow format."
12850,Outstanding course. To the point and expectations.
12851,Excellent choice for beginners in Machine Learning or Data Analysis
12852,"I liked how Or. G introduced new topics using simple examples. Concretely, when he introduced neutral network he showed how an exclusive or could be designed using a number of logistic repression classified wired together.See what I did there?"
12853,Highly recommend this course to everyone who wants to improve theirs email writing skill. Professor Merry Wanders is wonderful through the entire course with his lessons and tips. I consider this class as a must to all of them who wants to connect with the word of nowadays.
12854,Professor Andrew G is best ! Excellent material
12855,That a great course for the non-foundation people to learn.
12856,Excellent course on cosmology and philosophy. Great course material and additional for further reading.
12857,very good material for beginners
12858,Good basic course hard to get lost but does require some follow through if things are unfamiliar
12859,"excellent course, it combined the scientific basis of happiness as well as the practical tactics to pursuit it."
12860,"I love all those courses, I have learned so much and I'm planning to complete all 10 units."
12861,"Great course. Super case driven approach, professors are very clear."
12862,Awesome tips for getting the kiss involved in the kitchen as well as easy nutrition principles to follow.
12863,"It's a great course for people looking to garter an insight into the mystic world of machine learning. The pace of the course is excellent, allowing students from diverse background to follow along with reasonable effort."
12864,"Very helpful, Andrew makes it very clear and I really enjoy the class.Thank you so much!"
12865,A great introduction course. However the assignment are not challenging enough.
12866,"His was challenging, and gave a nice basis for the courses that followed. Spent easily twice as much time as the estimated given for the class. About 6-9 hours a week."
12867,His is the best of course I've been enrolled in! Perfect order of topics.
12868,"Perfect lecturer, I like the way of giving information, just perfect, and nice useful materials"
12869,"Like the previous two classes...learned a great deal at a pace that worked for my schedule. I would highly recommend this course, along with the previous courses in the series, to anyone who wants to learn about project management!"
12870,"I very much enjoyed the set of the course, that is the short introduction and then the discussion of different earthworks per theme. However, I must say that I expected the course to be more thorough in the discussion of the different themes and earthworks. I believe the course would benefit from a more in depth discussions of the earthworks. His could for example include more background information about the artist or a comparison of different pieces by the same artist to better understand the artists' views and development through history. Such additions would elevate the level of the course and also help identify certain themes and events that often recur in art. To conclude, it was a very enjoyable course that help grasp basic concepts of modern art."
12871,Excellent course. Thoroughly enjoyed it
12872,I really enjoyed this course. I learnt so much and I'm confident that I can go on from here to writing more complex patron programs.Thank you Or. Chuck.
12873,Great course. A good review of material I learned back in University a couple of year ago.
12874,"Quite simple. It could be more engaging.When downloading PDF sides, links in them should be clickable."
12875,Very clear
12876,"Easy, flexible and comprehensive way to learn a new subject. Highly recommended!"
12877,"The course content is very good and is must have if you missed that stuff in college. It reaches of algorithmic analysis so you know which algorithm is more efficient, gives some examples of cool technique and provides challenges to apply those technique.However, there are things that I hate about this course. First of all this is about forms. They are broken down into sessions and there are too little people on each session. Staff provides exactly zero help. Of you are stuck, you have no hope on these forms and will need to find help somewhere else.Programming assignment are great, they are relevant, interesting, challenging and the automatic grade system estimates not only if we get the correct answer but also the efficiency of our algorithm. There have been some problems in divide and conquer section though. I've been struggling with implementing binary search (which is quite a simple algorithm!) in JavaScript to pass the assignment for weeks. I've written and rewritten it in different ways, done hundreds of manual and automatic tests, posted on course forms (receiving zero answers) and have gotten the same error again and again. I was able to solve this only by twitching to Python. I am quite sure there is a mistake in the test case, which cost me hours and hours. Overall, the programming assignment are very time consuming and lack of support and not showing test cases make things worse.I do not like that we cannot see the test case where our program fails. Perhaps, if you could figure out a test case that might fail in your program that would make you a better programme but I felt more like it was wasting of our time. The main thing is to analyze the test case that fails and understand why, it will bring the same result without wasting time and feeding anger,Some lectures have a strong Russian accent, that is very distracting. It is not a lot of work to take some English pronunciation training before making a course, isn't it?Overall, I enrolled for the specialization and planned to buy it in full but bought only this course to start with. Now I am glad I did that because now I am not sure about buying the other courses and will look somewhere else first.Anyway, the creator of the course have done a great job, which is highly appreciated. I believe you can make this course much better by fixing the issues I pointed above."
12878,"Recent into, though it would be a lot more useful if the professor didn't use his Software and instead thought us implementation using patron/R which are used in most commercial applications"
12879,Excellent course! The lecture had an engaging style and gave plenty of very useful examples and anecdotes to illustrate points and keep one engaged. Very highly recommended!
12880,easy to understand. Thank you for sharing knowledge.
12881,useful course for me . thanks to my tutor
12882,Good course for biginner
12883,It is a course which gives a great head start to someone who wants to make a career in digital marketing. All the points are cohesively and neatly explained and are well substantiate by relevant examples which makes the course easy to comprehend.
12884,"it is an awesome course , with many information."
12885,I am really impressed with the opinion and examples from different scholars on each topic of each lesson of the week. His gives me a better grasp on understanding Research Methodology Clearer which I couldn't even attain when I was in my standardized college in Cambodia. I'd definitely recommend this course to my fellow and junior classmates who wish to study research.
12886,Great into. Really gave me confidence with the DAW.
12887,His course is totally worth your time. Professor G is brilliant and his teaching method is absolutely excellent. I really expect to take his real courses.
12888,"Vice standard introduction to patron. Courses were clean and exercises were good. In the whole, a good introduction"
12889,"Very good class, not only lecture,but the homework also very good ."
12890,"His course is awesome! To matter how hard it was, Or. Chuck is all explained in a simple way that everyone can understand. I recommend this course as mandatory reading for the data structure in Python !!! Tom :)"
12891,"Vice job but somewhat slow in presentation and lumbering. The playing on recording to other students for grades is way too cumbersome. Outside of the necessary download, recording, playback the course was presented well and scales and position playing were particularly helpful and clear. Position playing is not as easy as one might perceived and the Instructor did a commendable job evaporating and in particular explaining how the information can be used to be creative and improvised.The reason not a 5 is that the trading is cumbersome and time-consuming to set up"
12892,"I took this course as part of the Specialization. I wish I could put all the directors, was, and EVPs through this specialization. The tools, case studies, and resources alone make it worth the time and money."
12893,I am halfway through the course and absolutely loving it! His is my first interaction with the behind the scene stuff of Machine Learning and this course seems like the ideal way to demystify and make this accessible for everyone to make use of.
12894,All the topics are well described and explained and the programming assignment are very much of help. i enjoyed this course a lot.
12895,I really did want to take this course in a specialization mode. However I sample some of the course video in the different courses making this specialization and decided against it.In the course video we see no teacher or lecturer just pictures of people and power-point sides with a flat voice in the background reading the sides. In my opinion this does very little in making this topic interesting as it comes out flat and more work should have been put into making of this MOOC considering one has to pay for the specialization. There were also no discussion forms of any kind available. More work should be put into the making of the lecture video by the school to give it a realistic classroom experience.Unfortunately I dropped out of the MOOC because of the poor quality done by the school despite it being a topic of interest for me.
12896,"His is a great course. The teacher is very clear, and the material is very interesting. The programming assignment are interesting: the problems asked are very simple, but the input is generally too large to use brute force: you really have to implement the algorithms presented in the video. His makes you realize how much smart algorithms can make a difference.The level of the class is relatively high, compared to other Coursera courses I've taken. Of you want some serious training on algorithms, look no further."
12897,"Its a very information course, and It would have been better Of some in depth insight of FHIR and Fig Data Analytics and their mechanism at technical level was explained. Overall, Its been a great platform for beginners on Health Informatics, and it very well explained American healthcare module at a high level.Note: There were some spelling mistakes in sub-titles."
12898,"Although, this was my first time with patron, I was up and running with a few basic codes in as few as two classes. The instructor is amazing and I enjoyed this course. Thank you Prof. Severance and the Coursera team."
12899,"Useful, clear and simple. George Siedel is a great teacher."
12900,Very straightforward! I liked it.
12901,"the way this course was presented was quite unique: watching a few people from various walks of life (but most related to the University) discuss various topic and exchange opinion and experiences about positively.I liked the material provided for meditation about loving kindness and I have been using it on a daily (well 5 days a week) basis.why I gave only 3 stars:the material was overall rather shallow - after reading about positive psychology, I still very little substance it has to offer.in addition. Warfare is not the greatest and most charismatic speaker in the world, although she did surprise me in her TED talk.in general, human emotions are operating on a scale from positive to negative. Positive Psychology takes a one-sided approach by looking only on the plus side. That is about as incomplete as the approach of rousing only on the pathology. To fully grasp a human being, there must be a third way? is it philosophy?"
12902,His was an amazing experience. The way of teaching is scientifically beautiful. Moved it thoroughly!
12903,"The content is ample. The speaking pace is a little bit slow such that I chose to watch the video at speed of 1.six. It will be better if more examples can be presented especially for different processing approaches, algorithms or data structures."
12904,"Founder full, first time i deeply learn what is function, limit and the whole Calculus. i love it."
12905,"Excellent!I liked very much this course!Although i would prefer to have more courses like this in spanish that is my native language, or at least with spanish subtitles.Thanks!"
12906,Great Course . Thank you for the remarkable effort =)
12907,"Thorough, excellent coverage of the the subject. Well worth your time."
12908,very interesting
12909,Great course! Great explanations! Great examples! Great assignment!
12910,Very nice course!
12911,"Extremely clear presentations by the researches, but loses 2 stars for relying on assignment based on Google Docs which did not load properly and resulted in me not being able to complete the course."
12912,"Excellent Course and Well detailed lectures. For a beginner in Machine learning, i am able to understand the concepts clearly. Ruin and Assignment are really good and interesting. I am hoping to complete this mortification by new year"
12913,Excellent course as a graphics design practitioner and aid reader of typography books i still found plenty of new facts. Its very well thought through
12914,I had fun and learnt clot!
12915,"I enjoyed the learning experience on this course and will be putting this to good use in the future. Well put together, very good."
12916,Great and not difficulty. Have me a great approach what Responsive Design is.
12917,Very interesting course. Any examples of problems. Good lectures.
12918,awesome... thank for everything ! i learned a lot !
12919,Good introduction to of
12920,highly recommended!.
12921,It's an amazing introduction to algorithms. I enjoyed listening to the lectures. All the algorithms were explained in detail.
12922,To good without the missing course and capstone projects
12923,I liked very much the introductory video in different places and even having some of the students. Although I didn't had time yet to read the references is awesome to have them available before the beginning of the course. I also liked the way Professor Achilles reaches. Thanks very much.
12924,Great course! Great lecturer!
12925,His course was wonderful! I really loved to have the possibility to practice and learn this amazing language! Thank you very much to the teacher in charge. I really learned a lot!
12926,Thanks
12927,His course has impacted my storytelling in the best way! Moved it!
12928,Great basic learning for everyone.
12929,His course shows me how bad was my studying habits and help me to enhance it. There is so many good technique how to study and the explanation of neutral processes are'it missing. It's pretty useful course and Barbara Valley is very sympathetic person!
12930,In expensive survey with up-to-moment research into. Clears up many misconceptions about genetic engineering and bitch.
12931,"The course was great, however I think it should be more video content."
12932,Very impressive. Thanks
12933,One of the best introductory courses on machine learning.
12934,Will is really very helpful
12935,I recommend it to everyone.
12936,really help me in Business Writing in English
12937,Mind too slow in speed. But overall great
12938,Was been postponed for months and it's still only available for review
12939,"The tone of the course wasn't always to my liking (with the cartoons, animation, etc.) but there is some great advice in here, and I would encourage everyone to take the course. Garb's (the instructor's) personal background particularly resented with me: she is someone who entered Engineering, a very demanding field, without much science background, and had to adapt to many new and challenging ideas. I am contemplation a similar change, and it's comforting to know that it can be done."
12940,"Excellent course about personal work improvement, easy to follow , good material and very logic! already working with a work plan and a time management system"
12941,"Thank you for the course, it was very information!"
12942,Fascinating!!!
12943,"I feel this is way too hard for people who are not good at path, or haven't studies path for a long time. Took me longer time to figure all questions out."
12944,"good course, well thought through.some of the lectures didn't quite get the message across clearly and some of the assignment didn't quite measure what they intended, but overall i was much impressed, thanks."
12945,"Great assignment, lot of interesting stuff!"
12946,"Assignment up until the last one were relatively easy, which is the only criticism I have."
12947,"Awesome!!! I cannot believe that only a few weeks ago, I was an absolute novice, and now I am able to dig deep into live webster, drill deep, and extract specific information! Or. Chuck is one of the best instructor I have ever seen!!!"
12948,Really good into course to machine learning
12949,New concepts ! Great assignment ! and fantastic teachers !
12950,The faculty is really cool and has an excellent way of explaining concepts. Content is also practical and useful. I am enjoying the course very much.
12951,"A really excellent course, where I have learnt huge amounts. I'm going to really miss A too, he had a very natural way of presenting to the camera."
12952,"Couple hiccups with the autograder, but otherwise this course was very good. After missing around with HTML for years, it was about time I learned what the deal with HTML5 is. Must the right length, and definitely an Easy level of difficulty."
12953,"Of you want to have a clear map about marketing process especially marketing strategy, this MOOC is a must-have course."
12954,"Clear, easy to understand, very helpful."
12955,Thank you so much for getting me started on the path!
12956,"A good introduction to the subject. Folds your hand through the programming exercises, which is good for people with little background in programming."
12957,Recommended for entry-level young professional.
12958,I Thing this platform is provide complete knowledge about which kind of Course you wan
12959,Excelente approach. Teacher is very sucintelly.His course is first door to world programming
12960,Thank you for the opportunity provided. I am happy about the quality of it and of the lecturer too.
12961,"Hard and long but worth it! Very well organized, practical, and information..."
12962,It's being great to follow this course. It's inspiring me to learn how to play and to learn a little more by myself. Very complete course.
12963,A good course to start learning classification and getting exposure to algorithms. The instructor is awesome!!
12964,"Is all your courses, great! I have learnt a lot!"
12965,His is a great course - very useful and interesting. I can recommend it for sure and would like to thank its authors - they did a great job!
12966,Vice introduction for iss and html
12967,"Absolutely excellent principles, technique and outcome! A new world opened for me. Excellent! A truly rd-millennium course!"
12968,"There is much to praise: nice mapwork, a steady and organized march through time, and some interesting case studies (I especially enjoyed the lecture on Henry Adams).However, the title is a complete misnomer, as the course is regrettable white bread history. I found the approach stale and western-central, as the content actually covers western Europe and the stretch of its influence through the time period. I also found myself questioning the velocity of many conclusions, as the lecture often had difficulty biting more than a couple specific points of evidence for his arguments."
12969,His course is great for the basic fundamentals of project management. The presentation could have been a bit more engaging.
12970,really great introduction course
12971,nice course with a good instructor.
12972,Short but well put together with many additional external resources (reading)!
12973,Instructor is clearly reading off of cards or a prompter that doesn't face the camera so he's constantly not looking at you which is frustration. The feeling of each lesson being so scraped takes away from the feeling of a professor teaching material with which he is comfortable. Comparing this to of An Diego course video is like night and day and really makes you realize the importance of quality production/natural flow of teaching.
12974,"The neo parts were good, and nice introduction to graph terminology and concepts. would like to see detailed hands-on for we#5 (like we#4 had w/neo, which was very well done). like the tools survey and concepts. would like to see recommendations for other course(s), not necessarily in this series or by of SanDiego, about where to go for deeper path."
12975,its good to learn this subject free of cost and amazing teaching method.
12976,Steep learning curve. really taxed my thinking capacity. I enjoyed it thoroughly!
12977,Amazing course. I'd highly recommend it.
12978,Simply AMAZING!
12979,Sides still need editing a bit
12980,The philosophy course they should have taught my at the Cycle....
12981,His course really helped me throughout. I was totally new to programming especially to this computer science subject but this course has got me through. Now i can proceed with more understanding and skill. THANK YOU Coursera
12982,Moving this course. Yakov is both very entertaining and very good at explaining things. I'm enjoying every lecture and am learning a lot which is going to help me passively at my job.Thank you very much :)
12983,It is an excellent course for learning Cava.
12984,Fantastic course about a topic I knew very little about. Thanks so much.
12985,"A nice course for Python beginner or even Programming beginner, but not suitable for a professional developer, most of the concepts are too basic, the city lectures are complicate to me though."
12986,"good lectures and theory. I miss automatic code evaluation and more jump data transformation. I suck at these and I was hoping this course would have more of the same kind of tasks as the first + clotting.Overall, good class as a started point for clotting in hands."
12987,great and useful
12988,"Very methodical, but still makes writing fun... and exciting."
12989,"Course is really good, it covers a lot of different topics at once on a good level, so you can continue studying by yourself. Forms good understanding of machine learning. In my opinion one of the most important things is that the lecturer tries to explain each and every topic and not just give the ability to use it, there are a lot of step-by-step examples and additional explanation video. Programming assignment are also good, they cover a lot of material and give real examples. Definitely recommend this course. It's fun."
12990,"Hello,I've completed 5 nodules of the specialization successfully with excellent grades. However, the biggest challenge and disappointment was the capstone. The case given is pertaining exclusively to the North American market. Students unrolling into the course are situated locally which makes it extremely challenging to gather data to understand and substantiate our work on the project. Several hours of extensive research yields no unable data which could provide a logical direction to the project. Leading material provided explains mainly the company profile, a few links are blocked due to geographical restrictions, reports that are available are to be purchased etc. While the money invested is not refundable now, however course with university team needs to seriously resolve this point. All learning done through the course remains largely a theoretical knowledge if a student isn't able to apply it in his/her job."
12991,Great! course! The tips in the course helped me become more productive on a day to day basis.
12992,"His course was amazing, and I'm sad to see it go. It was interesting and full of new things that I have yet to learn and hopefully go more in-depth into during my university studies. I hope more people are informed about this course and I also hope that I still have access to the video lectures for future reference. Thank you for the experience!"
12993,"Would be better if it were a terrified course. Perhaps an optional exam after the course, for those who want the certificate.."
12994,"You are forced to do your own research and study as the instruction is light. However, ample tools are provided like CopePen which allows you to test and play. The forms are a great to see what the rest of your class is doing and saying. Good luck with the course :)"
12995,Excellent introduction to team culture for leaders. Understanding different cultures for business in a global stage is essential to build products and services that are true to the cultures of the origin and also destination.
12996,"The information is helpful and practical, but the recipe at the end with all that butter and eggs just do not correspond to the message of this course to eat mostly plants"
12997,"Great material, great course!"
12998,Although I have completed the course I still go back to it to listen to Prof. Bliss teachings.
12999,That's great. It is useful. The basic knowledge is simple and easy to study. I loves it.
13000,Learned some new stuff and it brought back joy and a new passion for food and cooking. Thank you! :)
13001,One of the best courses I've had the pleasure the be part of.
13002,Really good course. I have learned a lot.
13003,"His is my second course through the University of Albert. I did In 101 (which I highly recommend on its own or before the Paleontology series) and was so impressed. Ancient Marine Textiles is extremely in-depth - there is A LOT to learn here, from various animals to evolution, classification and trees. The instructor is absolutely phenomena! I love his teaching style: he kept me engaged, interested and learning with nearly every sentence. It is obvious that he loves the world of Paleontology and that makes him easy to learn from. I highly, highly recommend this course and any others from the University of Albert - they are some of the best courses I've ever taken."
13004,It was very helpful and pleasant lecture. I learned the many. To thank you very much for all lectures.
13005,"Not as much practical as the other Python courses provided in this series. The coming assignment is quite easy, since the code has been already written, the ONLY thing you have to do is RUN of..."
13006,It is a really good course for people who want to learn machine learning. I do love this class.
13007,Really great supplement while I was studying for the CAPM.
13008,Excellent!!!!!!!!i would like to take it again
13009,Professor Valley and Professor Sejnowski are great educators that made this course intriguing and information! I definitely learned a great deal about how the mind works and feel better prepared to tackle my learning goals.
13010,Good introduction. The rest of the specially is harder.
13011,"Initiating and Planning Projects course was a challenge match at the first view. After the second week I was confident to apply the knowledge that I have gained in my professional life. Even english has been a second language to me, the all materials that UCI offers help me a lot to understand concepts, tools and mainly the PMBok Guide. I recommend not only this course but also a complete specialization that UCI has been offering."
13012,"I think the difficulty of the course and progress is very suitable for beginners, you can see very attentively when producing, I looked up some information in learning, think that teacher is very clear. To this course I'm very satisfied, very happy!"
13013,Very information and interesting in-depth overview of the gene. The additional course resources (video and recording) are worth signing up by themselves. Highly recommend for anyone who's just getting into classical music.
13014,"I enjoyed the course. I wish there was perhaps a little more evaluation along the way (maybe occasional in-lecture questions), but otherwise very nice."
13015,awesome tutor!!
13016,"The course is really awesome. Of all the introductory Machine Learning courses I've taken, this is one is the best!"
13017,"I've done my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering in one of the best colleges in India, and yet this course makes me understand the roots of Material Science & Ogg. better than my 4 years spent in college."
13018,A must do course for those outside Europe
13019,lots of fun. great into on the evolution of dogs and how dogs learn.
13020,"I have been programming in R for years, but I did learn some new things in this course!"
13021,His is really helpful to me. :)
13022,It's a good course for machine learning beginner(s) and there're few samples that really worth to do a self-study or trial projects.
13023,"Moved this course,best so far from all data science ."
13024,"Informative, helpful with a lot of inside... It is worth taking!!"
13025,Excellent! A little harder for new students in patron but very interesting!
13026,Or. Chuck is so cool
13027,Content is very nice.
13028,I love It.
13029,"The introduction to functional reactive programming is well done. You go from the problem to the solution in a few lectures, and understand positive and negative aspects of the approach."
13030,I believe it would be very useful if the authors could provide a lecture review about patron commands. Specially the ones they are going to use during the course.
13031,Not new prospects and vision of Of printing teach
13032,"Covers a wide range of topics without looking transparent. In my opinion requires more work than the other courses, but is really worth a go. You end up having a firm basis for working with data and learning more about the process."
13033,"Awesome course, I have learnt so many new things here that is really very helpful in my career.Thank you.."
13034,Great course! very maker/open source sided :)
13035,Great course with a really good set!
13036,Great course to understand the basic elements of Marketing Analytics
13037,"His is course is really awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested to Software Engineering using JAVA programming Language.A little history about my background will help understand my excitement about this course. I am a newly graduated in the field of Electrical Engineering. To far, I wrote code mainly in C++ and I have not really participated to very challenging programming assignment. Looking for job (Luckily so far ) I quickly realize that Cava programming is really big on the job market. For these reasons, I got this book in Cava programming called ""Starting But with JAVA"", but may be due to lack of discipline I was not really able to move deeply in book.However since I have enrolled in this course, I am being influenced tremendous by the design of the class.I got so much positive vice from the professor who make this class really exciting. The level of details use in lecture video make this class really easy to follow. In addition, the class assignment are just plainly cool, practical, and challenging. I really feel like I am learning from expert in the field. His fact has raised my confidence that my gaining the skill combined in this specialization I signify my qualification on the job market.Thank you."
13038,"Good explanations and Or.Chuck makes the course fun. Exercises could probably be a bit more challenging, but it will do for absolute beginners. Thank you."
13039,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gazed the quires and projects.
13040,His is just a dream course for an entrepreneur. Their are lot of challenging topics calcified by wonderful examples.
13041,"Really enjoyed the course format, information presented and the video were fantastic. The discussions were lively and interesting as well . Had a great time learning about what may be the next big disaster heading our way!"
13042,"Great! Openminded and a place where you can learn things from different areas, such a geography, history o sociology... Feel done!"
13043,It is a great course!
13044,I love that
13045,I!I have done this course because I really wanted to get into the topic of terrorist and the history of terrorist. His course has given me great insight and Prof Baker is excellent at presenting the material and explaining the complex concepts.Thank you for this great course!
13046,Well worth the time spent!
13047,A good introduction to Organ language. I learnt to read the Organ letters. Need a lot of practice on conversation. Thanks for the lessons!
13048,Excellent teaching method of teaching with short information video :)
13049,so useful and interesting! Thanks for teaching me!
13050,"More concrete weekly assignment with less vague objectives, and more in-depth training materials would be better. Otherwise, a decent introductory course."
13051,The lecture materials are interesting and information. And the quires require an understanding of the material. I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot about genetic and evolution. Thank you again.
13052,"I found this course is very useful. It covers all of the important points of facing technology job interview, even including how to deal with psychological emotions and build strong growth midst."
13053,"Vice, easy to understand"
13054,Recommended for anyone
13055,A perfect course for anyone new to the Python language.
13056,"I enjoyed it very much! I've learned so much about presentation, eg. how to make an effective poster,PPT and handful for the talk, and how to use appropriate non-verbal technique, etc. I gained a lot from the process of accomplishing assignment, and it really illustrate the saying ""Learning by doing""."
13057,Its amazing learning phase for me.
13058,simple and effective way of teaching
13059,"To matter whether you know what Cryptography is, and if you don't know whether you like it, you'll find the answer after taking this course."
13060,"It is very information. It suggests some very good strategics for parents, teachers, para-educators and psychologist."
13061,Moved the course
13062,Vice and easy explanation clarifying all the concepts properly.
13063,"great course, lots of wonderful hands on material, excellent lectures."
13064,fantastic teacher
13065,"Wonderful course, after some time I will repeat.Thank you very much Prof. Chris Empty, you have given me much insight.He keep in touch, best regards, Mob"
13066,Great course!
13067,Fantastic course! Clearly explained and well animated.
13068,Excellent course. To doubt why this is the most successfully in the MOOC world
13069,"Excellent organisation of the course! The content is also well thought and presented. i personally calcified many vague questions related to variable, measurement and research ethics. I did have the quantitative methods course at the university, in any case some blank spots were left, so this course was helpful. It is a useful course for revising, but I do not know how total beginners feel about it. Of I were a beginner I would have some difficulties probably. It could relate to my personal ""slowness"" to grasp material like this.Thank you Annemarie! I really like your securing/teaching style."
13070,"Very general but it shows the basis of finance. I wish it would had been a little more deep, but it shows what's necessary."
13071,Thank you for your teaching!
13072,Perfect! The teacher is really
13073,His is a wonderful course for anybody to camp up their programming skill right from scratch. His gives enough confidence to take on further programming tasks.
13074,Very information
13075,Good course!
13076,very good comprehensive Global Health MOOC
13077,"The course is uneven at best, with some nodules providing insight and knowledge and others not so much. The presentation in some of the nodules is perhaps an example of how not to do it, reading fro a script in a monotonous voice. Some of the material, like the lengthy historical review of Edinburgh's met school, might be good advertising and interesting, but does not fall under the scope of 'what it takes to be a met'. Good idea, but, with a few exceptions, less than average execution."
13078,"Good into, needs more coverage of Austrian Economics and examples of how to do some of the economic analysis"
13079,Great course
13080,"Well designed and executed in the main. Is video are recorded once but viewed thousands of times it would have been nice if they had taken more time to write a script and look more professional - also mistakes in the video that don't match the current material are few, but very annoying."
13081,A very good course but it was a little narrow because it focused on the professor's own research. Perhaps one or two lectures on other tends ad research results from the wider field of positive psychology would be apt.
13082,A good mix between theory and practical programming exercises.
13083,"Except the fact that it was taught well, I believe that pressing people work with a specific program to pass a course is not helpful. I believe that instead of learning how to handle PRO TOOLS from scratch you should change the course to something more creative like recording different instruments, measuring the studio space, monitor and much more helpful things than advertise and make AVID richer.FriendlyAll the best"
13084,His course was an excellent way to begin immersing myself into the specialization. I am new to this field but can imagine myself using much of my printed out material as future reference
13085,"Very good introduction to this software, teacher is great and very easy to understand. I have learned a lot of good stuffs such as how to warp audit, convert audit to mid and so on... I was used to work on case and I have discovered the specifities and the advantages of Give.Moreover thanks to the assignment objectives I had to force myself to be creative and It was a great feeling.Thanks for this course :)"
13086,Very information course.
13087,Prefect course
13088,"Moved the lecture and materials. However, the course need more ACTIVE teaching staff and senators. I had several questions regarding the materials but could not get any help from start to the end. It was the only specialization course that I had to move on without complete understanding of the materials."
13089,Excellent course if you want to learn patron as a beginner. Oats off to the team who is worked hard to put up this course.
13090,"Without doubt, I recommend this course because it summarize a lot of things that you should know about writing."
13091,Very useful course. Great tutors.
13092,best online course .. this course helped me to find what I love and what I should find career in.
13093,His course helped me learn the basis of the Organ language in an entertaining way. 10/10 recommend!
13094,Thank you very much. It has been interesting experience.
13095,His course's material is really handy for t
13096,Good for new learner.
13097,Great challenging class. His course class has so much information packed into it that I download the transcripts! Professor Garden provides a strong academic thesis and then miles it up with continual real world experiences and cases. I loved this class. I also became a better writer!
13098,Thank you. It was a very interesting and course and I learned quite a few things which are very useful.
13099,The course is great. I learned a lot about popularity and the affects on adults. It would be even better if their were some whitepapers or books added to the course.
13100,Prof. G explains everything super clear. He focused much more on conceptual understanding than detailed mathematical deviations. All the MATLAB/Active exercises are interesting and relevant. The best part is that all the peripheral coming is provided and one only needs to focus on implementing machine learning related core functions. Overall an excellent introductory course.
13101,His is one of the best courses I ever had
13102,His is really a good course!
13103,"Interesting, information, and engaging."
13104,"His is great, professors are awesome and quality of material is great. I loved it and I highly recommend this course!"
13105,The was the most enlightening course about learning how and when to focus among other things.I loved every minute of it. Thank you so much.
13106,Very Good Course! Yakov is a great teacher - all is very interesting and easy to understand.
13107,it was very helpful and very beneficial thanks a lot for the way you're considering your effort to help the student like me
13108,"His is a great course that moves at a nice pace and allows students to experience SQL two different platforms (Jupiter, Teradata) with two different but interesting data sets. The video are great but as with all programming the key is to practice, practice, practice! Which there is plenty of opportunity for also. Highly recommend."
13109,It's a great course. Teachers are awesome since they're capable of getting your attention 100% of the time by keeping motivation up and making the learning curve really smooth. Thanks!
13110,"The teacher is explaining the basis of the language very well. By only issue was that he was a bit too slow for me at times, making me skin ahead. Looks like he's going on long detail to help students who have never programme, but for those who have some experience it can be tedious."
13111,"Excellent course that is both well presented and very clear, providing many examples and opportunities to practice throughout the course."
13112,"Awesome course, the concepts are explained with a great level of simplicity. Sides are excellency plotted. I recommend this course to every of professional."
13113,"I really enjoyed this course! The instructor kept things interesting and covered a lot of topics in a concise way. I wish there were more chloral examples -- as in examples I could watch in action, not just hearing someone talk about it -- but otherwise I thought it was great. I will definitely use a lot of the things I learned here with my own resemble."
13114,Really cool!
13115,Very well prepared course material with awesome teachings by Professor..Great job!!!
13116,"I believe that the teacher creates a great way of explaining what seems to be very complicated thought processes, and he does so in a highly enthusiastic manner.The only downside is that such explanations can be either too low level or not strong enough to explain certain phenomena. For example, the professor talks about how the absolute value function of x is not differential at zero, and how a function is differential at a certain point when the two-sided limit exists and, by extension, the function is continuous at that same given point. However, the professor in this regard never truly explains why the v-shape is not differential and how it relates to our definition of continuity. However, overall: a very worthwhile course and a pleasant experience."
13117,"His course was just amazing! A proper and a brief description is given in each and every lesson of the course. People, those who are very new to photography can find this thing very much interesting. By fascination towards photography has doubled! I thank both the professors for their teachings."
13118,sir you are best .. i learnt so much from you and i really appreciate your work for students
13119,Grin Area is awesome..!!! Really good course to get up to speed with alton.
13120,I have found really useful the technique that are mentioned though the course. Thanks for sharing your knowledge!!
13121,It was a great course!!!
13122,"That course describes the challenges of society, economy and environment face and provides solutions through the sustainable development ."
13123,Good course but the programming exercises didn't run with the new version of Active without some changes.
13124,His is a very good course!
13125,"I really like the course, all the information presentment.I think it can be better if there was some test, because sometimes it gets too easy."
13126,Great course! :)
13127,I learned clot. And I thank our teacher for motivation us not to give up and practise as much as we can .
13128,I learnt a lot and it was really fun
13129,Easily understandable for new program
13130,"In general, I enjoyed the contents of the course. It's a general overview that introduces all aspects of Cutis Spectrum Disorder which is exactly what I wanted. However, half of the final week is a list of established and emerging practices, so this was quite boring. I could have read them off the screen faster.By least favorite aspect of this course is that you can't take the quires without buying the certificate. Currently, the certificate won't assist me; I simply wanted to learn more about ASD so as to be more informed. His was quite frustration because I use the quires as a means of checking my understanding and retention of the material."
13131,"His is a great course, I recommend it especially for people who want to improve their learning skill and to increase their productivity, the teachers explain the concepts very clearly, and in a way that is very easy to understand!"
13132,easy to get start with patron
13133,"I enrolled this course last year and quit at week 3. But I finished it this time and it's the first of MOOC I finished. It's a really hard but really youthful six-week. It led me into the world of algorithm and helped me improved my English a lot.Thanks to Sedgwick's gorgeous lectures, Hayne's patient answers at Discuss forum and every fellows participate this course."
13134,Great Course..It will cover all the basic concepts of tireless communications with in a small time.thank you for team & Coursera for keeping this course online.
13135,Great course with excellent learning material and clear explanations. I learnt a lot and would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in astrobiology and the search for life outside of our planet.
13136,Learning very much.
13137,Very good specially for bilinguals. Moved the real life situations\examples.
13138,I got exactly what i expected from this course - great starting point on my journey to master Python. Thank you professor Campbell and professor Cries and thank you all others who were involved in creating this course whose names we don't know.
13139,The lectures did not prepare for quires/assignment. Not a class for beginners.It would be better if he used R while securing instead of just talking through the whole lecture.I got more out of the will tutorials than I did the lectures.
13140,Of you love moves and psychology this course mixed both great
13141,"His course was an improvement in teaching morality from the statistical inference course, with more polished content, but the link between the lectures and the actual exercises was still a bit strained. Overall, it felt like there was a bit of a discontent between the will exercises and the lectures, and this led to a lot of self-teaching."
13142,Good introduction
13143,"There wasn't a list of suggested Leading, but It is really motivation to make the difference in bus"
13144,Good introductory course pointing to background reading materials and providing context for following courses as well as supporting the installation of the required software tools.
13145,You should take it! I learned a lot in each topic and also enjoyed it!
13146,Now ! too good course. Really enjoyed and learned a lot in this course. Thanks to the educators who took up this course and made it available world wide. Thanks
13147,"Good but not the best, the reason because one star is missing above is lake of home works I've got. Programming is something that you should practice practise and once more practice, otherwise the knowledge you got will disappear soon. To I would suggest to push people even more 2-4 hours and as a minimum double the home works."
13148,"MUY INTERESANTE, SALUDOS of PROFESOR Y AGRADECIMIENTOS POR COMPARTIR CON NOSOTROS MUY BIEN EXPLICADO. GRACIAS"
13149,It was nice to have Prof Danthine speaking as well - added an interesting perspective.
13150,"His is a very basic course. Of you are already a software engineer you could room through this entire course in an evening. Of you are not a software engineer and don't know what things like github are, this class could be useful."
13151,"Great class, but I wish there were more practice problems. Statistics is a very important concept to learn for any field, and I highly recommend this class."
13152,"Illuminating very interesting connections between modern psychology and the philosophy of buddhist. The essentials interpretation the buddhist concept of emptiness was novel to me.Very lucid and pedagogical lecturer. Sometimes it was a bit repetition and slow, but since one can watch in 1.x speed it didn't really bother me."
13153,"Very insightfull, but gets redundant in the end (last 2-3 Courses)"
13154,"I really enjoyed this course; it's applicable to most aspects of your life. It gave me some perspective into past negotiations, and how I could make the next negotiation (whatever it is) in my life better."
13155,it is an some coursethank you
13156,His course is really good for patron beginners.
13157,Awesome and must take course!!
13158,Very good and challenging!!!
13159,Good content that helpful for your other studies
13160,"To first of all, the material for this course in the bookdown document are very good - well structures, with good sources. By concern is that the Coursera course does not go a lot beyond, basically just referring to the document and adding quires + grade assignment in the last week. The assignment, however, is nice and challenging and requires people to understand the materials.Also, the course covers other great packages than ggplot2, e.g. slowly and leaflet and methods for handling spatial data. I think it would be very nice if the students were challenged in these topics as well and evaluate them in a better way than just a quit (programming assignment for instance).I liked the course though and I believe it can be prepared even better."
13161,His is a great overview of the Cava programming language as far as I can tell. I have prior Cava experience and I was interested in Android specific aspects of the language.
13162,Good course.
13163,"thanks,"
13164,"Great introduction to CSS3! The teaching is engaging and easy to understand. Assignment let you get hands-on and solidity what you've just learnt. Furthermore, peer-trading of assignment means you might pick up some things you weren't aware of. And there is a real sense of achievement by the end of the course."
13165,"You need a little more experience in coming that just the first course, or try not to leave everything by the end of the week(as I did) to find what you need for the assignment. Great course !"
13166,"Fascinating, useful"
13167,Excellent course and teacher. Congratulations!
13168,Excellent! The one every Coursera-er should take!
13169,"Sometimes it felt too fast paced, still I enjoyed it."
13170,"Very good and interesting course. The assignment could have been a little more difficult for me, but it was good the they made you think about how you can improve yourself and how you can help others. Also reading each others assignment was really helpful and inspiring."
13171,Very easy to follow and understand.
13172,"Run, hands-on and very interesting! Moved the assignment and the layout of the course."
13173,really good teacher and video :)
13174,Thank you for the opportunity to learn about HTML CSS and JavaScript.I wish you all the best!!!
13175,"Great course, really useful for any new topic you would like to study. Funny written, with relevant examples. Also, the optional video help a lot in understanding the practical approach and results of applying the course's theory."
13176,I like the course. It helped me a lot in structuring my knowledge about email' business communication.
13177,It was very interesting and of great relevance to many aspect of my fields of interest. They even had a special lecture on the philosophy of time travel that was a cherry on top of the cake!
13178,I would've saved a lot of time by knowing the R commands used in this course. It took so long to figure out things and I I didn't like the course because of that.
13179,"The video lectures are information. Is a student, I am also expecting to see its applications in various fields with sample codes if possible to practice the theory."
13180,"The course is excellent, but there is mistakes in quit and the forum participation is null. Professor nor your staff reply the forms."
13181,"Really great course. Easy to learn even though it touches some difficult subjects; the exercises have a medium difficulty, but they are easy to complete using the provided information; and the lectures are very complete yet fun to watch. In excellent introduction to the field of Machine Learning."
13182,"Helpful introductory, but should place more emphasis on the vols you could use to perform SEO Asks."
13183,"Really good course. The teachers are cool, I like them a lot :)"
13184,"good,but too easy"
13185,I just starting but the I feel this is donna be awesome course!
13186,Very good information
13187,"His capstone project helped me to design a pilot project plan for one of my dream projects. From this experience, I would be able to develop further, my knowledge in project charter planning and designing"
13188,"High fluidity lessons and a lot of content and advises, orientation, concepts compared in a perfect way. High value knowledge for a manager or operational position."
13189,"great course,great teacher, I've learned a lot"
13190,I really enjoyed this First Course. I think it will help clot with my work and my own business..
13191,"His is the best course of its kind. Need more such courses from Stanford. Daniel's lectures are amazing , It truly felt like he was sitting next to me and teaching. More from Daniel please"
13192,"To me, this is by far the best course in the series. It deals with the scientific foundation of how to do data science: repression models, residual, measures of the quality of the prediction, etc. The teacher is clearly a mathematician and has an academic style of presenting. He is very clear and chooses the subject in a clever way. One always understands what he or she is doing.Highly recommended. It doesn't get five stars only because it covers only the basis; I would have really liked it to last twice as much!"
13193,the best
13194,The course
13195,"Provides practical and applicable insight into how the physiology of the brain imparts learning. You learn what the brain is doing when you study, and how to minimize your study time. His course greatly aided my retention and understanding for my comprehensive exam in law. Strongly recommended for anyone interested in learning, whether in path, science, humanities, or law."
13196,"A very good course, i liked very much the examples used, i do wish there where some practical exercises."
13197,It is a very good course with book. The only think is I would like to have a more complex exercises. Most of them are just to modify some given code
13198,May too basic. Questionable since of humor.
13199,Very good class
13200,"Unlike the other courses, the material was quite new. And the video were shorter than the first one. The assignment were also quite simple too"
13201,great into for is and front end derbies
13202,It's one of the best online courses I've ever taken.
13203,His course is perfect for novices. Dan Beget is a great teacher; I look forward to participate in another course lectures by him.
13204,"His is one of the best management/leadership courses I have ever taken. The material is very creative and helps increase our attention span. By favorite part is learning from the additional resource/links posted (TED talks, couture links, etc). They are very interesting and I learnt so much in so little time. Deep up the good work."
13205,"With the understanding that this course is focused on how to develop a d game in Unity, it is a great course. The material is presented in a way that helps understanding.His is not an introduction to Same Development in general terms, it does not cover game design or other aspects of producing a game. There are other courses that cover these design aspects."
13206,"Simply and clearly explained, good examples. Must what you need for a short review of the topic."
13207,A great continuation course to learn functional programming in Scala. Thank you very much Professor Odersky!
13208,Really nice
13209,Amazing course! Really helpful for people wanting to get in touch with new web development technique.
13210,"Moved this course. I am not an entrepreneur yet, but I loved the energy of the professor and all the amazing people he had interview during the course. I learned a lot from this class, so thank you very much."
13211,"His is a very good course,this results in Professor Yakov Chaikin who has a great training plan.Thank you,Professor Yakov Chaikin!!!"
13212,Great basis of patron and coming. Great Material.
13213,Great content and clear explanations for a better understanding of the topic. I found very useful all the assignment to deepen my learning.
13214,"Very very good, The course is so interesting and has no boring spots."
13215,"The Course is very Practical, Enlightening and Resourceful"
13216,"Is a course very interesting, and have a good system learning"
13217,"Amazing Course, reaches you right from basis. Prof. G explains everything in a manner which makes it easy to understand. Only one shortcomings I found in this course is, not challenging enough programming exercises. I understand that course has to cater a general and large crowd, but adding maybe a few optional challenging exercises might help. Also, if optional video content is provided for algorithms which have been taught in CS229 but are absent here, it will be really useful."
13218,There is not much of a relation between what the course gives (explains with the video and with the SWIRL exercises) and the real exercises they ask to. Too difficult to follow by people new in the programming area.
13219,"The content covered in this course is great. However, I hope there was a more efficient way to communicate with student. I hope there is a way to bring student together like a group chat function in the course pp. To, people who want to be more committed can communicate more often and efficient."
13220,"His was a very interesting course that brings together different and unexpected sources and ties them with Tolkien's classic narrative in ways that help you gain new perspective on LOTR, but also on modern and classic works of art, books, games."
13221,short veins and good ma
13222,"Simple, practical, and interactive approach. The faculty is an experienced instructor, making coming looks simple and easy."
13223,The speech is clear and inspiring. His is a cool course.
13224,"The technical support of this course is just terrible: just like many many other students (see the Discussion forms), I have experienced serious difficulties to access the database platforms we need to learn and to complete our assignment. I can only echo the innumerable complains from my co-students about the lack of efficient support and technical reliability of this course; many of us are very unhappy about this, especially as they have paid for this course ... and what is Coursera doing about it, by the way?By advice: beware before unrolling in this course and even in this entire specialization, and search for alternative option (there are many, not only on Coursera but also on do and others ...)!!!"
13225,Great to start with.
13226,"Highly information and clears many misconceptions about food.Bottom line of the course: ""Avoid processes foods"""
13227,"His helps a lot to learn about Functional Programming and improve my Scala skill.BTW, I find repulsion is interesting and it changes my mind about coming."
13228,Professor is clear. He taught us specific ideas to be precise and professional.
13229,"Awesome instructor, visualization, concepts and materials!!!"
13230,Amazing Course. Very well planned. Love the professor :)
13231,"His course is an excellent introduction to financial markets. Everything is explained clearly and concisely. Though it would be nice if foreign exchange markets could also be covered. All in all, excellent course. Thank you!"
13232,"His was one of the best training in this area that I have ever done in my life.I am very grateful to the University of Minnesota for the opportunity and initiative, as well as the developer of the course who are able to disseminate knowledge on a global scale.A huge congratulations to all."
13233,+ Solemn is a good and funny teacher;+ video are easily to understand also for not english native speakers;+ I learned some things and tricks despite the fact that I am already using CSS3 in my daily work.- in my opinion it is necessary to have some experience with CSS before joining this course.Commitment: I needed about 10 hours/week of study
13234,Great course!
13235,The course offers a good mix of media used for the lectures. The book that accompanies the course is worth reading. The assessment and quires are good to handle when completing all lectures and reading.The course requires some pre knowledge.
13236,I HAD of EASY TIME WITH THE ACCESS AND COURSE MATERIALS
13237,Very good course!
13238,"Great course, great instructor, was hard, but the community of earners was fantastic and helped out a lot. Face is face, be ready to commit time to it."
13239,"It was a very interesting experience! Great authors and professors. I learned a lot and I hope this platform will help people to increase their photographic culture, like it did to me!! Enjoy the course!"
13240,"Easy to follow in most cases, great coming exercises and outstanding organization of the contents delivered. Highly recommended."
13241,Very good course.
13242,Is all their courses this one is great!
13243,A very good course because of its content and its professor. Thank you for your help.
13244,"His course was a great reap in path/statistics that I had totally forgotten about. Things were explained clearly, and the application of concepts was practical"
13245,"easy learning,understanding.."
13246,"Absolutely a fantastic and brilliant experience, one in which I would recommend to anyone choosing a history, archaeology, anthropology or anatomy related career path. I learned so much and gained both a new insight in studying the human anatomy and a new interest in what I would like to study further for my career."
13247,Great introduction to Python and the concepts of programming.
13248,A little too basic but it was a good class. Thanks!
13249,Very good content and essentially methodology of applying the knowledge learnt in real life cases
13250,Really fantastic even as an experienced R user. His is helping me removed my habits and break some of the bad ones. Thank you so much!
13251,"Great course. Learned a lot and the subjects where explained very well. of and Tax are kind of difficult to grasp when you are not a full computer science person, and although some previous knowledge is assumed and fair to be expected, it still would be nice if there could be a bit more of an introduction to them, for the less navvy out there. But overall, great course, easy to follow, with a nice real world example and peer-reviewed assignment."
13252,"Prof Andrew G's teaching style and delivery makes it easy to understand difficult concepts. The course material and assignment were neither too simplistic nor too complicated. It was a perfect introduction to machine learning, enabling you to take courses on more advanced topics in of & of."
13253,I like the teachers
13254,Great course
13255,"I absolutely loved the course, it was tough at the beginning but the teacher gives you examples and makes observations on the pronunciation and repeatedly reminds you how to pronounce the words. To that really helps your ear to open to the different sounds and bowels, and you get better with every assignment. Also the extra exercises helps you to get a better understanding of the Chinese culture, weather, food, etc."
13256,very helpful!
13257,It seems that all these types the course is based on are not quite scientifically prove. Also the materials are very pro-american culture like this link http://mentalfloss.com/article/65218/10-eyes-brings-type-charts-pop-culture-characters Not very helpful and inclusive.
13258,The project is very helpful to understand the course material
13259,Very interesting and easy to follow.
13260,"I learned some great technique in this course, one in particular is to the 80/20 rule. Language teachers should allow earners to talk more, and teachers talk less! By only drawback is that I could not see my own responses to Essential Questions or feedback from my peers."
13261,The teacher guided us to the basic of game world design. Give us the material of how to design the game world.
13262,"His course is interesting and easy to follow. I was aware of his work through some of the articles he mentions throughout the course and would especially suggest this course as potentially interesting to people who have been reading some of the scientific literature (including Or. Are's publications). Well done, I would take a follow up course any time."
13263,"such a great course!!Thank you so much, A"
13264,"A nice introduction to accounting, giving understanding of basis. Thanks a lot to mister Hoffman!"
13265,Very well designed class by 3 great professors!
13266,The mock interviews are helpful
13267,The materials were interesting and relevant. The instructions for the final project were a bit cystic - it was not completely clear what the instructor wanted. The submission I reviewed were all over the board and none came close to the trading public
13268,Wonderful course where you can really and honestly evaluate yourself !
13269,"Learned a lot. Not me started and using the program, and making music."
13270,His course introduced me to machine learning as well as made me master several machine learning algorithms through self-implementation. The course structure is very well organised and easy to follow. Assignment are well designed to let students master the concepts rather than spend time on debugging software issues.
13271,"A very lightweight into to HTML, CSS, Javascript, jury and a dash of Boostrap. The instructor barely introduce the topics, and then point out that we don't need them, we can just ""Google or Yahoo"" for the information.Of you just need a shove to get you moving down a path, this might be helpful, or if you are brand new to HTML, this would be a relatively painless way to check it out. I'm just not sure there is enough hand holding over the difficult bits for someone brand new to coming. The materials are pretty spare and there is not much structure.All four weeks are available at the onset of the class and the entire class can be completed in a weekend."
13272,His is a fantastic course with lot of hands on programming applications.
13273,Great course!
13274,"The course materials are great, but the Expel video and its background andros are poor, it need update to compare with characters video."
13275,"Excellent best online course ever, very didactic an fun. It motivate you to continue learning and complete the course"
13276,Interesting
13277,Excellent course with lot of insight to Database Management System.
13278,Great course with strong material on how to create an excellent presentation and use Tableaux.
13279,great course with a great instructor :)
13280,I love this course!! It helped me a lot! He are using all the information given and applying it in our kitchen. It would be great to have more courses like this.He´re creating new habits in our family. Thank you May for sharing.
13281,"It is my first time studying HTML, and this lecture has been a big help for me to start coming."
13282,A very well designed course. I would recommend to anyone with serious goals on learning repression and machine learning.
13283,Very useful and well explained.
13284,I love this course. Very specific. With tons of practical information. Good examples.
13285,His course is taught in a way that is easy to understand and gives lots of insight and examples to further solidity the knowledge presented.
13286,"I found this to be an excellent course, great new insight for me combined with necessary refreshed. Well worth the time!"
13287,"Outstanding Course!!!Everybody must take it, from daily to weekly and weekly to monthly to get the things done by following simple and straightforward activities."
13288,"These courses are great introduction to patron functionality. The workload is much more reasonable at 1-2 hours per week than many other Coursera courses that I have taken.By only recommendation is to show more current libraries and methods than those presented in the lectures. Fundamentals are important to understanding concepts, but if there are newer and better ways of doing things, they should be presented as well."
13289,I really love this course and it is
13290,"Before I began this course, I had only a very general knowledge of Buddhist meditation. After going through a number of lessons, I realized I really knew less than I thought. I had only been attracted to the Buddhist world encountered in reading and travels. For many years, it was something that I wanted to know more about. To I appreciate having access to this course.Classification and organization of detailed and complex material is well organized. Great work passing and presenting knowledge of contemplative practices.I feel there was some repetition or redundancy, but in my case that was not necessarily a bad thing, other than to add to the mass of information being delivered. The repetition helped to stability my memory and helped to establish a vaseline of concepts from which to build my understanding.I became mixed in detail, but absorbed as much as I could in lieu of being able to recall consciously specific pieces of information. I don't want to judge the presented by suggesting that they tried to put too much information into too little of a space. I found my efforts to absorb the into meditative in nature, thus I welcomed the challenge.The video of presented reading texts of detailed and dense into was difficult to follow at times, but I discovered that it helps, in some cases, to download the script of the talks and follow along with the video as I read the script.The focus on history and historical debates and conflicts between shamatha and vipassana practices, etc., within Buddhist were helpful but not as key as the meditation practices. I suppose it is difficult to separate them since they are so entailed.I have learned a lot more than I ever expected when I began this course.I value discussions and sharing among students, but the course is so dense and time consuming that I had no time left to participate in sharing with others. Not to value the into itself, which is fantastic."
13291,Quality and length of material is mediocre.
13292,"I enjoyed the course but quite frankly, it was very basic."
13293,"very nice soft start into programming, for someone who has some background would not be challenging but encourage them to continue through this specialization where it will be more challenging through the specialization"
13294,Overall good introduction to business concepts.
13295,The video are so long in time and not very clear.
13296,"Thank you to University of Michigan and its professors Scott venue and Maxim Watch. His has been one of the best online courses I have ever attended. The course brings into picture a lot of ideas and strategics to help evaluate, develop and motivate your tears."
13297,"His is a great introduction to machine learning algorithm. Right machine learning algorithms are covered during this 11-week course, including special use cases, advice for building machine learning system, and of course quires and exercises assignment. In order to follow this course, you will need, at a minimum, a basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus. Thanks to Professor Andrew G for making a quiet complex subject a real breeze."
13298,A really nice course for the started of the of also
13299,awesomethank's for this course
13300,very slow and boring. needs better and more relevant examples. Instruction should be more fast paced.
13301,"Great course, easy to understand but profound in content!"
13302,Good course.
13303,"In general I liked the course and content! However, some cases studies should be updated. The digital world changes dramatically fast and the course must follow it. He always expect to learn the latest trend and current examples."
13304,"Only able to audit the class, no longer able to take quires and tests. I recommend the Python classes from Michigan over these if you are looking to avoid paying for old material."
13305,Very interesting and well done course packed with very useful resources.
13306,thanks for help me for learning patron programming
13307,Suitable for high school students. For a University student it can be easily finished in 1-2 days.
13308,Absolutely amazing course.
13309,Good course
13310,"Excellent Course, content would be really helpful in managing my time in future."
13311,Step-by-step way of teaching method.
13312,"I have learned an amazing amount about Hands and how powerful it is for Data Science, Thanks Peter"
13313,WoWIt was an amazing course. It gave me lots of ideas.It could have had a text book as a reference.Recommended. :)
13314,"great course, easy to understand!"
13315,West science-based course about learning methodology.
13316,Adorable Prof and great class
13317,"Lots of unnecessary information included in each video which make them long and boring. Number and length of video in each week are too much while the ""practical"" information you get are not enough!"
13318,"Great Introduction, great assignment"
13319,Fascinating and a quite information course.
13320,To much interesting. Met me improve my own knowledge about the structure and function of the brain and I might to say that I am a neuro lover jejejj
13321,To far the best course on the topic.
13322,Good explanation
13323,Great review course for those in medical school or have been in practice for awhile. The surgery module was particularly interesting!
13324,"should be open to anyone. But is ok, you can still her knowledge without paying"
13325,Awesome Course. Very apt for beginners. Structures approach which makes clear the purpose of each elements in a code
13326,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course and it inspires me to do more to help the our Earth's future. I hope to be able to spread the word of science to others so that they can begin to make a difference. Great video and explanations of some things I wasn't aware of til now. Maybe adding a what if scenario and how we could fix the issue or help would be a great assignment to add, covering everything we had gone over. But overall, thank you for a well informed course with so many links of information.[I have many of them saved in my footmarks :-) ]"
13327,"Excellent, very amusing professor!"
13328,"Excellent course with an excellent teacher, I had a hard time completing the last assessment but I finally did it by my own! That's what I like the most of this course, that for people like me who are not used to programming, it turns out to be challenging yet it leaves you with a great satisfaction when completed."
13329,It is a really good course which tells us about the history of technologies that we use now as well the technologies used behind them. Meeting with geniuses who helped create the technologies is a bonus
13330,A well organized course from basis of biodiversity to the field requirements; it has covered the necessary methodologies. It was very useful. Special Thanks to Or. Robert Cazzolla Anti of NRTS University; who was the backbone of the course.
13331,"I simply LOVED this course, it was well organized and perfectly prepared..Thank you very much for this wonderful course."
13332,A wonderful course which provides complete grasp of the global challenge called diabetes. The video are very lucid and every tutor give their lecture to the point. Lectures are down to earth. They are all very short and sweet (non-diabetic!). I would recommend it to any one.
13333,Good course.
13334,It`s helpful!
13335,Good motivation lectures and I felt I made significant progress.
13336,Interesting introduction in the Business Strategy.
13337,"Vice flow of the material, very engaging professor, appropriate assignment."
13338,The course is perfect. The assignment and trading are not well developed.
13339,Moved it
13340,"Not being an historian on the Middle Ages, Magic in the Middle Ages seems like an accurate and well planned course. Week-4 and week-5 were the most interesting, with week-5 delving into the knitted relationship of magic in Slam, with roots and lineage directly connected to contemporary practices of ""magic"" (which is something I did not know and was very curious about regarding the context of political and religious tension revolving throughout the middle east). I would have liked more activity-based and practical instructions units on how magic and rituals were conducted, especially information on healing, medicines, and archery. Yeomanry was the only practical component with explicit details on how to cast figures, and it needed to incorporate how it was used with astronomy in a practical way. A unit on Astrology and the Astrolabe was needed as well since the video and literature often referred to astronomy, and without a basic working and understanding of how an astrolabe was used to calculate a chart, the student is left hanging on having to figure way too much on their own (which becomes rife with problems and miscommunication). The quires and assignment are fun but often awkwardly worded which became confusing, and can easily be created on. Trading of assignment was a bit nebulous and put into question others abilities to accurately and fairly grade. People paying money for course content should be separated from students not paying because engaging, stimulating, and critical analysis as discourse cannot be maintained in fidelity. Of course, the credibility of ALL courses on Coursera are at stake because little to no universities and business accept the certificates as valid credentials for jobs or career ladder mobility. Ultimately, one is paying for a piece of paper that is not really valued or even unable at the very same institutes that put together the coursework; and that is a very lame proposition! The final kicked is that I needed to submit highly sensitive, personal identification just to get a PDF of the certificate--absolutely ridiculous, especially considering that the topic of interest for this course neither necessitates nor warrants such high-end secure methods."
13341,"Course materials are a little bit obvious, but I really like the original version of The Shorter and Lane's personality"
13342,Amazing course! Thanks to Prof. Andrew
13343,Great!
13344,"Very useful course, highly recommend!"
13345,"i recommend this course , an excellent introduction for an aspirin writer or anyone interested in literature as it explains and decomposes thoroughly the mechanics of plot , thou very alive ideas and sharing of experienced writers , i enjoyed the submission which taught me discipline and structure . His experience helped broaden my horizon , i learned a lot from the peer review also , this first module convinced me to go on and complete the full course. Thank you"
13346,A great course about professional email writing.
13347,I liked the course a lot.
13348,Thanks It was great experience to go through the course.
13349,To easy
13350,"I learned really useful things about software project/product management and I hope to use these concepts to get a full-time role. The capstone was really intensive and there were a lot of assignment, but you will get to go through what happens during splints."
13351,His course is very good for all. if we start practicing by noting daily achieving we can win .
13352,Instructor is fantastic. Examples are simple but not trivial and is perfect for understanding some complex construct. Speed of instruction is just right. Highly recommend.
13353,The course is a great introduction to video game development using Unity Of.Highly recommendable for those who love videogames and want to create their own.
13354,I really love this course!
13355,most of it you can't do unless you pay for it. - not sure I can even click 'complete' for the course. so not really a MOOC. - no option for collaboration.Sides had useful content about 50% of the.Week 4 resources was by far the best and most useful.
13356,"I am very happy about this course. The instructor are world class, top rate."
13357,Great insight in terms of the psychology and neuroscience behind learning and how our brains work.
13358,"Great course for beginning, but I fell like it needs more exercises."
13359,"I have learned exceptionally well from all the materials, lab work and video through out the course."
13360,I love the course! It's a great introduction on how to eat healthy. I've been meaning to know more about nutrition and this is a great first step :)
13361,"Excellent class to learn to visualized data using Tableaux, I feel a lot more confident about using Tableaux and its features. The final exam project was excellent. In a constructive note-- I wish they had a couple more video or Of guides to format a presentation.Well done Instructor"
13362,Short of content and engagement
13363,It is a journey of one's own inner self as experienced throughout the years of compulsory education and later during the life-long studies. One gets to know oneself better and think about improvements s/he can make instantly. I download the pomodoro time to my Sac and realized it's time to fight the hobbies who help in retaining my bad habits of losing time web-browsing or using too much of the precious will power for trying to start learning anything.I will definitely stick to studying the optional material as I have time having finished a project of my life at work. I will miss both Barbara and Terence and their fun way of teaching.
13364,Great Course! Thanks)
13365,"Very nice crash course in HTML, Javascript and CSS"
13366,"His class combined both of my favorite subjects, advanced mathematics, programming, along with my love of data. I learned a lot in this class and I hope I will get a career similar to what this class has taught me."
13367,"A great introduction into fundamental concepts in Python. Or. Chuck is a perfect teacher, funny, competent and engaging. You will watch the video in no time! Also, the electronic version of the book is free and covers every problem you can possibly come across in this course. By recommendation: install Python on your computer immediately after unrolling and track the differences between Python 2 (course version) and Python 3. For example, instead of using ""print x"", you will use ""print(x)""."
13368,love the professor!
13369,The last assignment Is not specific enough for me.
13370,World class teacher. Line contents with a very useful legal approach that is often missed in introductory negotiation courses.Compared to other Coursera MOOCs I missed support materials or further reading. Additional assignment and cases could be included.
13371,Great Course
13372,It's a little bit hard for the fresh guns
13373,I thoroughly enjoyed this course and learned a tremendous amount!
13374,"Good material, insightful thoughts about starting a business. However, course material could be better quality. Looking forward to the following courses."
13375,"Thank you for providing this course. It was really very helpful to get an overview of saber-security.But I will also like to suggest you to add some supporting study material along with this course, To it will be helpful to the students who are searching for in-depth knowledge.Thanks again."
13376,Great!
13377,Wonderful course I haven't realized the power of influence before taken this course! Thank You Coursera!
13378,Rhiannon Clinton is a teacher I sense as not very good at the beginning of the course. To my surprise she acquired such self confidence in the end that I can say I am very glad I was part of her course. I would like to have another chance to be on her courses in the future. Congrats!! I know you are on the right path for teaching
13379,"His is an excellent course of the beginners who want to know about machine learning.I hope there will be more deeper course related for those want to advance.By the way, there are some spelling mistakes in the subtitles."
13380,Its easy and fun. Good for those starting to programme.
13381,Very useful.
13382,Love this course.
13383,great course
13384,"very amusing and useful, with movable and passionate professors!"
13385,Very good course with interesting cases and different theories. And also a very good opportunity to think and learn the way of thinking.
13386,Great into class to healthcare information
13387,A remarkable introduction to key approaches to Machine Learning. I'm excited for the coming courses!
13388,great class
13389,"coolest stuff ever, please do more of them so I can tell people to join the course"
13390,this course it's exactly what I needed. The teacher has a Great Talent to simplify otherwise difficult topics and you can see she knows what she's talking about and gives you perfectly coherent arguments to justify her interpretation of the Ancient Greeks' philosophy.
13391,"His is the worst course I've ever listened, and I've listened my fair share of online courses! To this course ONLY if you want to complete whole specialization!Professor is simply awful, English is not her native language obviously, but even that is not the problem, she simply speaks sentences that doesn't make sense at all! And she obviously doesn't have computer science background, if she does then she is even worse then I thought."
13392,"It's really nice and fun,"
13393,"Good course. Introduces the basis well with a good emphasis on the underlying path. Bayesian technique are missing. Also another suggestion : assignment submission in other languages , especially R - the industry language for prototyping of algorithms."
13394,Not clear examples in the video. Rests are way different than what the Prof. covers in the video.
13395,Too much theoretical.His course should not be a separate course.It can be a part of other course.
13396,I have benefited from this course a lot and truly recommend everyone to pursue.
13397,Good and short video lectures that gets straight to the point
13398,It's really a great introduction to know the very basic things of Data Science. His course will be useful in setting-up the required tools of R programming on your computer. For the beginners this is a must.
13399,Its a superb course to learn machine learning from basis
13400,"Excellent introduction. Made easy to follow with fantastic supporting materials (thanks, Or Chuck!) but dense - I might have to visit this material but for now will forge ahead! Great gratitude for an excellent series of Python courses - just the right length so they can be completed in good time, while building confidence."
13401,"Would be good to introduce more about Scala native solutions like Sutures, parallel data structures and best ways of using them on practice, cases and best practices how to work with shared data, avoid deadlock, how to work best when you have to process large data or when you have massive calculations."
13402,Interactive and full of necessary information. I love this new way to learn
13403,Very interesting course that all interested in financial markets must see
13404,Course helped to reinforce my knowledge and give support to others in other countries.
13405,"Very interesting course.The course material is very good, and Andrew G is very clear and interesting.It's the best course I have been following through the Coursera platform."
13406,Overall great course. Some knowledge Done Illustrator and file forgetting needed.The Studio is out of sink from the video on many lessons.
13407,"Great job! Thanks for sharing your ideas and experiences. For me, it would be more helpful if the teachers or senators, will give their own feedback in week 4's assignment- Prototyping. Their feedback is very much needed as it is their expertise. Thanks!"
13408,"Vice high level overview of the motion of roots. I would have liked to do more programming (modeling of roots, controller, etc.) in the course and have the lectures tie in closer with the content of the quires. The was were very active in the forms and helped clarify/fix any problems that came up."
13409,Was great course.
13410,"Didn't learn much of anything at all, the peer review system is lazy on the Teacher's part, and half of my classmates couldn't even speak proper English, let alone write it."
13411,Outstanding course material prepared by a great instructor. I am looking forward to complete the entire series. 5-stars!
13412,Interesting course and specialization. A few inaccuracies need to be corrected so it can be properly pursued at its best.
13413,Very useful
13414,A great course that covers nice topics.
13415,"I wouldn't recommend this course to my worst enemy. There is 0 commitment from the of and enter staff. After 4 weeks of course, not a single reply from any of them in the forms.To make matters worse, the material is very superficial and lacking, the biggest proof of that is that each module is composed of about 4 video of 5 minutes each! Now can you learn anything in 5 minutes? The topics are so complex, there is simply no way to convey their message in just about 5 minutes. I had to search a lot outside of this course to grasp something of the topics covered. Actually, I found way better explained video on couture for free.The assignment of this course are poorly developed and don't reflect what is discussed in the video well. I repeat myself, the study material was very lacking and consequently not enough for the assignment themselves. I had to spend days coming, debugging and reverse engineering the assignment files to finally be able to pass because they were wrong! They were incomplete and had wrong information. His is not a reverse engineering course... I shouldn't need to do that. Anyway, I did it because there was also no help from any of to guide me in the right direction.Long story short, you are way better off checking the syllabus of this course and checking video on couture to learn about them, you'll learn way more than with this money grabbed course."
13416,Great Course to put everything together
13417,A lot of hard work but this was exactly what I was looking for. A science-based approach with practical application to my reaching.
13418,"Personally for me who had read about neurology, psychology and human behavior. His course does not build a lot on my formal knowledge. However it would be useful to anyone who is interested in learning and curious about brain facts and psychology of learning."
13419,this is amazing!
13420,Pretty easy
13421,"Brilliant, really liked this course. Really interesting, great assignment."
13422,approach more skill for business
13423,"It's really insightful, It would be great if the test cases for each problems, shared with the student.Thank you!"
13424,"Vice course, probably the best so far in this specialization. I really enjoyed Merged Having's lectures - they were simple & clear. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for Entail Veeraraghavan's lectures -he tried to explain an introductory 2-3 months statistics course in just one hour-absolute failure. I definitely recommend the course but I would like to see some improvements in the future sessions with more examples on expel instead of reading mathematical formula from put files."
13425,"I found that the video weren't entirely helpful when tickling the assignment. I had to outsource most, if not all, of my inquiries to external sources (read: stick overflow). Even simple things such as advanced indexing, such as multi-indexing, was unclear. I understand that not everything can be covered, but I feel that basic things should be. Other than that, I enjoyed using the Jupiter notebook, and thought this was integrated very nicely into the coursework."

Thank you to the lecturer and much appreciated.Perhaps a little additional material to give it some depth? I just felt a little more was needed to validity the material to put what we learn into practice. But apart from that, a worthwhile course for anyone that needs to negotiate in their business. I am sure I will refer back to this from time to time, as some printers will help keep you in focus with your strategics."

13443,Excellent review of calculus!!
13444,"Great, fantastic information that made me see the importance of data sciences in materials science and engineering. By only request would be to potentially spend more time flushing out PCA and the statistical tools around it; most of it went over my head without seeing a step-by-step application of it that showed the calculations. Maybe it could be optional so that those who are already strong in PCA can skin it."
13445,"Great introduction into the world of finance, highly recommended & very enjoyable!"
13446,Very good!!! Super helpful
13447,"His was a great course because I like a good challenge; it was way more difficult than I had previously anticipated.

I really appreciated the sides and resources made available (I spent time off course to get a bit further).

13464,"learned a lot so far, even the quires are intelligent"
13465,I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It was not boring due to the fun format Professor Navarro and Flex had created.The course was very general but it was designed so we could have a grasp of the necessary functional financial knowledge to navigable our daily life.I liked the examples given throughout the lessons to aid the concepts.I will definitely take another course teaching by Professor Navarro.

I have no previous medical knowledge or training, so this course may be better suited for someone who is a pre-med student and at least understands some of who"
13479,His course is an excellent one that every professional must take in order to develop negotiation skill. The course is presented in an easy way to understand by foreign students and the Professor is an experienced professional in the matter that helps students to understand all topics using interesting real examples. I suggest all people in Coursera´s community to take advantage of this course.
13480,I truly feel I can learn more confidently with the tips and tools from this course.
13481,"Or. Severance takes students at a nice slow pace through this first course, which for experienced programme like me can seem too slow at times, but it's a good pace with the premise, ""Programming for Everybody,"" in mind. I would have like more programming examples, perhaps as non-grade assignment, in place of the lesser-value bonus interviews and Office Hours segments."
13482,"Really good course, Thank you :That I liked the most is?- The loans at the end of each ""not always"" lesson.The professor gives you the what´s, why´s and some tips."
13483,The course really helps me review important things in English grammar and punctuation.
13484,I really think that this course is the best specialization already available online.

13496,Depth technical introduction to machine learning and its related concepts.
13497,"A very good introduction to major branches of Philosophy. While some questions on assignment were rather vague, and some lectures rather dull (I don't think I gathered watching the video from the third week on... just relied on the- excellency put together!- handouts). Overall, a great course to take for a beginner to the world of Philosophy :D"
13498,His course was great.

13502,Great Tutor!
13503,"His is one of the best courses available on Coursera, it's very professionally presented and covers the topic from an academic point of view.His is not a cook-course that gives you circuits that are ready to implement, instead this course focus more on the design (from scratch) and the trade-off involved.Also the details provided here is very deep in the topic, if you are expecting a nice easy into course this one might not be the good choice.ISA I'm going definitely to continue the specialization and I'm looking forward to the knowledge and concepts I'll learn :)"

13508,Very good teacher and course
13509,"The audit volume throughout the video should be improved; consistently, my ears were bombarded during the first shot(s), but as soon as the side-shot plus code came into view I had to crank up the volume in order to understand what was said.Otherwise, it was a very well thought-out and enjoyable class, thanks!"
13510,Great course!
13511,Very helpful in building a basic understanding of working with database through Python.

13516,Good information but definitely different from that of the law enforcement communities
13517,Solid course with beginner information about swift programming language and some small projects in swift.
13518,A very useful course for beginners who have no knowledge of Unity. His is the best course to learn about the basis in the Unity and using the Interface. Scripting walk through was not enough. A few more exercises would have made it the best course
13519,"Million thanks to share this treasure with us ,very very interestingThank you EFL"
13520,Interesting subject and excellent presentation!
13521,His class provided a new perspective about my workers. Helping me to better understand their behavior. It also helped me evaluate my own strength and weaknesses. A good team building exercise.

13526,Great course. It gives very good basis of what you need to know if you want to make a career in the music business. I loved all the interviews with industry insider - they sort of allow you to see the big picture from different angles. All the recommended reading was also pretty useful.
13527,"I am finding that the material is very relevant to our present era. I see now many news items which relate to the learning available in this course. I like writing about the topics, the activity firms up my understanding of those topics."
13528,Great course !
13529,Wonderful course and instructor. Bonus video are also very helpful.
13530,"Amazing course, i had complete Ruby on Nails tutoring by Michael Part and i was still doubtful about clot of things but i think this course has put me on the right path and now in really confident and i think i will go all the way, John Hopkins university courses are amazing, very good for learning. I highly recommend it to anyone wants to learn Ruby on Nails."
13531,"Amazing, very well presented with a contagious enthusiasm"

13533,His is very useful course! The professor describe all courses with calm and very kindly. I also love that it is an open course with no time limit so that I could enjoy and repeat every time I need. Please continue the next chapters or next Chinese language course for all of us. Thank you.
13534,"Had potential, but exercises and quires do not align with content taught by professor. His is not a beginners course!"
13535,Great...!
13536,very comprehensive course!
13537,The course was a bit mixed in terms of its quality.
13538,Great lesion!
13539,Outstanding course.

13541,one of the best course I did! if everyone at work could do this course it would be a way better place to work!!!
13542,"Very useful. Sides are short, so it's easy to complete it and don't require much time."
13543,"Good course for those with limited exposure to business merits. Would be more valuable to include 5 or 6 standard Key Performance Indicator (KPI's) by function (marketing, sales, operations, finance), etc. that will be typically encountered in an advanced undergraduate or MBA program."
13544,Great insight.
13545,The best course on Scala.
13546,"introduces the fundamentals of Tableaux and gave examples of story board, explored basic functions of Tableaux, a good introduction course to Tableaux."
13547,the course was very interesting and i learned a lot of new ideas. my vision of learning has involved. thank you
13548,Quality course to learn the base of business merits. The key terms are explained in a very interesting way. The quires are clever and challenging.

13550,Very interesting courses
13551,In awesome introduction to astrophysics
13552,"In amazing course of machine learning, having this kind of content for free is just incredible. Thank you Coursera and Andrew G."
13553,Prof. Jogesh rocks!
13554,I enjoyed and learned some new basis crucial to our current most used way of communication! thanks.
13555,"The lectures were great. While some people complained that ""the instructor is reading off something else"" that never seemed to be a problem. Or. Glimmer did a good job of making the lectures friendly and understandable. The best part of the course was the assignment. I loved how I actually had to go to people and interview them, draw storyboards of ideas I have and heuristically evaluate sites. The assignment made sure I was actually engaged in doing them. One thing I would suggest is to try different motif for different sessions. It seems that students always work with a ""transportation problem"" in this course. That can be mixed up from time to time I think to give the students a more diversified experience of Human Entered Design."
13556,May be too wide in terms of issues
13557,The course provides the right platform to folks who are newby to patron and gives meaningful information for development on Raspberry I
13558,Great introduction into the world of Data Science. I appreciated the 3 different lectures who each brought a different aspect of data into light.Thank you all.
13559,His class is a great introduction to the tools needed to begin working on data analysis. The assignment provide just enough instruction to cover the basis and proper you toward covering additional information on your own. The assignment are structures in such a way that you must pay close attention to the lectures; then analyze and apply them on your own. Great course overall.
13560,"A, is super pleasant it was so nice to spend some time in his happiness univers. He spot our bad habits and recommend simple change of midst to get back on track to happiness path."
13561,Very much enjoyed the class. Articulated ideas in a clear manner allowing one to reflect and best approach problems.
13562,Awesome content!
13563,"course content was great, but I felt like the course left me hanging...."
13564,Great Introduction to of Healthca
13565,"Great into to polymorphism, casting classes, sorting and datastructures"
13566,a bit too simple to be a paid course
13567,Very helpful!
13568,"I'm not mother. I'm still a college student but, the course gave me a lot of tools to improve the quality and take care of the cooking at my home. I decided to take this course because of my dad, who has a heart disease. Thank you so much."
13569,Very interesting class. Very useful.
13570,Thank you so much! That was a perfect course!
13571,"Logic can be fun, but this class pretty much kills that spirit by burying it under pretty horrendous and tedious formalization. In into to logic should be considerably simpler, and with more interesting content and exercises."
13572,"His course means well but the lectures in the first half of the course are not good. The instructor seems to take a midway between vigorous mathematics, using terms like robust etc while at the same time also trying to keep it easily accessible. of Men's courses take a much better approach in that they keep things at one end of the spectrum (simple language). Having a background in theoretical physics and computer science, this quality in this course is very confusing for me. Also, I do not need to see a tiny, grain video onset of the instructor during the lecture video."
13573,I love learning and I love photography. It is great that this is o
13574,good class
13575,Love the course.
13576,"WOOO .. His course is great ,, with the quit in between the video lectures makes learning fun.the home work problems are also great to work. More emphasis laid on the situations results to be read correctly and reflecting those results onto the solution for the home work problems...still looking forward more to learn and simulate....."
13577,To translations available despite what subtitles and transcripts say.
13578,One of the best mood's ever!
13579,right course for beginners
13580,"Is a health professional who works mostly (basically ONLY) with pregnant women, I found this course very interesting and at the same time I gained so much knowledge from it. I recommend this course to anyone looking to expand their knowledge of this process in a woman's life."
13581,"A very complete and engaging course.I completely recommended it to anyone in the music business. There are facts that I lived throughout the music evolution that I had forgotten. But taking this course not only reminded me a lot, but took me deeply into the many details I missed. Plus, this course showed me a lot of what I lacked in the past business ventures.His course also guided my previous acquired knowledge. Because of the chronograph order and the way professor Dark exposed the facts, I was able to reorganized my knowledge and experience and re-save it in a much useful order in my brain.I feel much more professional and ready to re-take my business and return to the music industry.Thank you so much Coursera, West Virginia University, professor Dark Velichkovski and all professional involved in the making of this amazing peace of art.I sincerely recommend it.Andrew SoulsilenS"
13582,In excellent course one must take who is interested in the issues of the present world and the solutions for these issues. Professor Geoffrey sacks has done a great job. Thumbs up.

13589,His course expects you to have a lot more ground for an intermediate course.
13590,"great overview, and very enjoyable/interesting."
13591,Great course. I recommend for everyone.
13592,Good introductory course that covered a lot of concepts
13593,"One of the best, most fun introductory Python course on Coursera. You'll create games!!! You create then you play to entertain yourselves and your fellow friends! That else do you need??? It's super fun!"
13594,"Very powerful and explicit especially very for persons who understood that to make this world a better place requires better and an excellent grasp of knowledge. Learning Now to Learn gives you that mental capacity to learn more effectively since you cannot think on what you don't know.Thanks, I'm truly enjoying myself."
13595,Awesome course with very interesting practical exercises.
13596,"Great course. Moved the energy of the instructor, the general flow, tutorials and the best part was the Open Etats textbook. Deep it up."
13597,It's great! The assignment help me understand the course better! I really appreciate that.
13598,"I was expecting to solve problems using more open-source package. Unfortunately, I feel this series of courses are more of an advertisement for the instructor's software company."
13599,"His course is really AMAZING, I had a lot of fun learning how to learn, and it broaden my vision of learning - and helped me a lot of course."
13600,"It is not perfect, but as an open course it is impressive."
13601,Good overview of the rock industry and good survey of music.
13602,"Really awesome course! Especially the peer review assignment. They give an overall view of what are the problems being faced by everyone around the world! The course structure is really good and is optical for learning. After the course, one really has a changed perspective towards the earth and you would be inspired with purpose! A purpose to work for the betterment of mankind!"
13603,"Good material, but even better external material shown by links to blows or related stuff.Too focused in SCRUM. Maybe other methodologies are worth to explain.I'll not buy it since I'm a of, but if you are beginning with this topics or want to pursue a of certificate, this course definitely can help you."
13604,"Last and very effective course, though it could be a bit deeper."
13605,Totally disappointed!
13606,I am honoured to have been able to learn from Professor Robert Miller.
13607,"Simple and easy tips and a very short course. Thanks to the teacher, the university and Coursera for this course.:)"
13608,A very good course indeed.
13609,"The course is logical and thorough, fearlessly delivered (well, except maybe the audit quality at times), and challenging just enough to make a seasoned imperative programme scream in frustration, but not quit. 😀 The only thing standing between this course and perfection are the pop quit bags. But even they contribute to the message of the course in a way: if Coursera's platform were written in Scala, there probably would be fewer of them. 🕷"
13610,Amazing course
13611,"His is the best course so far! Teacher is amazing! You have to spend some time on this course, but ""at the end of the day"" it is worth it."

13617,i love this course
13618,"I love the way that the course is explained and designed. The questions during the video helped me to understand every concept. Now, I feel better programming using HTML and JAVASCRIPT."
13619,It is a good course. I took it after Functional Programming Principles in Scala. I learned new things....But..... The reason i rate 3 is that:1) Programming Assignment doesn't really correspond to the Lecture material.2) The Lecture material becomes very complicated in some Lectures because of Back of Explanation (e.g: Dec 4.3. There are still many disambiguations of how the Prof. creates some models (again lack of explanation)3) Too many unanswered critical questions remain in the forum!!!Anyway it's worth your time.
13620,"His course armed the amateur manager I was, with the solid foundation that the professional project manager I am becoming really needed in order to start thriving in his career."
13621,"The class is well organized and Prof Andrew covers many of topics that are very practical and easily to learn, even for people without any of experience. I'm pretty sure if we follow the class and finish all the assignment the students should have a very comprehensive view of what of does and how it can solve the real problem. For more advanced technologies and mathematics proofs, this class does not explore much. However it cannot stop me liking this class!"
13622,Learning how to learn taught me a lot of tools to learn. I enjoyed a lot all the material. I will try to take all of this new knowledge in my life.
13623,Great class with good support examples!

13634,"A very useful practical course, thanks a lot!"
13635,Course with interesting perspective and practical tips.
13636,"Amazing course, I did learn a lot."
13637,A good starting point to ancient philosophy .

13639,His course is the best option to know or review all the graphics design essentials and how to combine them to make a good piece of communication art.

13642,Clear presentation of basic data structures with non-trivial applications. Material is presented very well for beginning coming or as a review. Online trading is better than many programming courses. Works well as a stand alone course.
13643,"Even if you know a lot about this period of history, this course is useful. The thoughtful and thorough context, the quality of the material and teaching, were excellent."
13644,"Great course. my constructive criticism has to do with the organizing of the group activities, it's just very difficult to organize into groups via people whom you have not met, especially given the time zone differences as well the differences in daily schedules for group members. I just wonder if there's a possibility to organize the group projects in such a way that the webster allows for better asynchronous work (not just smiling back and forth as that feels very disorganized)? Otherwise I feel that I learned a lot and I feel that this is a great into class."
13645,A well structures and practical work tormented project.
13646,very useful
13647,Great course!
13648,Professor Worthington was awesome and I learned so much. Thank you so much.
13649,His is an excellent course!
13650,Excellent!! Or Chuck awesome!!! (thank you very much)
13651,"I did not have a lot of experience in machine learning, so this course was very good in the aspect of introducing people to machine learning concepts. Most of the times the material was very well explained, and I like the concept of the tutor writing on the screen at the same time they are presenting, personally it helps me more. Some of the quires were easy so you did not need a lot of preparation, some of them were more difficult or troublesome, like the quit for Deep Learning. I also liked the graphlab module, I think that learning how to use it will help me with my own work.However, as this course does not really go in depth in the algorithms themselves, I feel that after one month and a half I have a basic idea, but I haven't learned much about how to implement machine learning on my own even in basic things, while other courses have more or less the same time frame and are more dense in their material. In my opinion, this whole introductory course would just be just splitter and each of these intrductory weeks would be happened as the first week of the subsequent nodules to come. Because anyway, after 4 months in the specialization, if somebody continues to the recommended systems module for example, he/she would have forgotten the basis of this so they would need to cover again the recommended systems week in this course. And from the other hand, if some introduction is again repeated in the subsequent nodules, then why have this introductory course anyway?Thanks."
13652,I really love all courses from MOMA... they are very professional
13653,Very Good!
13654,Andrew G is the best!
13655,His is great a course. Thank you to all the good course teachers
13656,Amazing course introducing real and portable concepts. I will be applying this to my workflow immediately.Only downfall being a little ambiguity in some questions and some `multiple choice` questions only allow one answer (radio buttons).Thank you!
13657,"Some topics that are important, are obviate"
13658,Excellent Course. It helped me point out my weaknesses in learning methods. Oats off to Barbara Valley. Cheers
13659,Good learning for Data integration and ETL learning. Now data from source to target table transform over the business requirement to be ready for processing
13660,"His course is amazing, more than I expected, you can relate it with everything, no matter your career, it´s effective"
13661,I would love the course much more if there are more examples
13662,Learnt a lot ... Really interesting and information
13663,of WAS A WONDERFUL COURSE. THANKS of CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY AND THE PROFESSOR of. LARRY LAGERSTROM FOR DELIVERING THE COURSE of A VERY SYSTEMATIC AND JOYFUL MANNER.
13664,Quite happy one
13665,His course is helpful for me.
13666,The course is absolutely great!
13667,Need more exercises
13668,I have learned a lot from this course!
13669,"I loved this course. I can't tell you how many people I've told to take it. In addition to helping myself learn new/old topics, I am looking forward to using my new knowledge in order to help my children succeed in school. thank you for such a wonderful course."
13670,Very educational and relevant to modern day organizations.
13671,It could ask more of the student. The assignment was read and do.
13672,"Very useful to improve business skill, well structures and practical."
13673,very simplifies and very useful!
13674,"His course makes a valiant effort to provide as much coverage of Bayesian statistical methods as the prior three courses in the ""Statistics in R"" specialization do for Frequentist statistical methods, but the lack of supporting material (e.g. reading/text exercises directly haired with each lesson) really hamper this. The video are quite information, but if you don't catch on to the material based strictly on the video, the weekly quires can be a bit frustration."
13675,Good quality content and great instructor. I recommend it!It does not cover though a very important feature from angular: directive.
13676,Excellent and very useful course! I recommend!
13677,"Take yourself a favor, just take the course. I have done a lot of the opposite of what I should have done. Barbara Valley is so nice to explain to you, every video is easy to muster and follow. The course is not solely study technique in the conventional form, the most valuable parts are how our brain solved problems and the basic chemistry that affects it. I enjoyed, I have not finished watching the optional video but I will and even bought the book. Definitely will review it often or as Or Barbara said ""try to recall"" big parts of it and learn it deeply."
13678,Good course to understand the basis.
13679,Course only gives an overview.
13680,"His is a course that would be helpful to complete programming novices. Any prior knowledge of programming is likely to render it useless to the student. That being said, a programming newby should have no problem following it.The professor speaks slower than necessary. 1.six or x speed make the pace more manageable and is still easy to follow.In addition, it uses an old version of Python, which tends to make the exercises slightly annoying."
13681,I am thinking that the teacher can be a little bit dynamic and energetic.
13682,A course with a wonderful mix of theory and practical examples which gave me a sound understanding of the field of machine learning.
13683,Moved the problem in the course.
13684,Great course to understand the basic concepts of tireless communication.
13685,It's a great course!
13686,"Totally in love with the course, assignment and material is really professional, recommend it 100%"
13687,other than the quit.. everything else was good.. quit was not challenging enough..
13688,"Should have a bigger practical component. Also, there are a lot of technical problems with the course."
13689,A very interesting and useful class! : )
13690,Wonderful Content and well explained
13691,Good course for summarize
13692,"Great course! I learned a lot about innovation, creativity, idea management, portfolio management and how to execute innovation projects."
13693,"Good into, lots to think about"
13694,"Simple, Smooth and Age.In example of it own purpose."
13695,Very useful - even brought me to further research subjects covered.
13696,"great course! It is really help me a lot during my learning progress and I think the technique will help me much more in the future. I have introduced the course to my friends, they like the course too!"
13697,Is an amazing course for learn about how is the best way for nourish kiss. I love it.
13698,"The course was entertaining, didactic and emotional. His was my first experience in Corsera and I am thankful to Professor John Reason for his didactic quality and for his humanity in dealing with such sensitive and dramatic subjects."
13699,Very good design and teaching for a intermediate level learning course! Easy to learn with practice with Jupiter notebook.
13700,"Is an introduction before starting Finance nodules is perfect. History of finance, main concepts, useful into, short but information. More related to of economy, but Prof.Achilles's examples helps a lot. Of you want to understand better of learn more, need to download whole lectures from Pale for this course(23 of them available online). Good luck to everyone!!!"
13701,It's valuable course in terms of realizing what's needed to make or maintain your personal brand.
13702,I loved this course! I already had two characters that I had created. His course forced me to actually think about how I am going to implement my characters into their world.
13703,Wonderful resource for parents and teachers and families!
13704,"I loved being able to hear directly from the leaders of the civil rights movement. The course video were short enough that I got through the course in two Saturday afternoon. The stories interwoven historical events and insight, practical strategics for mobilizing, and inspiring/moving confession of light in even the darkness times.Some of my favorite parts included learning about the following:-Nails were used as active classroom for university students! They even shared into on college access with a jail ward. Crazy.-The civil rights leaders honored all people's dignity and believed in their mission beyond what seemed to be in front of their eyes. Who would have thought that the jailed students would sing to jail staff by name, that they'd build a relationship with them, that they'd sing songs of such conviction to uplifts their spirits and to warn the system to ""be prepared"" for the many more who'd soon join their movement.-Andrew Young's confession about what his wife told him after they read about Or. Lafayette, essentially ""drop everything, we gutta go back home NOW."" Their sacrifice and courage, even when they had everything set up for them in the North, are incredible to witness.-The cross-continental influences! I didn't know Him Dawson was a divinity school student, who ended up learning non-violence in India where he lived 3 years as a missionary. The intervention of faith, social justice, calling, cross-cultural sharing/empowering were themes I found unable to shake from my mind days after I finished this course.-The civil rights movement was fiercely organized and executed. It didn't happen accidently over night, or by fury or whim of young folks alone. Even the young - so many of the leaders were so young!!! - had a very clear strategy to winning against structural racism, and even their sacrifices ""dares"" so to speak were planned and not foolish. They knew what dangers or threats there may be, but it was always with a clear goal and purpose that they put themselves in the act of civil disobedience.I will be spending my coming months going through the reading, books, and independent research to learn more about the civil rights movements and its leaders. I was not taught any of this in detail in highschool, which I feel that it should!!! His course is timely, and much needed, as it's been disparaging to try to remain engaged and active under Trumplandia. Thank you to those who lived this history. Thank you of MUCH for translating your experiences into another digestive course, so that less informed folks like me can encounter (albeit late) your bravery, intelligence, and accomplishments which should never be forgotten."
13705,Pretty good course for beginners.
13706,Amazing course
13707,Very useful course to get the foundation in understanding the smiling process
13708,i am a much happier person.His class helped me tremendouslyto see the glass half full(maybe even more than half full)rather than half empty.Thank you Or. Happy Smartsand the Happiness Team
13709,Enjoyed the course Kimberley. You made it fun and information and I used the content to make a slew of changes! I had a real distilling of exactly where I am going with my brand and I'm off on this adventure of creating it now. An I convince you to do a course ORM through Coursera?
13710,Great course! I hope the team release the following module. The material provided is really good and the lectures are dynamic and well edited. The short answer assignment could be peer reviewed!
13711,this is very nice course.He can learn a lot from this course.
13712,"Exceptional course! His is challenging material for me, but it's presented in such a coherent manner that you can't help but absorb it."
13713,A good introduction to machine learning.
13714,"good teacher, excellent class.Suis Fernando Restrepo"
13715,Good course for learn Deep Learning.
13716,Easy to understand
13717,Very funny and interesting.Also pretty practical
13718,Great introduction on fundamentals of Project Fanning and Management
13719,"Amazing course! Great professors, lectures and material. Essential course for those interested in international tax law."
13720,it was great and i learned a lot!
13721,"You are not actually writing any code for this particular course. The assignment are just taking screenshots of running code that is already provided to you in the code depositors for this course. The lectures are great, there is a lot to learn from them but the assignment are a total bust. Not worth it for the money, but go for it if you want to complete the entire specialization"
13722,its really industry related programme and very useful .
13723,"Good one, more examples about real life situations would be valuable"
13724,I found the social computing session was interesting
13725,His is really a very good and perfect base for web developer who start their career..!!
13726,"Too much material, that moved too fast. Wasn't opportunity for enough feedback and explanation. I say this as someone who went to Duke and has taken similar classes at Duke!"
13727,Very good course :)
13728,A smart course! I love it!
13729,"I found the course very useful to review some basic economic policy concepts and to improve the understanding of major economic and policy making issues that challenge both policy makers and advisers today.Prof. Table Millard has a real gift to explain in a clear and appealing way complex ideas and policy issues.The only objection I would have regards the peer assignment trading which I found somehow lacking in realism and accuracy. I also found that, on the discussion forms, some of the senators replies did not completely met expectations. Having said that, I would not hesitate in recommending this outstanding course to both beginners and more advanced students and generally to anybody interested in improving his(her) knowledge of economics. Congratulations!"
13730,"Exceptionally well arranged, taught, and organized course. I had a lot of fun learning, ever more fun solving quires and programming assignment. Prof Andrew G is a truly master in the craft of machine learning and an exceptionally gifted teacher, which is a rear combination and I as a participant of the course feel privileged to have been learning this fascinating area of science from him. Is a follow-up to the course I wish I could make a real world machine learning application for a particular vertical, under guiding supervision of Prof Andrew G's team."
13731,A lot of g
13732,Over very broad range of topic
13733,The teaching was awesome. I had already taken course in Mobile Computing during my Under graduate study. I suggest you develop a course with in depth concepts covering more technical details.
13734,"The whole co-system is based on Graphlab create which is not very commonly used in the industry. The ""Programming assignment"" are very much like the exercise done in the video - so no real thought and effort were needed. The Deep learning part is really bad thought and bad examined."
13735,"Very helpful and covered a wide range of topics, this course has definitely helped me widen my knowledge on animal behaviour and welfare and will assist me with my future career."
13736,"Carry R Lagerstrom is an extraordinary instructor, for an extraordinary course."
13737,Excellent and easy to follow
13738,The course is very difficult to comprehend..Moreover the explanations given ar not concise and brief..
13739,"Seriously, this has been the best course of my life. You learn the principles of Machine learning. You also learn the underlying path and concepts that support this theory (this is optional and you don't need a strong mathematical background to take this course)"
13740,Very interesting and useful.
13741,Clearly and easy to apply this to my work and life time.
13742,Very well organized. Amazing!
13743,Thanks
13744,"I am really unhappy with this course. Coming to R with some background in statistics and SQL, but lacking programming experience, I assumed this would be an introduction. The material in the lectures is straightforward enough, and the will exercises are easy to get through and information, but the assignment are, without exception, based on writing functions in R with basically zero experience. Having no background or frame of reference for best practices in santa, logic, etc, and very little information in the lectures or supplementary material to help, I found these to be almost impossible to complete.Furthermore, there's no mechanism or provision in the course to review the assignment after they're submitted. To not only did I not feel like I was doing the work correctly, I can't get feedback, and the lecturer doesn't break down the rational behind the assignment, and how he would have done it or why. In addition, the assignment bear only a tangential relationship to the lecture material. To I would be feeling good coming out of a lecture and going through will exercises, only to be plunged into a programming assignment that was far too advanced for the small steps I felt I had taken in my overall competence with the language and material.I don't doubt that someone with better knowledge of programming can get through this stuff, but this class should be reserved for advanced earners only, or maybe be broken up into two courses. I feel like I wasted $49."
13745,His course made me realize a lot of flaws in my current technique of study. Hence I have been able to rectify those shortcomings to become a better learner.
13746,Excellent and insightful course!
13747,Matthew is a great instructor. Moved the way how he taught the entire series especially this one. Step by Step explaining every little detail. Deep up the good work...
13748,Good for me
13749,Interesting and insightful for those who are looking to find their position in the history of the whole universe.
13750,thanks
13751,His course is really useful and the tutor always gives wonderful solution for my problem. Sincerely recommend anyone who want to learn patron take this course.
13752,"His course is absolute garage. You get no feedback on your quires or assignment and the professor is one of the most boring I've ever seen. It's absurdly frustration to repeatedly fail without any feedback as to why you're failing.The lectures are clearly from a path perspective, as the prof simply draws what he's talking about on the sides. His hand writing is poor, and he does a lackluster job of explaining what exactly he's doing.Finally, pure lecture with no notes is almost impossible to learn, as there's nothing to read and study.I'd rate this course a 1/10, take the course on tunes from Caltech instead."
13753,Great Course! 5 Stars!
13754,Actually I have enjoyed the course . I have learned about the problems were asked by previous philosophers and about how to think correctly by analyzing the preface to get logical results .
13755,It is too basic
13756,Very helpful in my everyday life. :)
13757,"Short course, with very insightful ideas, well presented and with a very practical approach."
13758,Very light and practical course. Good for beginners but also nice to refresh some tips for intermediate users.
13759,"Very recommended course! A good teacher and good and useful topics, examples and hands on exercises. I learned a lot from this course."
13760,"His teacher is amazing. He makes this looks easy, and in fact he does explain it in a very simple way. West teacher in this field. Thanks for your patience, and for everything."
13761,"Well paced, easy to follow, and very enlightening."
13762,A truly excellent course
13763,"The course covered the mains issues of a very complex topic in a very compact way, I have definitely extended my skill and knowledge! Thanks to the lectures!"
13764,"Well taught, fun to watch the video and I definitely got positive input to improve my learning skill! 10/10"
13765,Structures course content. Thanks clot Coursera !!
13766,"Very challenging, but totally rewarding and worth the effort!"
13767,"His class is more of a Marketing 101 class than a digital marketing class. Interesting, and probably a great class for someone looking for the basis of marketing."
13768,"I absolutely loved this course. Is an employee on the digital side of one of the world's leading beauty bands, I found this course extremely relevant to the real-world marketing & strategic issues I face on a day-to-day basis."
13769,"Hands down, one of the best courses I've ever taken. Exciting, information and motivation teaching style!"
13770,Was been an awesome experience!
13771,"The course is a good starting point for students who are interested in Private Equity. The content is vigorous and explore all the basic principles in different fields (tax, legal and financial issues). Therefore, I highly recommend this course. Any thanks professor Stefano Caselli, it was a good experience."
13772,His is a great course to start learning R. The material is clear and the the topics are well structures
13773,The course is very good in my opinion. There are some little drawback though. The assignment are not very difficult but expect you to be autonomous in setting up the environment; this was a bit of a hardly for some students. Also the reviews could be better. The review feedback depends on how well the reviewed understood the subject; more concrete instructions would be good as well as more precise criterion for the trading of the peer review.
13774,"it gives good impute. However, it looks to me that it is directed more to science, path, engineering students than students of social sciences."
13775,"Very Good course.Very Good course.In my view some needed additions to be excellent. Summarise of the important issues in each lecture video can be introduced might be in a form of Power Joint Presentation. His will highlight the main topics. His can be done for each video, each lesson and each module.Prof. Or. John Mud have already made these summarise and conclusions during his video lectures, but it is not easy to retrieve when you are searching about some specific subject. You have to here again a group of video to find what you need."
13776,In awesome course for beginners..Starts from the root of logic building and programming and moves forward to some tough problems..Very interactive sessions with an awesome teacher who brings a big smile on your face whenever you open the video..Feeling really high after completing the course... Thank you..:)
13777,"In excellent overview of machine learning technique, supplemented by programming exercises in Active or Atlas to reinforce the concepts introduced in the lectures."
13778,"His is a great course, one of the better ones in the series."
13779,Life-changing. I loved this course!
13780,Strongly recommended
13781,Progressive exercises and efficient support. It is possible to do the mortification more quickly using only the book. But the video and interactivity of Coursera add interesting elements. A very adaptable and efficient way to learn the basis of Python.
13782,Project submission to video changed compared to other classes
13783,"this course is very useful and helpful, it let you to set your own goal of physical activity and tells you how to keep going."
13784,"I spent a year coming, working on other programming languages and came back to this one a second time. I had the same exact learning issues as before. Luckily I had a better background but still had trouble going from lecture to exam. Will() is great."
13785,"In general, this is a good course. It provides many handy tools. But I still wish it had provided a larger scope of other tools we could learn in the future, even if the course doesn't teach these. In essence, I learned much, but my horizon wasn't broadened much."
13786,"While I appreciate the logic behind this class, the content seemed very subjective and loose compared of the class prior."
13787,Very good course.
13788,"nice MOOC , i like it , it was more and more interesting , keep going"
13789,Homework are more complicated compared to the class examples.
13790,"Excellent course! His course was very well designed and executed and covered the content at a really good pace. Andrew's lectures were very clear and well presented, the materials and assignment were great quality, and I found his style engaging. He is clearly passionate about the topic he is teaching. Overall very highly rate."
13791,It is an amazing course that reaches all the digital concepts in a very easy way.
13792,"It's ok; worth your time if you are trying to get into philosophy and want part of the proper foundation. Overall I enjoyed it and it was good as a hand-hold through the pre-Socratics and some of the most essential Platonic writings.Gros: the video are pretty easy to understand, and the material chosen/covered is good to know.Sons: the video quit questions are really...dull...and there are too many. A downside of the ease of the video/lectures is that they don't really go that in depth, and they're nowhere near the quality I've seen in other Coursera courses (like the Kierkegaard course from copenhagen)."
13793,pretty good course
13794,Probably the best computer science related MOOC in the internet!
13795,"The best classes I have ever had. I enjoyed every single lessons in the class, the assignment and trading other students assignment were fun. The last assignment is quite challenging, but it is worth learning. It the end of the class, I feel like I am a real developer, and ready for real world challenges. I highly recommend anyone to take this class."
13796,"I learned a lot from this course. The only thing i observed this course was lacking is that the video lectures and the homework assignment given were not perfectly in son with each other, as the lectures did not completely cover the things we were supposed to do in assignment."
13797,Right be an instructive course but the guy who presents it is really creep. And knowing he was involved in the official 9/11 report makes him hard to believe on any issue.
13798,very interesting course
13799,Well Structures and presented
13800,Brilliant! A must for anyone responsible for children's nourishment.
13801,"Easy to comprehend, full of examples, a lot of challenges, excellent teachers, and everything! I love this course's programming assignment as those assignment show me directly the ""real"" application of each week's topic.The most extremely valuable thing that I got from this course is that I now can read documentation properly. I thought that reading documentation is tedious, but now I know that it is very fundamental."
13802,Great teacher and an excellent into to front end development.
13803,"Or Chuck's introduction to programming where he is explaining variable, constant and later functions, arguments etc. is really good and I would say universal for any programming language. To definitely excellent course for anyone."
13804,Excellent introduction to Machine Learning!
13805,Course is very information and practical
13806,"Absolutely a MUST for anyone looking for a smooth into into APIs, HTTP requests, and data exchange on the web. Is always, Or. Charles' magnificent pedagogy will guide you step by step up to the point where you will be sending requests and fetching data from your Twitter account. Create one if to do not have it yet. :-)It will be absolutely beneficial to update this course to discuss the Twitter library available in Python, wish is far easier to use than the currently explained method."
13807,It was a great course I have ever taken.
13808,"Great course, I really enjoyed it! Even though I've done a bit of front-end web development before, the class gave me a solid foundation in the core concepts and I learned a lot. I would highly recommend it to others."
13809,"It's a great course. Thank you very much professor Yakov, I learnt a lot!"
13810,"Overall, the course is great except for some minor inconvenience of the lecture. Some concepts are not carefully explain like incidence etc"
13811,I love this course! It is very inspiring and full of great ideas!
13812,Excellent base. Very well presented.
13813,"His is a really good course for... well, basically for everyone. It helped me to bust my learning (I'm a musician keen on learning languages). The instructor is very knowledgeable, and there is a lot of good humor and powerful metaphor in the course."
13814,"Good instructor, well explanation and can apply for real world."
13815,It is may which coming to Doctor way.
13816,outstanding prof
13817,Excellent insight into the language and dynamic of strategy formulation.
13818,"Had a really great learning experience, this course is a very good point to start for people who have no experience in programming, almost every concept is explained in detail from scratch."
13819,Great detailed course. Bones of information. Rests were tricky.
13820,"His course is a mess. To not even dare to take it without first doing Machine Learning by Andrew G (excellent started) and before reading ""Deep Learning"" by Goodfellow, Angio, Courville. The presentations are awfully boring, there is little interaction of the material (unlike G who is deriving the path on screen). Into is basically just reading off the crowded sides. Very poor didactic style. I would even go so far as to say that the approach is scientific: no definitions, deviations, examples. Terms just pop out of the blue.Of you already know the topic well, you might gain additional insight from a unit. Suites are nice puzzled that need some thinking and path knowledge. Programming tasks are not even in the same ballpark as G's. Overall very bad use of the medium available.Invest your time in reading ""Deep Learning"", its challenging but at least its got a very logical structure and style. Also consider Hugo Larochelle's video."
13821,I really enjoyed the course and believe the information was really beneficial. They gave great examples of studies that included the technique that were being reviewed.
13822,Excellent foundation course; from understanding data in business to the fundamentals of the role functions that support these merits. A+++++
13823,"I like this class very much, the teacher is very interesting, the video is also very lively,"
13824,His course was very educational. May was great at explaining healthy foods and ingredient that her own family uses at home. I was incorporating her suggestions while taking this course. I'm working to include less processes foods and more fresh fruits and veggies in my families diet. I even started to make fruit/ve smoothed for my 8 year old daughter instead of buying her the 100 % juice I bought in the store as a way to provide her with more vegetables in her diet as well as less processes food. Great course! I will be looking for more courses to take that include May and her wonderful children.
13825,His is such a remarkable course and is indispensable for every aspirin graphics artist as well as enthusiast. It covers the remarkable tends in graphics design from past and how those tends permeated into contemporary practices in design. Thanks a lot to California Institute of the Arts and Coursera for developing and offering such a wonderful course with a blend of design philosophies and insight into hands on practice.
13826,4.5 because it was very difficult to access the optional assignment and there was effort expended on reformatting them since the last offering of the course. Otherwise it's an excellent course and I've already been recommending it.
13827,"His course let me the direction of future education and I, as a student in normal university will devote myself to this career."
13828,"His is a very interesting and intriguing class. The teacher is the most humorous and gentle teacher I've ever met. His classes in this course are diversified. You can never get bored. On't need to worry about this course, the knowledge is fundamental."
13829,Beautiful learning tools

13831,Fantastic!!! A few minor bags with compattibillity but besides this annoying problem very happy so far!! 고맙습니다 선생님이는
13832,"Totally awesome! Great content, great teacher, all video are very well organized and well-thought. There is no need to have any prevail knowledge in genetic nor psychology, it is meant for anyone who wants to look at the world and people differently!"
13833,so great!
13834,Great way to showcase your newly learned skill. Extreme variety of projects reviewing other people's work. Very rewarding!
13835,Besides Songwriting from Berklee this was the most practical and useful course I have taken so far. It answered so many questions I had and gave so valuable tips for the modern musician. Thanks a lot!
13836,Good for the beginners to programming
13837,"Moved it, and the recipe at the end are great!"
13838,His is a very interesting and complete course about solid waste management.
13839,Good course. Occasionally frustration trying to learn to do the assignment without all of necessary support but if you are dedicated you will get through and learn the material too. Course overall is a very manageable pace even if you have no experience like me.
13840,very good reading material
13841,Course goes through basis of Upstream Midstream and Downstream oil and gas industries also its Markets.
13842,"His is a brilliant course by an amazing professor. One of my favourite courses ever.I took this course twice. And it made a huge impact on my life, without exaggeration. Since then I went a couple of times to silence retreats Prof. Right mentions in the course, follow and learn from the teachers he talks about.An't be more grateful for this course."
13843,"His course is brilliant.The lectures are full of information, but they're also funny, engaging and always enjoyable. And there are loads of them (25 his?), so this feels like quite a thorough introduction to calculus.Some of the exercises are pretty tough for a newcomer like me, but the answers are always thoroughly explained. The lack of a hard time limit is very welcome because it gives you time to take in new ideas at your own pace, without rushing you through assignment or tests.That's more, it's all free. Oats off!"
13844,It requires commitment. But is a must for any researcher or a data scientist.
13845,Essential in knowing how your company makes decisions based on numerical data.
13846,Amazing to get a grasp on the concepts! Right need further immersion on the Expel area
13847,Well structures initiation to functional programming with Scala. You convey very well the midst required for functional thinking. Thanks for making this course available !
13848,I especially love the professor's enthusiasm and passion for helping everyone learn cutting-edge machine learning knowledge. I would say it would be me to blame if I failed to learn machine learning. Or. G has done his best. The rest is really up to me now.
13849,"An not find a single flaw in teaching, and in assignment design."
13850,Very useful course to begin with patron.
13851,Great content
13852,"Great course, excited :)"

13854,nice and interesting
13855,Very useful and practical.
13856,Great course!Coursera ... not so much.
13857,"my first course about economics, helpful!!!"
13858,"Short essentials in lectures, lots of practice."
13859,The lecturer and materials were excellent on par with an ivy league institution
13860,It's an exceptional course on Coursera. Course is a bend of theory and wisdom lectures from Python founder and inventors in computer sciences. It's always pleasure to listen to Professor Severance.
13861,"Awesome material, challenging but very rewarding experience!"
13862,Fantastic overview course!
13863,"I learned a lot from this Machine Learning course! It was rather general, but that was what I expected from the first course in the series. In my opinion it was worth the money as the quality was high and it provided an extremely good starting point in this area. I'll definitely be purchasing the next course in the series."
13864,"The course is really excellent for beginners in machine learning, especially that it's not that hard to understand the materials as long as following the professor's instructions."
13865,"I took this class out of curiosity about our energy future and was pleasantly surprised! There were numerous teachers providing lectures on their expertise and the information provided for this course went explaining how we got to today, what we are doing today to energy in the future. It really opened my eyes as to what can be done now, and what is possible in the future. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with a curiosity in energy! Of you are taking this course for marks, take notes during the lectures. Awesome course!"
13866,"I enjoyed every bit of this course. Prof. Andrew G is a great teacher and a pleasure to listen to. In the course, he breaks down the complex material into manageable chinks and thereby creates a gradual learning curve."
13867,"Excellent Course, really enjoyed it and learnt a lot!!!"
13868,"not what I thought it would be, based on the into"
13869,The course was really insightful. Enjoyed a lot ! Thanks.
13870,Good Course for beginner in Data Scientist field. I recommend this course
13871,Very well explained course which gives great insight about balance sheet accounting
13872,Step by step description of different machine learning technique that allow you to get concrete usage of them.
13873,Interesting! Well organized!!
13874,"I find the course interesting in its vitality. It's more difficult than the first course, because of its theory but every piece one near another makes the whole!"
13875,"Well organized. Good introduction. Not that much information, overall."
13876,Wonderful course! Such effort is put in by Prof Andrew G. His course is definitely one of the best explained Machine Learning course around. Recommend everyone to have a look if you are interested in machine learning!
13877,Very information course
13878,"Wonderful course! Enthusiastic, engaged and well spoken instructor. A course everyone should take."
13879,Very explicit and cool learning.
13880,"I would recommend this course to everyone who wants to know much more about theory part of text mining. For practices, I'd recommend the data camp courses... I think the join of this platforms, could result in a better experience, because you can practice the theoretical knowledge gained here, regards =) !"
13881,"Great course, it would be nice to have more interaction and feedback from of's."
13882,A very good course for keeping your daily eating healthy.
13883,Sub in spanish ply

13887,West Structures course.
13888,It was an excellent experience. well designed course with up to mark quit
13889,Great course and assignment!
13890,Useful one.
13891,"Excellent overview of modern HTML5, a good start to the overall course"
13892,it was a exciting course
13893,"Excellent information about learning, and specially those technique that showed, are awesome. I really learned very useful tips to improve my method of learning. Thanks a lot."
13894,A fantastic course! The case study approach really makes a difference. I can't stand purely theoretical courses so this one really stands out. West of course online hands down.
13895,"I thought the course had good overall information and provided an online mapping tool using ArcGIS despite access and technical issues which I recorded in the forms. I felt getting rushed at the end of the course for the major map project and peer review and final exam all in the last week. The map project itself should be Week 3, peer review Week 4, then final exam Week 5. All students should use the same ArcGIS Online too for the final map project, instead of allowing everybody a free-for-all to use whatever map tool they wanted to including images. I was steered to be more lenient in reviewing submission of simple PDF or image map without interactive content. His made for an awkward and rushed peer review with little time to address access or technical issues. The final map project should be standardized for all students using ArcGIS Online for an equal playing field and applied learning."
13896,great for everybody !
13897,It was a very interesting course! Well-structure and nice to attend! I learned a lot of new things and I also had some ideas for using Art and Inquiry in my classroom! Thank you sofa
13898,Really good course.
13899,"The course instruction is very good. Of the Teradata database is improved, the course will deserve 5 star."
13900,Very useful course. Great!
13901,"I dislike the way the grade is settled. Because of the difficulty and technically of the course, passing grade should be 7 out of 9, instead of 8 out of 9. He are not the's, but student earners......."
13902,"Create course, thanks a lot"
13903,"His is a great course on research design! Especially if you complete all the assignment, there is definitely something you can learn from this course. (I mean, I teach research design and even I learned new things!)"
13904,"Great course, looking forward to Part of and III."
13905,I think it should be a more engaged course with practical examples
13906,I enjoyed this course. Matthew See-King is an excellent lecturer and is very well versed in the topic.
13907,"I just finished week 2 (of 6) and I feel like I am learning. I am taking this course because I am an entrepreneur and would like to acquire tools and technique and explore processes that can help me manage my company's projects. Though we are a year in, this is a great guide for starting to rein in runaway work and control the processes of the organization."
13908,"To far I enjoyed and learned to many concepts about programming, I have none technical background so for me this is like learning a complete new language with different alphabet, they explain in a clear way, with examples and easy language, the Javascript part could be more specific but it is fine."
13909,Super useful! But I think it should have more chemical about the reactions of food in our bodies
13910,It was great! Professor Miller the best teacher in my life. Thank you so much.
13911,His is an interesting course containing all the necessary basis for someone interested in Project Management. The instructor supports all the concepts with good use of interesting examples. I enjoyed this course thoroughly.
13912,"Very useful, smart & information course, thank you"
13913,Very useful course! Helped me clarify some aspects I was stuck on. It will also enable me to help others.
13914,"His course is very bad. I would like to say this course sucks compared with my sal course no matter how it is structures or how the instructor conducted the course. The instructor is very boring and does not explain very clearly. Even when I start, he does not clearly clarify how to start to use R. He was just talking about what the powerpoint shows. I will absolutely not recommend this course if you are beginners. (0 STAR)I will give a little credit to will, a practical tool provided by this course to learn R by yourself thought the instruction of the R program itself. But for the later part of will, it's confusing sometimes. However, I learnt much more from will rather than from the instructor. I can't understand what he is talking about but you have to make it clear thou using will. He said the will is an optional part but he does not realized what he shows is much worse than will. (2 STARS)Overall, I don't recommend this anyone, especially if you are beginners."
13915,Amazing showcase of usecases. To much creative freedom throughout.
13916,very useful and detailed and the professor is very smart
13917,The course was to easy for me. I expected more
13918,"Some very good explanations, especially by Michel Girardin. Some other courses lack explanations."
13919,I did the certificate course. I have taken embedded systems during college but didn't understand anything. The teacher here made it so easy to understand and also the assignment encouraged us to do self discovery.His was the first course I completed on Coursera. I am looking forward to more such courses and completing them with my new found confidence and discipline.
13920,"I wish it could have been a bit more challenging, especially towards the end of the course."
13921,"His course was EXCELLENT! It held my interest the entire time, exposed me to so much music I had not yet heard, and I am excited to take Part"
13922,"Amazing course with lots of useful strategics and approaches in learning. Reaches effective ways to memories, avoid procrastinator, & perform well on tests. The lectures are interesting and stimulating & the instructor do a great job emphasizing key concepts repeatedly in order for viewer to properly retain those ideas."
13923,"The course provides a good overview of machine learning methods. I would enjoy it more if it was a bit more friendly to those who actually know some path, as it could provide better understanding and insight about why and not how the methods actually work. I would also appreciate if programming exercises were a bit more complete and language diagnostic. Otherwise I really like the style of professor G. Thanks for the course."
13924,"In short, I am somewhat disappointed with the course overall. Of course both speakers have amazing experiences and that is valuable in itself but I do believe the structure of the lectures is not involving as it should be. It seems that the basic rational is being 'fired' in a not so much 'education fashion'. Still there is much to learn from these contents."
13925,Solid introduction that covers the basis of SEO.
13926,"His course was incredible! The video were interesting and included field trips and dialogue that made it spectacular and enjoyable to learn. You were able to take every grade assignment and participate even if you did not have money to buy the certificate. I learned so much and feel like my mind has been widened. I wish it had talked a bit more about how humans are revolving because that was super interesting, and a few test items would not grade correctly, but other than that it was perfect! Thank you so much for providing this excellent course for free for us! It must of took so much time and collaboration effort I applaud you for your generosity. It makes me wish I could go to this school."
13927,"I really enjoyed the course. Very professional training, with lots of insight in cancer therapy."
13928,Not such a great course. Lectures don't cover what is needed in some assignment. Week 3 assignment was the hardest I ever took. Must plenty of work to be done and small amount of that work is going to stay with you. There is a lot of space to improve this course.
13929,Perfect and enlightening!
13930,Good Ideas. Good progress.
13931,I though it would be a little more detailed. Thank you for the course!
13932,It helps me a lot.it is a good choice for you to learn it.and i love the teacher.
13933,I think the exercises were to easy to pass.
13934,A broad into and overview of many essential aspects of the financial world. Concise course materials.One suggestion: please improve the quality of quit parts.
13935,"It was very confusing some of the things for me, but I guess is just some topics are hard to understand thank you for this experience i learned a lot !"
13936,"Wonderful course for anyone with zero prior coming experience, or those who know other languages but want a way to grasp the important basis of Python."
13937,Very helpful! Great stuff to know.
13938,Great One.! A Kill Enhancement Course.!
13939,I have learned a lot about SEO from this course. 100% excellent course.
13940,"Doesn't provide as much of an in-depth into as I was expecting, but its a good course to get you started with horrid pp development."
13941,Awesome course
13942,"I was never a good learner of theories...they presented these lessons well. They use many American idioms. Of you can get past that, the course is a good learning experience."
13943,His course is very helpful for me!
13944,Incredible course!
13945,"In unexpectedly disappointing, and in fact, downright awful course. The lectures waste a good share of time as in places they barely scratch the surface of what is further required to be implements in the assignment. The assignment themselves inherit the nice nodular speck-test driven spirit of the first two classes. However, the instructions are mostly quite vague or even misleading, occasionally dropping some “hints”, which are often either not helpful, or just offer to copy-paste a quarter page of code. The tasks are very (and by “very"" I mean EXTREMELY) long, tedious, boring to tears and to the point when you start to wonder if the authors are rolling the students. Now about a 53 (yes, that is fifty three!) pages of assignment for the d week? To be fair, not all of this is the task statement, there is a lot of test code as well, but you know.. even one third of 53 is an impressive volume for a 4 weeks course (you get re-enrolled if you fail to be fair). Took me 44 hours of pure coming time (according to WakaTime) to finish the course. I have passed tens of courses on Coursera, and this one is by far the worst. That is taking into consideration that I would not rather call any other course (of those I have taken) “a bad one”. I suggest saving time and money by buying a book on Long and another one on Nails instead. I do believe though that the course is very green and certainly has to undergo some refinements and I will be happy to see future reviews shadow this one as obsolete."
13946,The course is very good.
13947,"I have taken a course about of, and this course is about not needing of. It's great to have different opinions, and this course offers an easy-to-understand format which consists of introduction of concepts and interviews from status and investors. Very good course for moving past theoretical ideas and implementation of solutions in real business situations."
13948,"In awesome introduction to software product management, covering all the essential information whilst being easy to follow and fun to watch and learn"
13949,Great course! I suggest to everyone interested in sports analysis to do this course. It is difficult to find courses like this focused on sports analysis.
13950,"I took this course 2 years (?) ago, when it was first online, and learned so much from it. I'm glad that the material is available ""on demand"" now. It's really one of the very best and demanding online courses I know."
13951,very nice course.
13952,"Great course, brought me to Github, myself would never do it."
13953,Great beginning for any course in entrepreneurship! Liked the way opportunity space is explained in course. Very clear delivery and language used.
13954,"I have learned a lot with this course! It's like you are really attending a class, and socializing everyday with your classmates. I really had fun. Thank you!"
13955,Great Course !
13956,love it. awesome material
13957,"Great course, great ideas and creative course and great assignment, really makes you think about clot of things in a new perspective"
13958,Or. Chuck you are awesome.The more i learn the more humbled i about feel how much work you have done just to let every one learn.His is first course i took because i wanted . Were in India its said you pass engineering first then decide what you wanted to learn or become .You have made learning fun . I really like when i have to fight with assessment tool to get my program to pass.Shaking your hand is on my Bucket List.-Vaibhaw
13959,"Words cannot describe how useful this courses have been for me, 10 stars if possible!"
13960,Good assignment
13961,Now what a course it is
13962,"His course is good, unique and relevant for machine learning today. Some things can be improved though. Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them. It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created (even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been). Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-unable. His makes experimentation (like grid searches) a bit tedious. Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skill for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.Finally, many thanks to the teachers!"
13963,"Wonderful course, I learned a lot!"
13964,"Awesome Glass. It did not add anything new to my experience because I am a computer science student; however it did refreshed my memory, I am super glad that I took this course though."
13965,"Very Useful, I start loving programming from this course, the professor is professional and cut, I have learnt a lot."
13966,Hope next courses will be more detailed.It is hard to understand some things without experience.
13967,Very good course
13968,"I again found many of the lectures to be difficult to follow along, there seems to be lots of different style of video in the way that the person was superimposed on the sides. In fact it was often impossible to read the text in the slide due to the size of the presented head which obscured the text. Honestly this data science course is getting worse as the months progress, you really should think of dating the content of the course if you want to continue to charge money for it. 2 stars as I did actually learn something despite the quality of the material and its delivery."
13969,Good introduction to data science necessary tools.
13970,"I've taken many, many Coursera courses and this is one of the best if not the best.Video presentations are given in a straight forward manner with real world case studies that demonstrate application of topic material. I learned a LOT primarily due to the interesting nature in which the course was structures and material presented.I cannot say enough nice things about this course and Professor Rates. Well, how about 'Outstanding""Thanks You!"
13971,"Very well organised, specially the lab work + assignment + Ruin."
13972,"Interactive course which allows one to see multiple perspective of the entirety of the Holocausts. The different countries, societies, and places are explored. The outside resources are great as well, from the photo, to the diaries, to the other speakers. It is a well rounded overview. Highly recommended."
13973,In excellent overview course for eyes who don't have the time to update the basis of the new Digital World.
13974,"Very good course, just a few notes short of excellence."
13975,Excellent Course. I really like the explanation and the topics. I 've learned a lot
13976,Excellent course well explained by Brian Jaffa with both theory and practical examples!
13977,Very completely!
13978,good.explains the lessons so simply and with a lot of examples so we can learn better.
13979,"Not your usual entry-level course. His class provides everything to get you started on real-world machine learning applications. Absolutely recommended. Hair warning though, it's donna require a non-negligible amount of time and effort."
13980,His was an excellent course that lays the foundation of everyday leadership. All objectives were met and the practice quires as well as grade quires
13981,Course is great with actual coming examples so that students can understand how the actual process happens.
13982,A very east to follow yet information-dense course that will give you a great rounding in of Design!
13983,"Thorough explanation, good pace for people that need time to take in the information."
13984,I suggest to include more and clearer examples to solve problems.
13985,Great course by great person!
13986,"His course is an excellent beginner's resource. The examples and detailed PowerPoints are a great step-by-step walk-through into the basis of HTML programming. I am a little frustrated with course's attempts to extract money from students auditing courses, but that is not this particular course's fault.Overall, I am a big fan of the michigan courses. The Python course is also great for beginners."
13987,Great
13988,"His was a good introductory course into clinical trials, providing an overview of its principles, features and design. The lectures were good and clear, and the accompanying sides were just as useful. I will admit to being occasionally lost on certain concepts, especially with regards to those which would've normally been covered in the biostatistics class, as Is. Rye mentioned once or twice -- after all, I believe this is a class which is probably offered in conjunction with others. That notwithstanding, I can now consider myself aptly familiar with clinical trials and what they entail, thanks to this course.I will say, however, that having just 10 questions in the quit is hardly neither exhaustive nor -- and I suppose this goes without saying -- a true test of a good grasp of the course. For instance, I'd read most of the supplemented material for Ethics (week 4) only to realize that that week's quit could've been passed using common sense alone. I felt somewhat disappointed by that. And also, while one lecturer was very clear in her presentation and discourse, the other wasn't really; more often than not, I was confused by her sentences."
13989,It's a great jumpstart introduction to get your teeth on patron and raspberry i. Professor Harris makes it a enjoyable trip to a new world of possibilities for enthusiast creator and developer.
13990,"Excellent course overall. Only issue was the inaccurate instructions for those using learn instead of graphlab (with graphlab it's very easy to do, but a bit painful for those like me who like to write a program instead of doing in interactive mode only)."
13991,A bit too basic
13992,Great MOOC!
13993,Run and helpful!
13994,I am very impressed with presentation and content. His course approaches the skill in a systematic way. It will be beneficial to all levels of users. I strongly recommend for nonnative English speakers.
13995,great course...u anna start a business? ..this is your index
13996,Very good course with hands-on lectures and an insightful introduction to real-world simple applications.
13997,"His Machine Learning class and the rest of the Machine Learning series from the University of Washington is the best material on the subject matter. That really sets this course and series apart is the case-base methodology as well as in-depth technical subject matter. Specifically, the step through coming of the algorithms provides key insight that is seriously missed in other classes even in traditional academic settings. I highly encourage the authors and other Coursera publishers to continue to publish more educational material in the same framework."
13998,"His really is a terrific course (but then, what else would you expect from Georgia Lech?) The content is well designed, Professor Egerstedt is clearly extremely knowledgeable and also a great communication, and the support team have been very active and helpful on the forms.I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in robotics."
13999,"I'm very happy with the content from this course. It is exactly what I was looking for in terms of information about music business. Really interesting and the professor speaks in a very calm and nice way to make our life better to understand the lesson and everything that is said, specially for me that I'm not an English native-speaker. Great job! Well done!"
14000,really helps to understand how to managing Agile team
14001,Challenging but very enlightening. Requires you to read the docs and figure out a lot of stuff on your own. By kind of course!
14002,Great course
14003,"A very enjoyable course that shows art can be appreciated in many forms, people of all walks of life and ages enjoy online games and that you can be anything you want with a little imagination.The course video are a series of discussions between the course tutor and his team of young enthusiast. Its an unusual method and one I thought was lively and entertaining."
14004,One of the most enriching and interesting courses for a 21 year-old Russian Saw student contemplation a career in of & of Saw. I'd like to express extreme gratitude to Prof. Wicker and his team for making this course a success!
14005,Good For Beginners... Must check out this course
14006,Awesome extension of the previous course.
14007,Amazing course which can change my life! I really hope I could learn this course 20 years earlier!
14008,"Whether you are an Entrepreneur, working in a corporate environment or even a student. His course will introduce you towards concept of social influence in all contents."
14009,"I like this course very much, it's easy to understand and to master some skill we might need in our life. Very impressive. Thanks a lot."
14010,"Well structures, hope there more guitar courses out there with more advanced topics, ply do consider making one, will be waiting :)"
14011,"I also took here HTML5 and CSS3 course. Again, superb instructor teaching JavaScript!"
14012,"Although much of the material was a repeat for me from other Coursera and ed courses, I thoroughly enjoyed getting the 'same' information from another point of view (and, making different parallels).Excellent course."
14013,Wonderful Course. His has very good explanation of Data Structures
14014,Great!!
14015,Maybe I was wrong but I expected more medical course with many practical examples and the course is st like 'explore your creativity in the field and be prepared'.
14016,"To good,but I think the examples should be using the Arduino IDE, writing the code, not just ""Open the example Made..."""
14017,His is an excellent course. It clearly explains what are the key functions of Management and what skill are useful in a Manager. It also highlight the importance of Networking in today's global environment.
14018,Great overview of the topic. Sides are information and exercises are relevant but not overlay burdensome.
14019,"I loved this course an the instructor. I got my confidence back on my grammar and punctuation, however, need more practice to reach the perfection of my writing. The flexibility to take the courses for free of charge is very much appreciated. Thank you Amy and UCI for your effort!"
14020,I really enjoy the course. Thank you
14021,Very good teacher/instructor.
14022,It's one of the best courses I've ever take!
14023,Its a very good course. His happiness course has provided me the knowledge to make conscious choice which can improve my happiness levels. Thank you.
14024,Very interesting
14025,"His is a really straight forward, practical presentation of valuable information every professional will have to deal with."
14026,Great information. Very easy to complete.
14027,Awesome basic course
14028,"Lips you into the direction of great resources, but sometimes lacks in the explanations, leaving most code not explained. Not a deal breakers, and a worthy introduction but a more detailed explanation at times would help."
14029,"In on rapped des bases, merci entire.www.brandelys.com"
14030,"His course was great, like other courses from this series. But this one was especially hard for me because it requires a lot of drawing, something I'm not so good at.But anyway, great course, recommended!"
14031,Excellent course. Very applicable in both your professional and personal life.
14032,The best course to grasp the fundamentals of chemistry
14033,Great course! High quality. Good peer review
14034,"Needs further explanations, good if you already have a programming foundation"
14035,"Excellent course, incredibly information and very well taught. Highly recommend to anyone interested in entertainment as well as the laws and liability involved."
14036,Now.. what a journey!! His course is a great path for someone who wants to have a gentle taste what a programming is about.. Or Chuck has done amazing job and sitting every evening on lectures and assignment was so enjoyable.. Thank you so much for an opportunity .. I have gained such a great skill thanks to your education.. what a great job! Thank you !! See you on Course 2!! ;)
14037,I am honestly not a fan of My's teaching style. The seems to have a discussion with herself about character building technique but not really explain the technique nor structure it for the student.There are too many shop talks.I would rather have a structure explained to me and then hear a discussion... the way Grand Skyhorse does in the Clot course... really a let down. I will have to buy the book she keeps averting I guess... after spending quite good money on the course already. City
14038,Very easy to understand. Suitable for psychological derbies like me. The only thing I regret is that some video links offered by the course are not available.
14039,"Great, the professor is the best."
14040,I enjoy leaning loads of things! Thank you!
14041,Anger is very well instructor. The course is useful.
14042,"That´s very nice course, my focus is Poultry and I did find very useful the information that i learned in the course, Thank you Coursera and Staff of the University of Edinburgh"
14043,"it's an interesting overview of the oil and gas industry and market. I'd have appreciated if it was longer than it is. Maybe, if they add another chapter about the economy it'd be better."
14044,The best online course I have ever taken!!The Instructor Or. Andrew reaches really great. I just love the way he reaches. The pace of the course is also good and not that hard to keep up. The assignment and quires are also simple and effective. One can learn a lot from this course.Thank you. :)
14045,"Practical to do if you are continuing with specialization. Ensures all students have the correct set, which is important. I'm not sure how useful it would be on its own though."
14046,"His session is the most interesting one since I enrolled this series of Python program studying. The technology I learned here opened the door of using Python to organize and catch data from web. There must be big land behind and I want to pay a visit, by additional work after this."
14047,"It's a well-taught course, and very interesting too"
14048,Very excited to wrap up this specialization and go on a high note. Hoping to do an awesome capstone project at the end :)
14049,Very interesting course with the chance to access detailed interviews and extra material
14050,"Very satisfied with lecture material. Great job!Thank you, Yakov"
14051,Excellent course for both advanced micro theory the earners who wants to go deep into the prove and master (and up) level learner who wants to have a flavour of Network Theory. Professor Jackson is great in interpreting the intuition behind the theory and prove. His 8 weeks are great learning experience for me!
14052,"The contents were pretty basic for me, but they were presented clearly. All in all I liked the review this course gave me."
14053,Too simple course. It may be nice for junior.
14054,"Amazing - way more depth than the first course, and much narrowed focus. Emily reaches all courses here and gives into the path and usage. Programming hints are given but no more walkthroughs of the code. Assignment laid out such that you need to code the algorithms correctly in order to pass assignment. Emily has an excellent way of explaining the path/calculus/reasoning behind the algorithms and proofs thereof. Love it."
14055,Create Course!
14056,Really nice introduction to Machine Learning.It contains essential contents which is not difficult and also not easy.
14057,perfect course and definitely recommended to everyone who wants to understand and learn not only Scala but also functional programming. He aware that this course will give you the foundation and requires you to invest significant time to learn bits and pieces of functional programming and how those are implements in Scala.
14058,His was an excellent prime on how social collaboration and crowdsourcing works. Have a good understanding of the concepts involved when creating such platforms.
14059,"amazing course, recommended"
14060,"Course is simple, yet very effective! Had a nice time learning how to learn!!"
14061,Not some great recipe. His was a fun course! Would like to know even more.
14062,"Great stuff. Unfortunately, i am only 15 and i don't have any money to buy a qualification but thank you so much anyway for taking time to create this amazing course (and especially for making it free!)"
14063,"Great beginner course for someone that knows nothing about business. I took the course because it has been years since I've been in college and I'm was looking for something to help me remember how to study for going back for my MBA. Great outline, easy to follow, wonderful professor! Highly recommend but would look somewhere else if you are looking for a challenge."
14064,Subtitles of some video are not well done. I think we need more documentation in of
14065,The course was smooth and was taught in a simple way that learner didn't need lots of background in other fields. I enjoyed it and will listen to it more times.
14066,"Excellent instructor. He has made HTML5, CSS and JavaScript easy."
14067,Great and challenging course to learn data structures and algorithms.
14068,Great course. I just had to goose a bit for the last assignment but overall meets expectations. I now know what I did not about this little device !
14069,Great Course with great teacher !
14070,"Awesome course, as could expected from Yakov. Both his classes are superb"
14071,"In amazing course. Interactive, relevant and absolutely fun. A is a great inspiration."
14072,"Excellent course and the way Professor delivered lecture was very simple and understandable. Thanks to course, Professor and related bodies."
14073,I feel as if this course did a great job of building on the into course. The resources have been tremendous! I find that I
14074,Great course!
14075,Great introductory course teaching the basis of Fig Data and having some hands-on applications to work with.
14076,Great and very inform
14077,"Several comments, in general the course is well conducted,it is not easy to follow, but this is natural as it a very abstract subject. The exercise sets (peer-reviewed) where very instructive, but I think that the quires where a little too easy in comparison. I missed a little a more intuition view, a broader view of the subject as well as a review of more advanced applications and developments, such as infinite Salons groups, etc."
14078,"Highly rate course.A very good choice for young and seniors with addition or not. Very important to prevent adjective tends and to help addicted people, because Or Michael KUHAR explains very clearly and very simply with a choice of experiment and other examples, complex brain behavior. Thank you to More University and to Coursera too."
14079,I recommend this course for all beginners interested in management !
14080,Very well organised and an amazing course which gives you a complete insight into the basic terminologies related to Machine Learning and its applications. Andrew G' s way of teaching is brilliant. It helped me establish my foundations in Machine Learning. Thank You Stanford and Coursera both for providing me such an excellent course
14081,Thank you for this course. It's very useful for me
14082,Lots of information and interesting articles
14083,Vice course but be aware that this is at a very basic level!
14084,"It"" Awesome. Thank you."
14085,I enjoyed the course very much.
14086,"I love this course and the instructor. I am learning so much. The only thing i would change is to make sure papers from peers are marked in a timely manner. I have marked three papers, and have not had a single person mark mine. I hope this will not affect my ability to certify for your specially, as i am really enjoying my time here."
14087,His course really helped me to improve my leadership abilities and my team management. Very recommendable.
14088,"His course is so thorough and so concise. I am both impressed by the quality of this course, and incredibly grateful that I have taken it. His course is eye-opening and I think should be big MUST on everyone's list. His course is Q-U-A-L-I-T-Y!"
14089,I found this course as the best to start in Machine Learning friend very information and well structures
14090,Excellent teachers. Content and technique were so easy to learn.
14091,I enjoyed the course a lot and will encourage executive (marketing or not) to consider opening their perspective about marketing and the digital works. I will ask that some practice examples be updated to retaliate the strength of some new concepts (digital marketing is STILL considered relatively new domain to MANY). It will also make the course close to participants with fresh examples.
14092,"It gives some good birds eye view of the topic, but I wish the course had more in-depth discussion of topics and more technical material."
14093,Any thanks for authors!!!
14094,You can learn a lot and practise ;)
14095,"I absolutely LOVE your courses! I have tried a lot of Coursera and other online courses that bored me to tears, but you have mastered the platform. Your courses are so well built and I love your sense of humor!Some things that set your course apart from other courses:1. A variety of instructor. Seeing different people introduce different topics in the video makes it more interesting.2. Regular quires to keep me paying attention.3. Regular exercises to put into practice what I'm learning.Thanks for sharing your expertise with the world!"
14096,Very good course. Moved the way the course is structures and presented.
14097,"Of you want to see big improvements in your guitar playing, then knoll in this course. The course is well-suited for beginners with or without prior knowledge of the guitar. Everything that you need to know to jumpstart your guitar playing will be discussed in this course. Major takeaways from this course are the beautiful pieces and exercises that will help you have a focused practice session."
14098,Good and clear introduction to Python data structures
14099,"The course is not only very didactic and general in some aspects, it's also a course that reaches great unable content beyond the just ruby on rails panorama."
14100,I enjoyed this course because it gives you the keys to understand Machine Learning without diving too deep in Mathematics.
14101,"Liked this course, entertaining and challenging. Although Am not sure how useful method is in the real world."
14102,"Good course, clear and easy to understand some exercises were outdated as red laser doesn't exist any more"
14103,"Great course. I wish the prefers would specify graph, infective proofs and other prerequsites from the path domain that were required to understand the examples.Twitching to of and repulsive thinking is hard enough as it is - having to combine it with graph algorithms and other concepts, not necessarily familiar for OOP background programme increases the effort unnecessarily. That being said, good thing the course offered a review week."
14104,"Such more useful than the first course. It was very interesting to see that methodology has a different approach according to the purpose of the class that is not necessarily communication. Great experience Although I think that the questions for peer revision are so general and vague that one is almost forced to give a good grade even if the assignment is just a re-telling of what was presented on the video, sometimes even word by word."
14105,Great lectures. The course project could benefit from greater structure.
14106,"In my opinion, this course is a waste of time, it simply throws a bunch of links and terminology for you to goose and research. The project is interesting but once again, you have to do tons of research and take up other courses to fill the gaps (might as well do the other courses instead of this one).I do not recommend this course or the specialization."
14107,"Awesome, thank you for the great course!"
14108,"Vice course, very interesting."
14109,"Specially on the last exercise, there is a bit of a distance between the classes and the challenges. Other than that, the course provides a very good introduction to functional programming at the same time as it introduce the scala language construct and apt."
14110,"Very nice practical course, if you want to master Unity3D to build Of game Coursera-way and not use official documentation. But I don't think that the name of course is correct, because there is definitely not much information about ""modern platforms"" and it's differences - this part is given very briefly."
14111,The professor is clear in explaining and makes you feel part of the lectures. You learn the content and you learn how to really use what is explained. Amazing opportunity.
14112,its wonderful and simple to understand.
14113,To the point and information
14114,Excellent presentation of the subject matter with clear illustrations.
14115,"I Felt like this was a very in depth course, the reading material was very good. It times I thought the instructions video were very short - I would have liked them to have been longer, perhaps going into more depth about some of the topics covered in the reading materials - I was not fond of the written portion of the course - I would have preferred exam to the written portion.thanks."
14116,Really very helpful course for understanding the steps and tools required to explore the innovative field of data sciences.
14117,It`s a very good course that covers some of the most fundamental concepts behind algorithms!
14118,good course
14119,"I like a lot GEO-Information-Project, it is very interested in many ways, I never handle with this type of project, It is very challenging for me."
14120,Course is really good and covers TCP and UDP basis in a proper and simple manner !!
14121,Course is very good itself but assignment is very easy.
14122,Great
14123,Great course! should be in every school.
14124,Very very good course!
14125,"A lot of email etiquette rules are obvious, but using them is much easier when all of them are logical arranged. Thank you a lot for putting my knowledge in the right order and adding new facts! Hope, I'll look more professional when writing email to my colleagues nowadays."
14126,excellent teacher
14127,His is an extremely interesting course that delve deeper than just dog cognition by connecting the evolution and domestication of dogs with that of humans and apes. I thoroughly enjoy this course and will be looking for other courses conducted by Or. Are.
14128,"I have enjoyed Learning this course, its very information and I will recommend this course, the tutor is very information."
14129,David Will is simply superb with clarity and focus on small small things that matter for young writers and readers alike. Blessed to have attended this course.
14130,"One of the information sessions, West"
14131,Thoughtful and practical !
14132,It is much needed course. Helps in setting the environment for smooth flow of the later courses.
14133,Very good as a first time exposure
14134,"The material is so interesting that even though you're learning a lot, it doesn't feel like hard work. The only possible drawback is that it keeps referencing this citizen science (a similar concept to crowd pouring or open-source) program called Cognition. Cognition's this webster that allows you to play games with your dog that test its cognition, and uses the data from it to better understand how dogs think. You don't need Cognition to learn a lot and get a lot out of the course, but if you don't have a dog to play with or feel like spring for the fee (which again, are highly optional and not needed to learn from this course), you will miss out a bit. But other than that, it's fascinating to learn about how dogs think and how that's unique among the animal kingdom."
14135,"The topic is interesting, the course content is presented clearly, and the lectures are information. While the assignment can be challenging, they really help to reinforce the lessons.From what I gather, the class was recently moved over from an older Coursera model/design. His is frustratingly apparent at times. Some information can be difficult to find, particularly in the Discussion section. I would love to see this class updated to match the quality of some more recent classes I have taken."
14136,Thank you very much!
14137,"A very thorough and interesting course. Prof. Yakov is incredibly talented and keeps the lessons dynamic and he goes into details without making it tiresome. I'm happy to have discovered it and I would definitely recommend it to others, pure 5/5 rating."
14138,Great content for learning how to learn.
14139,Excellent guidance by the professor throughout the course. Really helped me a lot. Thanks!
14140,Great Course!
14141,too many video and texts.
14142,Great Course
14143,Thank you very much for offering such a wonderful course!
14144,Graphical Methods are taught in a very good way.
14145,thank you very much for this course. i had a really great time studying it and i hope this course will be useful for me in the future
14146,Great !!!
14147,"I thought this one was better than the first (two) part(s). Short, self-paced, to the point. Easy to follow and implement. Highly recommend this one. (All I wanted is actually the JSON part, but I got so much more.)Quizzes and assignment could be an pitch more challenging."
14148,"Such a fantastic course! Accessible resources, hints and tips, and useful and challenging assignment. I've really enjoyed it."
14149,Both the tutors are very nice and I like the way of explaining simple concepts and building upon them for higher level concepts.The course content is really nice. I wonder if part of Stochastic calculus and to's emma could also be added.Thanks for sharing such vast knowledge.
14150,"Great course for beginners in Bootstrap, like myself."
14151,"Right be good for someone looking for a casual overview?I really wanted to like this course, and was excited about the series. Very disappointing. Defended after scoring 100% on first three weeks and watching the theory portion of week 4. I was familiar, with the subject prior to taking this course; was hoping for a deep dive.Too many trivial short and low information density video. Handwavy mathematics. I would have liked to get a more solid idea of the depth of the series from the first course before committing money.Default software for the course has near-zero market penetration (per indeed.com), unless maybe you work at Apple -- not really excusable for something that purport real-world value. Yes, you can use other software, *except for the capstone*, per another reviewed: this is fatal.Presenters just not fully prepared to lecture on the topic: the nail in the coffin was the end of the week 4 lectures on fluttering: ""To, at this point, you really should be able to go out there and build a really cool retrieved system for doing news article retrieved. Or any other really, really, really cool retrieved that I can't think of right now. But of course there's lots of interesting examples. To go out there and think of ideas that I can't think of right now."" Really? Now about: ""But! Take two.""Any poor design choice for the presentation. Too much time spent writing things on sides that should have already been on the sides.Is of this review: no reviews on the last courses in the series, and some poor (but indicative) reviews of the other courses."
14152,"I really enjoyed it, having been a developer for a long time, it was interesting to see how the story card comes together"
14153,Moved the professor. To not like essay questions.
14154,His is a course given by a person who really loves and feels passion for the subject... and this is doubtless reflected on the course
14155,"Great course! Well prepared, brief and to the point!"
14156,"Excellent teachers and great contents, very hopeful for my life. Thank you so much."
14157,need to change the instructor and the way the course is being taught
14158,The Angular learner's best choice .Excellent course I have ever met.Looking forward to more course from Professor Yakov.Sincerely Thanks.
14159,"Vice explaining.Those things i thought i knew, even they were calcified further."
14160,Very good course. Very good introduction to some interesting concepts in software security. Well explained. Maybe introduce more practical exercises. They could also include references to places where you can practice the concepts learned. For example depositaries as vulnhub and others are sites where you can put into practice exercises. It however is a course that is very well explained ...
14161,excellent to introduce in classical music
14162,i really enjoy the course.
14163,His is a must do MOOC.
14164,"Very exciting, strong structures course, The most difficult materials in a simplifies and exciting declaration. Great lecturer ."
14165,I really enjoyed the course. I felt some quires were too hard for the material previously covered and required several attempts.
14166,Actually I think this course is a little too easy and not so information.
14167,Very well presented and information.
14168,Great course! I enjoyed it a lot!
14169,Excellent and Challenging! Learnt a lot and if you are working toward a certificate you really need to set aside time to earn a pass for each assignment.New stitches when it came to trading and assignment instructions. BUT the discussion board is really helpful and interactive. The of's also provide timely help.
14170,To fresh...
14171,"I liked this course very much:The lectures follow up in a logical, natural way and the topics are very well explained.Personally, I had more problems with the quires (5 questions each) than with the programming assignment. The examples were interesting and the instructions so clear and detailed that I found it rather easy to do the programming.Another point that is worth to mention: The instructor, Andrew G, has not only an agreeable voice and speaks an easy-to-understand english (important for me as a non-english speaker) - He ""transports"" in addition his own passion for the subject and gives a lot of applicable advice."
14172,useful course for writing.
14173,It was very enlightening and resourceful in terms of quality learning material. Thank you.
14174,"Very good course, but there are some places not too deep."
14175,Great course. Highly recommend.
14176,"The course is simple and unapproachable by all. His course is practical, mixing simple science with statistics, rules of thumb, and cooking demonstrations that most anyone can follow."
14177,easy to follow lectures. i really recommend this course!
14178,Hello. I really want to thank you to University of Rochester for this marvelous opportunity to learn without spending. I love music and rock over all that's why I decided to do this course first but I will keep on doing courses with you until I die.I also want to thank Professor Coach. He's very clear and accurate on teaching and his comments are very objective. Thanks so much for making me feel very glad. I've been enjoying this time so much for giving me a very clear idea about rock. Please keep on. I deeply thank you. By best regards.
14179,Good and Informative
14180,Material for the course is outdated.
14181,Highly recommended!
14182,His course was very useful to me! I'm a data miner wannabe and this course covers visualizations in a simple but very effective way.
14183,please there are need to evaluate energy production in financial statement analytical
14184,"Difficult, but after this you feel more comfortable about your skill"
14185,Quite information.
14186,It's away one of my favorite course and the reason I'm on Coursera.
14187,The information learned really expanded my concepts of learning. I now understand some of my previous issues in learning. The video and professors truly are experts in the field and make this course very engaging and entertaining.
14188,Very information but not very focused or streaming. The lectures on brain elasticity and such I found largely irrelevant to the subject matter. Maybe an attempt to make the lectures a little less 'wordy'. I know this is Buddhist which is notoriously filled with concepts and long minded explanations but I think a lot of viewer could lose interest. I enjoy the course but I already have a great deal of familiarity with Buddhist. I was a Vajrayana practitioner for three years. Maybe a course focused more on Shakyamuni and the basis of Buddhist teaching along with a few courses familiarizing listeners to terms might be useful as a preliminary to the following courses.
14189,a must have skill set for anyone working on agile environment. solid and structures approach on how to understand a problem and build a user story .
14190,His course was extremely hard but learning the concepts are worthwhile!
14191,"Great course, it gave me a good start in my career and I have used what I have learned!"
14192,It´s a great course!
14193,Great introduction how to get data from web data in different format and ways. It's really say to manipulate data jason from API West
14194,"It's a basic class, and easy and fun to learn."
14195,Really great course with prove and practical tips and technique.
14196,His course is one of the most relevant and superb Coursera offerings I have taken recently. I teaching business English online to professional and managers with multinational corporations around the globe. Since my lesson content includes all of the communication activities in this course ---- I was able to enhance my own knowledge and expertise to benefit our private sector clients. I learned new strategics which greatly improved my expertise. Thank you! He hope Coursera continues to offer such a top notch course.
14197,Very promising environment.
14198,very good program for absolute begins
14199,it is a good course to start the data science career. syllabus was well structures and training in methodical way.
14200,"By favorite online course ever. Thoughtful attention to detail, polished presentation, and helpful short of students made this topic really great. Thanks!"
14201,of course the best
14202,West way to learn about the Tender Spectrum!
14203,"Excellent course! I have some background in other programming languages and went through the course to reinforce the basic concepts and to learn patron. Overall, the quit and assignment are challenging to a certain extent and is perfect for beginners!"
14204,"Simple and useful, very well！"
14205,"It is a nice introduction, with important key points and good references for further reading. In a down side, it is kind of repetition and in spite of the obvious enthusiasm of the speaker, sometimes the lectures are a bit boring."
14206,too many information just to be said.
14207,"very nicely done course, recommended for all people regardless of banking. Reference material and video are awesome"
14208,"Good content, it explains with so much clear and simplicity! Really love the course!"
14209,"His course is fantastically created for expelling your concepts in Cava. The faculties are worthy of praise.Thank you Lodges, Wen, Hilton and Robert for creating one of the best courses in course and teaching us amazing stuffs in cava programming."
14210,"There is no words to describe how useful, accurate and helpful is this course! Thanks a lot for this chance to improve our teaching skill and ESL perception."
14211,"Fantastic course with a enthusiastic, personal professor. It was fun and information to hear the different viewpoint of the diverse authors as well as the relevant questions from the students in the seminar."
14212,peer review is not fair!!!
14213,I have learned a lot of interesting things about Machine Learning that for me was too hard to understand with advanced books. His course gives a clear and general view of Machine Learning subject.
14214,Great into
14215,"Its so amazing way to get back to the education, To Thankful to the authority those have organized such type of enlighten way."
14216,Very good course!
14217,"Very interesting course, great presentation, a rewarding experience. Thank you!"
14218,Perfect for beginners! :)
14219,"The course was well laid out, had us tread old ground in a great way (especially with those of us who are already in he field or took the earlier courses in the graphics design specialization) by forcing us to look at the basis as we solved design problems. While it's great that people review (and are even left tips and hints on how to leave a helpful review) I do wish there was some sort of word limit (even a minimal one) for them because oftentimes getting a review like 'Great', or 'Vice' while hastening don't actually help the student learn about what the person liked about their design or what failed."
14220,"Overall this was a good course. It does assume some prior knowledge/experience of programming, which makes some parts of he course challenging for a newby. However, I would recommend it to anyone beginning the R journey."
14221,"I like this Course so much,In this course nothing is prerequisite,Instructor is very good he explains every things very nicely.I thinks all the student can do this course."
14222,"A very well summarise overview about waste management, which everyone should learn. Great knowledge, this will be a good foundation for future endeavors ! Thank you so much, Am"
14223,"His course is the absolute best I have taken on Coursera. The teacher is very engaging, explains with ease is a very friendly professor that guides you effectively as if you weren't taking this class online. It is elegantly designed with in-video questions and helpful quires that are short and on-point. I liked the over-all design, it touches in the most important thinkers of Sociology but also focused on aspects that aren't always taught in Sociology classes. A great course!"
14224,It is a great overview on machine learning!
14225,"People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web services, to solve business problems, to work with sensory, drivers and roots. Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work.Python is an incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require.Py4inf and Python explained by C. Servance, is a great developing of the foundations in programming (first two courses) that will serve you well for the rest of your life, as well as a course that will give you a sort of try to understanding of what great things patron can do for you.I strongly recommend this course for anybody, who wants to start with information."
14226,Very solid class in terms of R's base clotting system. I wish Coursera offered an advanced class rousing on ggplot2 and the wider world of dat viz.
14227,"I would expect some more methodological material,\though everything else is fine"
14228,"In insightful course which helped me to pursue my learning with confidence even when it does not seem to work properly. By conclusion after this course is: He aware of your ""mechanism"""
14229,"Engaging, information, and interesting."
14230,A very good and effective course on Machine Learning for learning Machine Learning from the very beginning.
14231,"Brilliant course! It offers a deep understanding of the subject in a delicate balance between working with the guns of the machine learning algorithms and getting the general picture. On't begin working on a machine learning project before watching week 6. Or maybe you should, it definitely sinks in more after you've had a go at wasting your time :)"
14232,really helpful and necessary
14233,Some of the video are really good. Unfortunately I feel there is little actual help to complete a project in the given time.The great thing about this course is the feeling of publishing your own game. That is priceless :)
14234,Gives impression what is goose cloud computing with some practical activities.
14235,"Great course, great teachers!"
14236,"His course was a complete joke. Any practice quit questions and even test questions had wrong answers marked as right so you had to re-write test over and over until you guessed which one of the wrong answers was right. Also, there was a theme of lazily worded questions and answers throughout the entire course. There is always a way to write in non ambiguous ways, it just takes some effort. Very frustration to decipher the lazily worded questions. Someone should have proof read this course. I feel like an idiot for paying for it."
14237,"One suggestion would be lest multiple option answers, but the course was challenging enough to learn valuable information."
14238,Martin odersky was great as a teacher. Interesting technique
14239,"Good overall theoretical and practical explanation of the material, I was also able to use spirit learn and hands without any difficulties instead of graphlab create."
14240,The quit is inspiring.
14241,"It is a really good course, it covers all the sustainability pillars with great explanations and examples."
14242,Great Thank you!
14243,Highly recommended if you manage content.
14244,Such love for this course
14245,His course helped me a lot to figure out how our brain works and we can take some benefits of this.
14246,"It's a great way to learn how to use Maltlab, gives you all the tips and hints to become a good programme."
14247,"The transition is from easy to advanced. It gets really confusing, not sure if it's just me. I am not following the lessons anymore so I left the course."
14248,"The course presents two core approaches to parallel programming - task and data parallels. While these concepts are really useful, I expected more details on, for example, how to implement the parallel construct used throughout the lectures. The materials were good and I can use some of the ideas straight after the lectures in my everyday coming, but the assignment were really slightly related to the topic.Varies But stimulation assignment. I'd say it has nothing in common with parallel programming in Scala. It looks like the authors looked for some real-life example or use case for Combiners and this stimulation model looked nice. But, really, does any developer not working in university would ever use it? It's completely practical, the most of the time I spent reading the description of stimulation model, but the coming itself was just playing with Of coordinate and some basic repulsion. I'd expect something more practical, e.g. implementing simplifies form of Hadoop map-reduce or something like that so I can use it after the course. But Varies-But is too specific and is pretty far from everyday problems developer encounter."
14249,great course and excellent teacher
14250,His course changed my life!
14251,Excellent Course for intermediate Python Developer. Really enjoyed it and definitely learned a lot.
14252,"Excellent quick course, reminds you of details that make writing more professional."
14253,it's my first course on course .
14254,Very good course. Interesting and get to know the important people in this field.
14255,"Amazing content, well presented, and very applicable to anyone who leads people. To much of what was covered resented at a deep level for me. I return to this course again and again for inspiration, and I share and recommend it with many other friends and colleagues."
14256,His course is very interesting and the content is pretty clear-cut and easy to understand.
14257,"Sides are easy to understand and and assignment challenging enough so that one can progress rapidly. To be taken after Time Valuation of Money.Once again, a great course by prof Paul ! Thanks a lot."
14258,"Good course, but I might have used a little more rigor and material, maybe more exercises would have been nice."
14259,Another great course by which!
14260,I learned a lot from this course!
14261,His course helps your game go from concept to reality. It pushed me to get a digital prototype made and ready to domo. Great depth of information related to game design and the gazing industry.
14262,Thank you. It least I know something about negotiations that I can use in everyday transactions.
14263,Awesome course !! Learned clot
14264,Excellent Course. I can't wait for part 2 after this course. Thank you to instruction for sharing their experience and knowledge with us.
14265,"Great course with solid content and concepts, i definitely recommend it.I didn't gave a 5 star review only because i felt that more examples were needed on module 4."
14266,Fantastic... Very helpful... Must what I needed!
14267,Prof. Stewart is amazing! He is able to take very complex concepts and make them understandable to a neophyte like me. Thank you very much.
14268,Awesome reminder to all that I had forgotten. It is put forth in an easy to learn manner.
14269,"Thank you! very interesting and ""easy going"" course!"
14270,The best Or
14271,"His is a great class! Highly recommended. Emily and Parlor are a great team. The video are polished, the progression through the material is well organized and everything just fits together very well in this specialization. The assignment are challenging enough to be worth the effort. Great specialization... I look forward to completing every class."
14272,the course contents are great and understandable but I have a problem with the lake of details information the instructor sometimes forget to provide..
14273,Very good! Exceptional in its explanation of the modern banking
14274,One of the best R-course course. His course elevate my experiences on advanced data manipulation.
14275,Very information course. I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Thanks to the Prof. for teaching it so well.
14276,It is a good course for the people who are new to programming. The instructor is really intuition and engaging.
14277,"The course is very well laid out to demonstrate the main features of R programming language. (To elaborate on one thing that I liked) The programming assignment for the th week (rating/choosing hospital based on outcome) is very helpful to try out what I learnt from the course so far. All the 3 parts of this question are connected well, and I hope the rest of the courses of the Data Specialization is also implementing similar format."
14278,"ModPo is an enlightening and mind expanding experience. Besides being about modern American poetry, it is a lesson in civility and possibility, in democracy, conclusiveness and individuality. I have learned so much in ten weeks and am staying on the course and learning more every day. I have endless gratitude to Prof Ll Filreis for being a great teacher whose kind email reminders and encouraging responses to earners' comments in the discussion forms help keep us all on track. Thank you Prof Filreis, all the was, senators and the whole ModPo community for providing such a wonderful platform and opportunity for the world. And free, too!"
14279,It´s a excellent experience for professional and personal life. The exercises and opportunities to review answers of other participants is a good way to learn how to apply the contend in different situations.
14280,"The course is a good introduction to Organic Photovoltaics. The instructor have done a good job to present a rather complicated topic in a manner that is accessible to a common audience.However, there are a few areas of improvement that can be noted for future versions of this course:First, All material is given equal priority in the course. I think what the instructor can do is to summarize the important ""take away"" at the end of each video lesson. His helps the learner grasp the concept betterSecond, The explanation can be a little clearer - especially the topic of polymerization. Someone without an organic chemistry background, can find it frustratingly hard.Third, the tests are sometimes not in line with the previous video lessons and the reading material. The tests should be much much sharper.Fourth, the reading material should be improved lastly in terms of English quality, structure and presentation of key points. Sometimes, the learner can find it hard to understand some topics (ex: stability and materials) because it is inadequately explained. These topics should be explained better.Overall, a great start - but can be better. Well done and Thank You!"
14281,The information in this course is very useful. Help me to understand one of the part of physical chemistry. And the lectures are very clearly To thank Professors for the course!!
14282,very good course
14283,It seems like the team have tried to do the whole course in one take! Perhaps some practice would have been in order? at least to work out what they are going to say next.... content is ok so far but delivery is tough to listen to.
14284,"I loved this course - the subject-matter was interesting, the instructor was entering, and the content was incredibly easy-to-grasp, fun and engaging. The retrieved quires were well space out and super helpful for embedding the new knowledge, and the expert interviews were great as well.Two potential improvement areas: 1.) The video fearing Barbara Valley (which was most of them) are very low-volume. I had turned up my device speakers and the video player volume adjusted to the maximum levels (and tried on multiple devices) but it was really hard to hear some of them without straining, and having to download the transcripts in order to follow along (which meant missed some of her hilarious visual). To audit issues with the other video or in my other Coursera classes. 2.) The practice quires allow you to see WHAT you got wrong in a given problem (and indicated what the correct choice would have been), and explained WHY it was wrong, but the actual quires don't reveal either. His made me feel anxious every time I got a question I'd gotten wrong on a previous quit, since I didn't know what exactly I'd gotten wrong or why."
14285,Another excellent course of the University of Michigan and Pollen van Went!!
14286,"I am loving it so far.By only concerns are about the platform, would love to have a help chat or somebody who I can talk to."
14287,"It was really good time to be part of this training program and I really enjoy my practical class. To thank you for giving me this opportunity!Thanks to COURSERA, Or. Charles Severance and Team for such a nice Course"
14288,Great course. May be expanded a bit with more examples from both developed and developing countries. Thank you all very much for giving me the opportunity to learn from you all
14289,"Interesting introduction course for people who want to learn Python. You don't need programming skill (though they always come in handy), because the course starts at the very beginning. I guess this helps everybody to easily adapt to the language, which itself in my opinion is pretty straight forward and quite easy to learn. I'm really looking forward to the more tricky and complex parts in the other courses of this specialization."
14290,"Overall, this is a very effective introduction to AngularJS. AngularJS can be intimidating or confusing, and this course is largely an introduction, but the video and exercises do a great job of letting you get over the initial learning curve. His course will give you a thorough foundation in AngularJS, way better than any other free course online, and will give you an idea of where you can go off and explore on your own if you're interested in going on to develop intermediate skill.By only critique of this course is that I really had to explore the ""additional materials"" at the end of each section to get a grasp of some of the concepts. I found that some of the video oversimplified pretty complicated subjects and weren't thorough enough to allow you to complete some of the exercises. I also think the course briefly introduces some pretty complicated tools too early to new developer and doesn't do a good job of explaining their value (like Grunt and Pulp).However, this course is still amazing for a free course. Of you've done any of the quick tutorials in AngularJS (like codeacademy's), you've really only scratched the surface of AngularJS. A hands-on course like this give you a much better foundation. To conclude, despite it's minor flaws, this is still the best free introduction to AngularJS online today. Good luck!"
14291,"The course is very good and useful for teaching students how to better learn and understand the material they are dealing with. One drawback, however, is that it focused excessively on test-taking and methods of succeeding in an undergraduate degree rather than a career. It would be nice and interesting to show how the technique being presented can also be useful outside of class. not just by examples related to great people in various scientific fields, but also by more general parallels. Otherwise, it is a very good course to help combat anxiety and procrastinator."
14292,Lectures are very confusing. Instructor should use white boarding to explain codes. Difficult to follow them.
14293,"I really enjoy the lessons because they show me the professional structure of the fashion industry and the main players in luxury. The examples were perfect to illustrate every chapter. It was interactive, worth and amorous. I enjoyed how fierce are Italians of the Made in Italy label and I understood a little more of this concept thanks to the explanations in the video. I recommend it 100 % !"
14294,"Excellent, interesting and provides some very useful tools and insight into how to study more effectively,"
14295,"Excellent. A little short on the exercises, but its my turn to experiment with code and keep practicing."
14296,"I really felt this course was well presented and easily accessed for working earners. Of you wish to build your skill in this area, this course is a good way to do it. By only hesitation regarding this course certains to the time and energy spent on historical or largely theoretical construct, such as what Plato thought or did not think about the nature of reality. To me, this should be an applied learning course given its nature and spending time and energy on this seems an academic exercise of little importance to the ability to understand research."
14297,Great and interesting course! Highly recommend!
14298,"Not too hard and really interesting. Or. Barbara Valley is such a wonderful teacher that will make you love the course!! Besides, all the knowledge is quite interesting and will be USEFUL in the future for sure."
14299,"I do feel that I learned from this course, though I almost feel that it was too easy to earn the certificate."
14300,Or. Chuck is so nice and this course will not even be boring bus of his fabulous teaching! Really learn a lot of useful stuff of Python after this class set!
14301,Excellent course! It was a great refreshed for me on HTML and CSS. It has been a great and funny introduction to Javascript as well
14302,excellent content & treatment with thought provoking video & transcripts
14303,"Such knowledge delivered in rather easy form, I'm happy that I chose this course, now I feel myself like a sherman."
14304,I have never been more impressed by a teacher. His is probably the best course I have taken and my instant love for Machine Learning got all the attention it needed. Thank you so much for this.
14305,It's really a very good course. I loved it!!!!!
14306,"His was a fantastic course! The professor is the best I have had yet; he makes concepts very clear and easy to learn, and he is constantly encouraging you as a student. He seems to really care about the quality of this course and the teaching that students receive."
14307,"The basis of Machine Learning explained in an easy to understand way. For people like me who are unfamiliar with Statistics the need arises from time to time to research certain things on your own. I would recommend just a little bit of familiarity with Calculus (i.e. derivatives) in order to better understand things, but certainly not necessary to make progress.Professor Andrew does a great job at explaining the concepts, and the programming assignment are very interesting and challenging.The course does suffer from BAD English submitting, but not exactly something that should put you off.His course is a great way to get started in Machine Learning, and paces the way for more advanced learning in the future."
14308,Really good course!
14309,"In excellent course even if you don't know nothing about that, it's very clear, complex and complete."
14310,this training gives decent background to explore more advanced neutral network
14311,"I've just started this course, that's why my rating is 4/5. But I'm very satisfied with the video lecture, and I find it very interesting so far."
14312,"It is an amazing course to get a deep knowledge about Machine learning and its various algorithms and applications. His course doesn't only teach us how to use these algorithms, but also how to use them efficiently and correctly. It also reaches us ways to improve the performance of these algorithms and warns us about potential mistakes/strategics which we should avoid which will save us months of time from being wasted."
14313,A good introductory course to programming in patron
14314,"Excellent, well thought-out course combining aspects of TBL and West practice on Leading."
14315,Excellent course. Must the right amount of work and time for an into course. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.
14316,"Duke.... Coursera... guns, come on! I'd like to contrast this with the Phaeton Business Analytics specialization that I'm completing. It was like night and day. I mean, professors in that course are presenting their own research! Made Passed presents research he did with Sick Thaler! One of that happens here. The information shared doesn't even flow smoothly.His course relief mainly on PDF sides (if I wanted to read, I would've bought a book). It one point, it even links to 6 articles on another webster (and that's in the quit as well). It seems like very little effort was put into this online class by the professors. The sides themselves seemed scatter-trained, several times asking questions that are never even answered. It was almost as if someone took already prepared sides from a course and just kind of washed them with a very little bit of video to make an ""online"" course. Even the answers to quires seemed extremely vague (it often felt like there were several right answers... or none -- to me, this is floppy quit writing).I honestly expected better from both Coursera and Duke! The only redeeming part about this course is that behavior economics is honestly compelling, despite the shortcomings pointed out."
14317,"I do not recommend you to waste your time. Planned course activities for a week - just 13 minute speech of the lecturer, telling absolutely canal things and a few questions. Absolutely useless."
14318,It's a brilliant course. the senators are very good and they use common English which is understandable to all
14319,His course is really a good choice for begginers who have no idea about programming.
14320,"I love this course! I have learned so much, and the quires are so nice and short. They don't give me time to stress!!!"
14321,"Love it from start to finish. I will teach anyone to know how to properly operate a camera, even a phone's camera."
14322,"His course presents you patron-database accepting concepts via quite, if you are trying to learn accepting Oracle or anything other enterprise database product consider this as alphabet"
14323,Excellent Course. Any thanks.
14324,a lot of great and helpful knowledge
14325,Fantastic and Practical
14326,Professor Empty covers an extensive subject using a clear and instigating language. The assignment and tasks proposed helps a lot the comprehension and make you search for more information.One of the best online courses I have already had.Congratulations to Professor Empty and all team that produced the available material.
14327,"Very common part which we normally miss up have been carry out for review and study which can truly enhance the skill for management, however some of the part seem to be remain just theoretical and hardly bring out for practice base on my personally view as senior executive.Clear lecture presenting do career coach especially for fresh graduate.Slide show given for clear view and note make are great for study.Overall this course came in with great presentation and crystal clear information given."
14328,Exercise need to be more heavy
14329,"Teacher was organised and coherent, lectures was clearly planned. Students however didn't seem particularly engaged with wide variance in understanding."
14330,In interesting approach to the French Revolution time. (8/10)
14331,The course is nicely paced. I was able to go through all the video and assignment within a day or two.Prof. Yakov Chaikin is very skilled and makes his video fun to watch. It is amusing as well and educational. Really liked the video about the Restaurant Visit and how to talk to a customer and what to expect and how to deal with issues in the process.
14332,"His is a very old fashion way of looking at development and developer. There developer are considered resources and minion that need to follow orders. Modern development technique value developer and allow them to be much more active players. Product Manager is not a MANAGER but a facilitate. His course describes the view that developer are loose canon that need to be managed and that front planning and estimation are the right path. I do not agree at all with this view.Should you happen to agree with this view, the Course is well explained and presented well."
14333,I loved this course and am using the things I learned effectively.
14334,Great Course!! Everyone should take it!! An be applied across discipline and easy to use program.
14335,Very useful program combining theoretical and operational tools.
14336,"I am enjoying this course a lot. Is a storyteller with screenwriting experience, it is interesting to learn of how the story dynamic work in the world of Same Design. Parish is an engaging teacher and he provides a lot of good material to work with, as well as references."
14337,I really enjoy the video
14338,I like its its pushing me to think and motivate myself for progress...and I'm only just in the initial stages ..so from the beginning it has my enthusiasm.
14339,Excellent addition to Dino101 and marine reptile (which I am presently completing). Deep them com
14340,woooooow this is awesome I have a new value thanks the colles
14341,His is a wonderful course.
14342,I would like to send my thanks to this source.
14343,"His is a great into to machine learning, but it needs to be polished and updated. There's too much discrepancy over the assignment descriptions and the tutoring discussions. Tom Other is fantastic in the tutoring forms - would have spent many hours wandering aimlessly if it wasn't for his guidance. However, he does point out many holes in the course as it currently is, and I'd have to agree with him. Linear algebra review should absolutely be a requirement prior to the beginning of this course."
14344,Covers fundamental theory well and examples and exercises are chosen well to make it practical.
14345,Really interesting and information. I highly recommend!
14346,very comprehensive and good introduction to Bootstrap and jury
14347,Heavy contents.. Unable to cover a week's material in a week
14348,Very good and interesting course with lots of information on how to negotiate.
14349,"Great introduction to of principles, responsive design, and client-side tempting."
14350,"Solid class, enjoyable and well suited for beginners."
14351,Very interesting course.
14352,"Overall, this course has very solid content. In fact, this is one of the few (probably the only one) advanced mathematics course on Coursera. More specifically, in order to take this course, you need to have good understanding of group, field and ring. In other words, you are assumed to have taken general undergraduate level abstract algebra courses before.However, there are some aspects of the course that are worth improving. First, probably due to the nature of online course, I personally find learning Salons Theory online very challenging. The lectures themselves make sense. The practice problems and quit, however, sometimes do not seem to be enforcing the lectures. The materials on tenor product seem to be unrelated as well. Usually these are covered in a course on commutative algebra. In addition, there was almost none communication within the discussion forms.Overall, I would definitely recommend this course if you have good background in general abstract algebra. After all, Salons Theory has long been a capstone type of course. Of you have some background but not solid, it is definitely still double."
14353,Clear and streamlined. I wish it could go deeper. Moving on with the other courses on the subject.
14354,"I have enjoyed the course work which was straight to the point and has provided the much needed knowledge on various aspects of strategy. May be this course can be title as ""Strategy-as-a-journey"" too..."
14355,Thank you for this Lesson Plan temple and explanations of each of the stage!
14356,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It was very insightful for me. It gave me a more rounded understanding of what appears to be driving infrastructure investment debates, as well as political and economic decisions both locally and in my own country."
14357,"His is one of the best courses I have taken. Scott and Maxim are very eloquent, incorporate lots of materials, studies, and practical approaches to leading a successful team, and I truly enjoyed this course."
14358,In excellent wake up call any time in your career.
14359,A very information course for those who dreams about studying in Japanese universities.
14360,"Not explained well, had to take another statistical inference course. Not worth the money."
14361,it was a good follow through suction along side my class lessons in school.
14362,"Superb course. Well structures, I learned a lot."
14363,"it's nicely designed, but it would be great if the course designer have their input in evaluation our projects and most importantly dating the material to the latest swift version as this is the whole purpose of why one would register in this course."
14364,easy to follow
14365,In effective way of delivering problem solving technique & tools. Liked the pace of the course which suited my schedule.
14366,Excellent and clear instructor.
14367,"Great course, the professors are passionate and very information."
14368,"Good for beginners, it's challenging but once you dedicate to the course, you definitely find it useful and motivation"
14369,Very nice for beginners.
14370,"Great short course on how your brain works, how to memories things and use them on practice."
14371,"The course is effectively a tutoring on how to use proprietary software to solve a range of machine learning problems.I liked the fact that the course covered a wide range of problems quickly. There were however two issues that I did not like.1) It is not well supported and given that the technology is proprietary, there are few other places that offer support (i.e. you can’t just look at problems and solutions on stackoverflow to get insight into the teach)2) For a course labelled as “intermediate”, it presented very little detail. Most of the course was dedicated to explaining particular problems, the solution to which was inevitably “then you train this really clever, one-line algorithm we have written for you and you query it for insight”. I felt a little created by this approach to a subject which should be really fascinating.While some of my concerns may be addressed in follow on courses, I am left with little insight into what really lies ahead. For example, is this really an “intermediate” course? That background do I really need? Will we ever get to the detail or will I always just be expected to call someone else’s brilliant algorithm and accept the result."
14372,Vice and fast into. Must the requisite path used and taught.
14373,Not enough information on how to approach the final project. The project itself is very time consuming with lots of self learning and unclear specification.
14374,Great introduction. It covers a wide range of issues concerning waste management and I thought the material was relevant and reflected my own observations of waste management in developing countries.
14375,"Very repetition content, provide only some abstract presentation of the mechanics used."
14376,"Of it was a dish I would say ""Delicious""! A way to expand programming horizons!"
14377,Thank you for allowing me to audit this course.
14378,"Modern and Contemporary American Poetry is an amazing ten week course which I would recommend to anyone who has an interest in poetry. Ll and his team of of's create a vagrant and fun environment which helped me to develop a greater understanding of poetry.The discussion forms, the interaction between fellow students and Ll and the of's, and the occasional guest Poet really gives a personal touch to the proceedings.The weekly broadcast were engaging and insightful and I really appreciated the fact that the times of each recast was staggered to suit the 'ModPo' community worldwide. A really nice touch guns, so thank you from Europe, (does that still include the of?!) In Ireland we are five hours ahead of Chilly time.His is my second year to take the course and I look forward to taking it again."
14379,"His course is great! It is more advanced than other into courses, and gives you a solid foundation."
14380,Very good course.
14381,"One of the most interesting and engaging courses I've ever taken. Really awesome! I will continue exploring its contents for a long time to come. Also, granted, I will continue looking at the many resources recommended by Or. Freemen at the end of the course. I look to music today from a far richest point of view than six weeks ago. Thanks a lot!"
14382,I found it really useful. Thank for creating this course. I recommend this course for anyone who feel suffered by learning new things and anyone who want to improve learning.
14383,"The course is a bit of a show. Maybe that's good for teenager and Millennials, but not for me."
14384,"His course was really helpful in understanding the basis of Mandarin and gave me a little more insight into the Chinese culture and mode of thinking. Chinese no longer looks like an impossible language to understand. Love it! Would love to have a few more printable notes, though."
14385,Really a great course
14386,The course is simply excellent.
14387,"His was the most arduous undertaking I have ever been through. By frustration is not with professor Wobbrock, who is obviously an expert in his field (though sometimes I felt like he's speaking in ""High Valyrian"" and not English). By disappointment lies with UCSD which included the course of such depth of information and a strong requirement for understanding R, without much thought on whether students will be able to follow. I feel that going through this course was largely painless, because I'm not going to retain much of the depth of the material in the long run.Based solely on this experience, I'm NOT going to be recommending this specialization to anyone."
14388,Great beginning for physics
14389,Easy to follow and well structures.
14390,"Father philosophical then mathematical. In accumulation of simple, but essential and interesting reflections on what game theory is and how it relates to reality. Thank you, it was very enjoyable!"
14391,Course was excellent. I liked the hands on sessions the most. Not too easy and not too difficult. They encourage you to explore more and learn more.
14392,The course is very practically-tormented and the quires are actually designed so that the learner can make a strong emphasis on the weekly content.
14393,Very useful course
14394,Great way to understand the fundamentals of SEO and to begin a new career.......Thanks Rebekah !
14395,Great course for understanding the complexity of developing countries...Thanks Prof. Each
14396,"Great professor, amazing course. Wish more assignment."
14397,"Moved this course. Very well presented, organized and illustrated. A gem."
14398,Very excellent introduction to the biology of cancer from a high level University.
14399,"Whether you are a non-medially inclined student seeking to make sense of the vast landscape of health information or a person with a strong science background looking to apply your skill on a global scale, this course is for you! Caught with a mix of engaging video, lectures, and interviews, Or. Old breaks down the complex terms and information surrounding global health in a way that is engaging, information, and practical. You will learn about the global burden of disease, the health concerns facing certain countries, as well as key strategics the global community and even individuals can implement to improve health outcome whatever your field of specialization."
14400,To time loss through this course.
14401,Great course - thanks!
14402,"I really liked the course. Ha manner of teaching and the subject with all the details of ""how to"" are attention catch. Unfortunately just had no time to complete it properly and in time."
14403,Good course. More problems sets would have been great!
14404,Really helped me learn more wisely.
14405,"Great course, hope you keep the good job. Thanks Coursera and Or.Chuck"
14406,"Mostly preparatory material and set activities for the rest of the series. It's of, but not a revelation."
14407,"Lovely structure of the class combined with illustration, interview and cooking is the best part of this class.The contents are very helpful as well!I really recommend this class whoever wants to know about nutrition and change your diet habit to healthy way."
14408,Super for beginners and for advance Expel user
14409,Week 2 was way too difficult but everything else was just right.
14410,"Thank you for this course. It was interesting and helpful. Before.But I failed. I got bad mark and I don't know why.I have only one good comment. But I have 3 bad marks and only 2 good. I am a loose, i guess.To I hate this course, this webster, this review system and this world.Thank you again."
14411,"Its really helpful, its not only theory guns !, they designed it really well using sound effect and animation.Thank you so much everyone to making this course."
14412,"I really found this course very interesting and applicable to my work and life, this is the one I liked more of the 3 that I have finished from the Up"
14413,It helped me to get some mental tools and master my rousing problems with studying. I also learned many new things which as a psychologist major I didn't know until now. Thanks for teaching me learning how to learn!
14414,"Really liked this course, great balance of theory and putting it to practice on current issues at work. Not such great input from other people in the course on the first two assignment especially - very insightful and actionable."
14415,I absolutely love this course. The only thing that I would suggest is going into the trapezoid and Simpson's rule when evaluation areas under the curve.
14416,"There is absolutely no supervision on this course. By essay has been sitting in a student review due for two months now - so, no completion of course and the program has the audacity to mark me as 'late submission'. I have reviewed 7 papers (requirement of 3) and am shown as being deficient. It is as if I dropped into a void.I paid a decent amount of money to attend this course and very disappointed that it is simply run on auto pilot with no place to go for resolution, questions or help.I would NOT recommend taking this course and would better advise you to find something in another online teaching program or course within Coursera that has at least a medium of personal interaction."
14417,"Awesome collaboration apes that you can see and learn about it, reactive apes done with Peter.is."
14418,The class is very interesting and the teachers teach me a lot.
14419,It was a fun course!
14420,"Great Professor and I really enjoyed the basic building block approach. It allowed me to learn slowly and completely while I took in all the new material. His was the perfect course for me since I had no prior programming knowledge at all. Thanks Or. Chuck!The only suggestion I have is to provide more exercises to really cement the lessons, similar to path class back in high school where you had to do multiple problems to see for yourself how different variations of the same types of problems work out. Although I may be alone in wishing for that!"
14421,"Honestly, His is the best MOOC I've taken in my life, and this course has helped me to understand what machine learning is, how you use it yourself, and many advice on applying machine learning.I started this course for a first step to building a real-life J.A.R.V.I.S.(still WAY far away...), and this course is really easy to understand even for a middle school student like me. His course is DEFINETELY recommended for beginners in A.I. and Machine Learning.Thanks for reading."
14422,Excellent course. Highly recommended
14423,Excellent course! The education didactics is really well organized and easy to follow through even for a nonenglish native as myself. It the same time is gradually challenging. I'm really grateful to Professor Or. Alter Sinnott-Armstrong for sharing his amazing knowledge with such passion. I believe that this course will influence my life in a long there basis and I look forward to beginning part of.
14424,"Great course which uses R to have you do classification, linear and logistic repression to address business topics."
14425,Very interesting and helpful course. Well organized. The first lecture is better.
14426,Well balanced approach that invites multiple perspective on ultruism. I would have liked to see the objections against ultruism of In And being addressed in the course but I suppose it is difficult to give a course that addresses all aspects of a given topic. But In And had a definite contradictory viewpoint and it would have enhanced the class tremendous if it had been considered.
14427,"Really good teachers that made a ""boring"" theme (that I had in college) very interesting to watch and study."
14428,It's a great course. You'll learn a lot and you'll be totally happy if you can apply the knowledge from the course in the real world. And it's great if you already want to learn some basis before you start studying at a college or university.
14429,"I could learn this course in the ""step by step"" way, by refined assignment."
14430,Professor Sect provides a very thorough and understandable class in Managerial Accounting. He miles application with concepts. I've never liked accounting until I took his courses. He's a phenomena teacher.
14431,Seemed like pretty basic stuff for the cost of the certificate.
14432,"Pretty great, must say. The teacher is enthusiastic and quickly while knowledgeable and learnt."
14433,Great learning! The way the professor taught is commendable.Even a novice can benefit and learn clot in finance through this course!Thanks to the whole team.

14450,"The speaking style and body language of the instructor was quite monotonous when teaching the content. For the most part of the course, it felt like the instructor was just ""reading"" the teleprompter without blinking for several seconds! He did not attempt to teach the students in these video. It could have been MUCH better if he had used better presentation tools and shorter sentences."
14451,"It is so helpful, and the professors really teach so well!"
14452,"I've never valued tests, nor flash cards, nor anything that I perceived as gimmicky learning tools. Learning was just learning. But I was wrong.Understanding your cognitive behavior and how memories and knowledge are formed has helped me grasp learning in a new intuition way.I highly recommend the course!"
14453,"I found the course to be well paced, and it provided very useful information."
14454,"Awesome Subject , awesome instructor and that implies this is a awesome course. :)"
14455,excellent and very interesting
14456,"His is an excellent course to get some basic knowledge about the in and Android history, when and how this systems developed their unique features, or how that influenced products in whole. Met, quires are a bit boring. They require you to actually know history of revolving features tied to exact dates/versions."
14457,His course is very helpful! Thanks so much for Professor Think!
14458,"The course is great, but I hope I can get to the final project. I have a little bit experience in patron, so I skipped the first two courses of the specialisation project. But I still want to try the th one, which is locked to me now~"
14459,nice course . short term for non-financial people

14471,"The course instructor was such a fantastic teacher! Being a beginner at game design, I found myself learning a ton despite the short video (though these video were so fun and entertaining to watch). I definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in getting started in game design! After completing this course, I feel much more confident about taking my game ideas to the next step. I now even have a rough draft of a board game that I created throughout the course, which I plan to eventually turn into a polished 2 or 3-player game!"
14472,"Excellent course! I already knew a lot about R - but this class helped me solidity what I already knew, taught me lots of new tricks, and now I have a certificate that says I know `something' about R!"

14478,"Difficult but valuable. You will be watching the video repeatedly and become a regular at StockOverflow but it was completely worth it. Getting, cleaning, and processing data is pretty much 80%+ of the job, this course's information is vital to any future data worker."
14479,A fun way to get introduced to what once was boring calculus.
14480,His is probably the best online course I have done to date and it's definitely a course everyone should do before they try to tackle other more complex courses. The lessons you learn here are guaranteed to stick with you for the rest of your learning journey.

14605,good. its a worth your time
14606,The course is easy going and broke down into an easy way to case yourself week after week.
14607,"I learned next to nothing from this course; the professor just rubles on and on jumping schizophrenically from aspect of aspect. One moment he's talking about physics, and in the same sentence he's suddenly talking about whether the game should have a grafting system. Some of the information even seems out of touch.He doesn't state any information with certainty because he always tends to add ""or not!"" or ""...maybe!"" after sentences, leaving you to wonder if there's anything left to take away from the lessons. The entire course could be condensed down into a ""list of questions to think about while designing your game world"" - it really doesn't contain anything more than that.Sometimes entire segments are dedicated to trivial things (such as ""your game could have invisible walls!""), whereas in other segments he works through a hundred different questions without going in-depth to any of them.Speaker is hard to understand due to his lack of proficient with the English language and the subtitles are often incorrect.In the plus side, you will learn what a ""ha-ha"" is."
14608,Or. Chuck rocks! :)
14609,Is a grate course. I have already rate it. It would be good an International Humanitarian Saw and a Hours about the Tea International Saw. Specially Tea International Saw.

14619,Insightful and lively lectures. Manageable assessment tasks. I would recommend this course to anyone.
14620,"I watched all the video, but did not do the coursework.I was a total beginner on the subject. The video were very well made, and quite nice to watch.However, I feel like the material was a bit too easy for my taste. I would have enjoyed a course that delve into ""harder things"".For someone who doesn't like as much ""hard challenges"" as I do, I do think that this course is a nice introduction to the subject."
14621,excellent course. Met up a great foundation for doing advanced Python courses
14622,Great Course!
14623,Very good and inspiring course!
14624,Very good but brief course.

14707,the best thing ever in my life
14708,That's great!
14709,"His course tackle two difficult topics- sequence and series. The instructor does well to build insight and conceptual understanding instead of just teaching how to solve problems using the formula just as in his previous course. However, I believe that this course is more difficult than the previous one and earners may be stuck at some points in the course if not armed with the right tools and technique. Also it takes some amount of reviewing before you can understand some of the concepts."
14710,Very good overview of the relevant concepts
14711,"Very Very good and Funny Teachers of this Course, i recommend you , you won't believe all the skill that you have and you did not know about it"

14718,"Very good course, I can't wait to continue the rest of the certificate."
14719,Excellent course! Very hands on with right level of theory and application. Prof. Schweidel is obviously an expert in this field.
14720,"Highly comprehensible course, structures information, valuable resources."
14721,His was a tough course and I actually moved to another schedule. I think a sixth week on using expel to solve problems would have been worthwhile.
14722,It was really a lot of fun to work on this course and on the programming assignment. The programming tasks were information and interesting. I'm now looking forward to build cool applications and to learn many more things in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science. Thank you very much for this awesome course.

14748,Great course for those of us coming back into school mode. Thank you Or Valley!:)
14749,His class was excellent. I loved hearing what had to be said and the viewpoint I was given. It was like I was actually there walking among the people. I felt myself protesting and fighting against racism. It was interesting to hear about all the different players in the movement and what they did.
14750,"Great course on the basis of environmental law an policy, very easy to follow and engaging for the audience. Still, would suggest to update some issues e.g. GHG as the Paris Agreement was ratified recently. But overall I would recommend for everyone interested in environmental issues as it was a great introduction."
14751,Excellent! The way the Professor explains the topics is very clear and engaging
14752,A lot to learn from this course
14753,"His a great course to get you started with Python , even if you're new to programming all-together. Or. Charles Severance is one of the greatest , most skilled tutors I've ever seen and his effort in this course was mainly focused on conveying the most basic building blocks and concepts of programming in general and applying it using Python language. Definitely a great course."
14754,Fantastic Course.
14755,"so cool ,professor makes students understand well"
14756,A great course for beginners. The teacher makes it easy to follow and fun. I love it!
14757,Awesome second part!!
14758,Compared to previous two courses in specialization this one is far worse - it is more of excursion into used methods than actual learning using any of mentioned methods in enough detail to be able to do meaningful analysis.
14759,"It's pretty good for entry-level SQL earners. However, to further improve, much time is required. Also, exercises provided are sometimes really weird."
14760,Such an information course
14761,It is a must have course for everyone.
14762,"Excellent course, very helpful"
14763,Moved the overview of the profession and hearing from real data scientists (among others)
14764,In exceptional course with a really good material.

14766,I really loved this course. Useful information presented in an attractive format. Hands on approach. It opened my mind regarding a lot of possible applications in different areas of life.
14767,Bandy and Informative
14768,Good course for beginners!
14769,His is a lie. I do everything. I complete week 2 and now i come back to watch video about week 3 and i see that i dont do anything.An you imagine ?Good job guy.
14770,Great course!
14771,Really great course. I like it.
14772,"His class was great to understand the basis - what is SEO, why SEO is needed, SEO terms and creator."
14773,One of the best courses which i visited.The explanation was so simple and there were many examples which were so helpful for me
14774,First two weeks are great. The third week becomes a bit disproportionately difficult. The autograder is very flexible.
14775,Provided Unity script for projects don't work properly with newer versions of Unity. Quality of video recording is kind of happy esp. audit. Most of the stuff learned in this course you'd be able to learn straight from the Unity tutorials anyway. Not recommended unless you absolutely need schedule assignment in order to learn.
14776,"It's hard, yet it's really good."
14777,"Powerful tool to help master courses you never thought you can, Barbara and Merry was amazing, and all the team"

14780,In interesting and eye opening course that was intriguing and fun. Thank you for teaching me about learning!
14781,"His is a great introduction for a professional who seeks to understand his co-workers in of. The concepts are explained clearly and concisely, everything that is presented in the course is useful and to some degree build upon previous material. Recommend to those who are interested in the topic."
14782,"Great course, expected from Berklee."
14783,The tips and principles are quite useful even for a different cultural background. I recommended this course to a friend who just had her baby back then.
14784,Must Awesome
14785,"Well, Met's time to prove this course is worthy."
14786,"I have had some experience using HTML before, but needed a refreshed on HTML5 and inaccessibility. His was a great way to brush up my skill, get a reminder of the basis and build a better foundation for creating accessible webster. I think it would be great for a complete beginner as well."
14787,"Superb course, and very engaging lectures!!Thanks so much, Or. Chuck and Coursera team.Will look forward to more advanced courses on this topic from you now..."
14788,Moved this learned a lot.
14789,Very good introduction into the practical aspects of machine learning. It's also great that students can work with a free Atlas version for the duration of the course.
14790,Really an awesome course!
14791,To I receive a Statement of Accomplishment?
14792,Great!
14793,"I didn't find this course particularly helpful or useful. I'm not sure why, there was a discontent somewhere, I think maybe that I didn't receive the help that I feel I still need on the subject of how to create a great, memorable, believable character. Also, some of the assignment were confusing. Nothing really stands out about this course, and it was actually a bit boring and I don't feel I learned anything related to the subject. Everything about this class needs some work: the video, the instruction/syllabus/content, and the assignment. Sorry, I didn't like it. =("
14794,"Excellent course, very well explained with a lot of examples and intuitions. The practical exercises are very well structures to make you think of what you were taught in the class. The teacher explains every part very well with a lot of examples and real case scenario. Of you want to start learning artificial intelligence this is the place to be. There are many algorithms you are taught and many good practices that should be applied to this algorithms to make them effective and performance. Something nice to have, would be the written courses or some paperback with the main ideas, but the video are downloadable which fills this gap pretty good. Overall this is a nice course and you definitely should attend it if you're new to machine learning or want to better consolidate your knowledge."
14795,Very good course
14796,"I'm sure this is a fantastic introduction for those with no prior programming experience, but as someone with even just a little bit of prior scraping experience, I found it extremely slow-paced. Father than suffer through the lectures, I did DataCamp's Into. to Python and then did all the quires & assignment for this class as extra practice."
14797,"I knew about modeling already, but this was a good refreshed and it includes a minor business concepts."
14798,In excellent course for environmental conscious individuals interested in the different option we have to create a 100% renewal energy future.
14799,"When I started TESOL course, I didn't quite understand this module. Now, I'm almost at the end of part 2 of this course, and finally, I have a better understanding some this foundation principles. It's a great course for anyone who wants to understand basis of pedagogy."
14800,"THIS of A FANTASTIC COURSE!!!I can't believe the secrets these persons gave here, are so simple and unknown.THANK YOU REALLY! You have changed me, and I am sure you changed the other persons who studied here.Greetings, and God bless you!"
14801,His course and material does not articulate the 'Google Loud Platform' offerings. Maybe Google does not want to compete with Microsoft Azure and AWS alike. Of Google itself has approved this 'Google Loud Platform' training on Coursera then vol I am out. I am way better off supporting AWS and Azure (at least they have tons of good training and stuff to keep folks in the field excited).
14802,"Provided a good, very high level overview. I united so I didn't take the quires, but the questions were all on the general side. I liked how they used some examples of real-life research."
14803,It was well designed and very well depicted course. The faculty is superb and that's why the course has been so exciting. Really appreciate.
14804,"Vice course , i'm learning and i'm satisfied with the full courses Each English Now"
14805,"I never had programme before and I'm very pleased I have achieved making a little game in 12 weeks. Now, programming isn't a strange thing to me and I feel curious enough to continue to learn more."
14806,"Well done, but perhaps a little bit more depth required (foe somebody with 30 years of experience in large organizations)."
14807,"The courses are extremely helpful and Professor Whitman reaches amiably with great clarity.And I have a personal suggestion: the questions in quit are great and challenging, but I don't think they should be challenging in calculation. When I did not have my calculated with me, there was nothing I could do to deal with those weird numbers in the questions.Anyway, I really love the mechanical engineering series and hope Professor Whitman can put on more courses."
14808,Dynamic course with well presented into.
14809,"I have been studying and practicing Buddha Mamma for nearly 20 years and I would say this course is excellent. The lecturer is informed, and is able to combine ancient and modern knowledge in an illumination manner. The lecturer is enjoyable to watch and is open to suggestions and constructive comments. Overall this is an excellent introduction to Buddhist and Modern Psychology and how they inform each other in a mutually beneficial synthesis."
14810,"Now I can continue the course, there is no subtle in English.Finally i get solution."
14811,"Thankful that a course like this exists, as most MOOCs are quite basic. And thanks to Coursera for running the courses even though attendance seems to be low (dark, that sky calculus pre-requisite). Lecture quality is varied--some quite good (such as the lectures in Foot Camp I) and others seem like he hadn't looked at his notes for a long time. It's great to hear a states professor talk about the strength and weaknesses of many approaches. It complements a mathematical statistics book quite well. It would have been nice to have had some problems that were more challenging. Overall, while the John Hopkins Data Science MOOCs are pretty good, they are a bit more basic than what's available through MIT and Stanford."
14812,His course is a very information & comprehensive course for Beginners. it covers the foundation aspects of of design. Thanks to Or. Rosa I. Arriaga & Georgia Institute of Technology.
14813,"Overall not a bad course. Needs some tiding up though. For example, the assignment seem to assume knowledge of functions not covered in the prior lessons. Same applies to the textbook, e.g. page 50 refers to the sunset() function, but it is not actually covered."
14814,Good course
14815,"Great course! I like that there was lots of material for things that I might have not studied before but were necessary for the course.Assignment :I understand that getting people to tune PID mentally gets them to understand things better, but mon, not every single coursework!"
14816,"His course has achieved the impossible simplicity. Father than presenting many concepts just theoritically, the course has focused on examples and metaphor. The course instructor has done also a great job."
14817,Well done. Must the refresh that I needed.
14818,Excellent introductory course to Machine Learning. The professor lectures were simple to follow along and offered a good level of detail. Definitely one of the best MOOC I have taken in recent times. I absolutely recommend it.
14819,Very interesting and understandable. Great investment of my time. Any thanks.
14820,Absolutely wonderful! Susan Meyer is a fabulous teacher!
14821,I can't stress enough how much my view towards front end development changed after taking this course. And have never stopped using the tools that I learnt here.
14822,"Very interesting, really helps set all the ideas and things I knew in my head and just organized it and motivate me to get the important things done.Ironically enough I was procrastinating starting this course and as soon as I did it pushed me to go on"
14823,Very good MOOC. I have learned a lot Thanks
14824,It is great course
14825,"I learned a lot about Digital Studio Workstation, Synthesizers and even how to create music with code. The peer-rate exercises were a great way to actually create your own projects. Thanks a lot for putting the course together!! :-)"
14826,Met in and make the most of this. Awesome in 1 word ;)
14827,His would be a great course for someone towards the end of school or attending college/university. There is definitely valuable insight to be gained but it feels a little slowly paced.
14828,Pollen understands the struggles most of the students will have and addresses them in a effective manner. The explains the material in a way that is enlightening to novice and yet interesting to more experienced.
14829,"The course is clear and well-paced for someone who is beginner like me. The instructor was great. Even if you've worked with earlier versions of HTML, this is a good update to HTML5 and how to code cleanly, with good santa. The coming along lessons are both fun and challenging, so download Sublime or a text editor right away and try things out in your first lesson if you want to get the most out of it. Overall, this was a really good course. I am excited to continue taking the rest of the Web Design certificate ."
14830,"It's really great too see the history of Computers, Internet, etc.Fantastic to watch all the interviews with the people who created Internet, First Web Server, WWW.I really enjoy it and it feels like exciting journey back in time!Thank You Or. Chuck:)"
14831,"Great course. May is a wonderful teacher and inspired me to make better food choice for me and my children. I love the recipe, too."
14832,Very interesting and well organized course. I really enjoyed it. Thank you so much for it. It was very helpful for my new teaching challenge.
14833,"In amazing course content!! His is a very enjoyable course about Python language programming. Or Chuck explains each topic with clarity, which facilitate the comprehension of Python from the beginning. In my personal point of view, I would like to have a more deeply exploration in topics. It could give more tools to learn and complexity to each assignment. The book as supported material is a very good resource for consult through all course."
14834,"Excellent course! It gave me an excellent introduction to a wide range of bootstrap components. I learned how to use bootstrap and its CSS cases and JavaScript components in my site, how to use bower to manage my project's dependencies, how to make some very basic functions using query and how to use Less and Pass to preprocess my Stylesheets in a more handy way. I loved this course, because even when it seems to be very basic, i feel la I know a lot about this technologies i've learned. His is a must if you're new to bootstrap or some Web Development tools based on nodes like Power, Pass or Less"
14835,Quite easy to do it. I was expecting something a little bit more challenging.
14836,It's good lecture to understand what is machine learning.
14837,"A good and information course on the philosophy of cognitive sciences. Judging by the lectures and quires, the course does seem to be more on a high school level, than an undergraduate level."
14838,Very good and useful with excellent assignment
14839,i have reached my professional goals thanks to the courses i have taken on course.
14840,Awesome course to be studied by everyone.

14848,Excellent course in every way!
14849,Course is information and organised. I would like to sincerely thank both the professors and their team who put all this together.
14850,His course was extraordinary well presented. It dealt with important theories and political philosophers and helped me a lot in deepening my overall understanding of them.
14851,Is not as bad as I thought at the beginning (the first two weeks). It gets better the third week. I think it needs some improvement though.
14852,Great course!
14853,A thoroughly organized course! given the time limit medical neuroscience topics were nicely coveredProf. leopard White is a very dedicated teacher and one can see his enthusiasm in neuroscience. I am glad to have an experience of teaching by Prof White through this course. A great teacher is the one who not only reaches but inspires. i am inspired and would continue to study in depth. Great teacher! Great human being! Thank you so much Air!
14854,Very efficient tips and hints on our brains ability to learn.
14855,"His class was actually about responsive web design, NOT information design. The two are in no way synonymous. Information design is about the visual display of information in a way that aids comprehension. Responsive web design is about creating different interface for different device form factors. I'm not sure how a professor could possibly mix up the two, but he did.The only reason I'm not giving it 1 star is that there was, in fact, some interesting into about responsive web design. Of Coursera would change the title to ""Responsive Web Design"" instead of ""Information Design"" I'd give the course 4 stars."
14856,Very practical!
14857,Great. Thank you.
14858,His is not a course - this is a 90 minutes lecture.The idea is great. But this lecture is only start. Its very brief and not profound.His more advice and not scientifically tormented.
14859,"I spend a lot of time enhancing my software skill, but in this course I realize that I should also work on my soft skill!"
14860,Very useful course for my self development
14861,Excellent contents with lot of learning and enhancing professional exposure
14862,"Very good course overall. It gave me some good thought suggest to keep in mind for the future. It times the course felt more like it was trying to sell the notion of home cooking rather than being about ""food and health"". Sometimes terms were hastily presented and maybe assumed to be common knowledge, which left me confused in one of the quires (""serum triglycerides"", for instance).The course touches on interesting topics that could've been elaborated more on, for instance how translate are made."
14863,By best of the th courses on Conception Garphic (impossible to register to the last courses which is Grand New Grand...)
14864,A great course!
14865,"Really great class for Machine Learning. I went from being knowing nothing about Machine Learning to knowing most of the in and out of it. Of you have been hearing a lot about Neutral Network and SVMs in your day to day life, you're probably in the Computer Science community, and the reason you hear about them so much is because it's being actively used almost everywhere. A good understanding of basic linear algebra is certainly going to help you in the class, but it's not necessary for completion. Thank you very much prof. Andrew G. It has been a great class!"
14866,Practical and very useful for job hunting.
14867,Lecturer is pretty good
14868,His course has taught me so much and is very detailed and in depth. I recommend this to anyone
14869,"Great course, packed a lot into a short time frame."
14870,Not much explanatory
14871,It helps me a lot to gain a basic understanding of machine learning. I believe what I learned here will do a great help to my future research and life.
14872,Interesting and practically applicable course content. Really no particular prerequisite - UNIVERSAL.Enjoying doing the course. Great Stuff!
14873,Thank you for providing awesome material.His lectures help me a lot to study machine learning.
14874,"His course is structures in an intuition and easy to manage way. The lectures, who are clearly highly intelligent, package their knowledge in understandable and easy-to-grasp ways that are in no way alienating - which is what I initially expected the course would be."
14875,Useful information and very well explained.
14876,"Amazing course, thanks to the was"

14881,"Great course, it gives you the basis of construction management and an overview of important topics surrounding construction."
14882,"Great course for practitioner, educators, and almost everyone wants to lead a positive life!"
14883,"A brilliant course for both beginners and experienced programme. The professor carries along with a steady pace and has made good problem sets to increase learning. His lecture style is so inspiring , information and sometimes funny that i find myself spending most of my time in this course. Hope people at Vanderbilts continue to produce such valuable courses in the future."
14884,His course was really nice and it taught me fundamentals of programming in R
14885,Thank you.
14886,The assignment had nothing to do with the lectures. The teachers do a poor job of explaining basic concepts and theories. The class is a lot more advanced than the class description makes it seem.
14887,Great course. Vice retracing of some notions of the course Same Theory like Caret Oprimality. Vice idea doing some examples on auctions and voting systems. Vice proofs
14888,"A great course, and it is very interesting to think over the issue that was put forward by the professor."
14889,"More number of hours are given than required. Good learning for non of field people. For people with of background, its too easy."
14890,In invigorating subject to learn about. Learning made great by the lecturer!
14891,"Brilliant course, with a great lecturer. Well structures, and readily transferable in the skill developed. Thanks!!"
14892,Very interesting course and very well done.
14893,Real easy and fun way to learn about data structures.
14894,It is a great course if you want to learn about environmental technologies and how they work in different places around the world. The experience from several professors of the DTU is condensed in easy to follow and understand video.
14895,Amazingly interesting topic presented in a well structures way.
14896,His course helps me tremendous in my work career.
14897,Outstanding course. Case Study model is awesome
14898,Excellent! To insightful! Thank you
14899,Excellent teacher and very good course
14900,I loved it....
14901,Great course
14902,"Unlike the HTML course which precedes it, this course was lacking information and structure."
14903,Amazing course. Thank You course
14904,C
14905,Good material. I'd prefer the course going without graphlab though. I hope course 5 will be produced one day.
14906,"Great course! The course covers fundamental concepts and terms used within the field of epidemiology. It also strengthens the knowledge, understanding and design of the different types of studies that may be useful for scientists in basic science."
14907,"I wish I had taken this course 25 years ago. That said, this comes at a good time -- I'm rioting my career. It really feels like applying these lessons could get me from an okay trajectory onto a great trajectory. His is the missing piece!"
14908,"Clear, Easy to follow, Practical"
14909,I am an amateur dog trainer and this helped me out considerably in ways I can improve my interactions with my own dogs to make my training sessions be more productive. I'll be raising a litter of supplies soon and am looking forward to watching them grow and develop their own cognitive profile so that I can make sure they all go to the best fit homes.
14910,Yakov is cool as always!
14911,Thank you for this course I really liked it. It is very helpful
14912,Excellent teaching
14913,"His series is taught by Emily and Parlor. Course 2 was Emily and this course 3 is Parlor. Parlor takes a more practical approach by showing how things are related using pictures, trial and error, what happens when we do this vs. that. Emily on the other hand gives down into the path and actual facts. I feel Emily is more difficult overall - but once I got through it, I had a better foundation and intuition as to how things work and better overall understanding. To - giving this class 4 stars as compared to Emily's class that is 5 stars. I feel if they would mix it with Emily doing the path immediately followed by Parlor explanations it would be best. Finally - I don't feel this course on classification had as much content. He could've done more."
14914,Well explained. Brilliant material.
14915,Great Course.
14916,"really, it is very useful course."
14917,"The instructor were engaging and most charming in the video.Most suitable for programming earners taking the step from beginner to intermediate level. The material was divided into fun bite-sized video, quires, and assignment; but still thorough with the details that were necessary."
14918,Good course. It would be nice to have 1 or 2 healthy meal recipe at the end of the course as an example. I like that I can work on the course as I have time. The only downside is posting comments for each chapter because it is not an active discussion.
14919,I am experienced in C++/C etc and some 50% of the video i had to remind.The assignment are really good though
14920,"Personally, this course is interesting and essential for the learner to proceed to other more advanced courses, either within this specialisation or not. There is only one suggestion that it will be better if the instructor can provide more details of the pseudo codes."
14921,"Really organised, simple, the teachers are awesome."
14922,"Great, based on practice. A very good start"
14923,Assignment could have been harder. That is most code was as easy as copy paste from sample programs.
14924,"Great course, excellent delivery. Thank you Or Pollen van Went"
14925,His course is very easy to understand. Because of this it's oversimplified
14926,Learning a lot of practical information in order to work as an entrepreneur
14927,Good content but the communication is not so great.
14928,"I've learned a lot from this course, i help me classify 5 roles of a manager, understand the important of Reaching and differentiate between fact and thought and guide me the way to coach my employee. Thank UCD, Coursera Team!"
14929,"His course has very good balance between theory and implementation. Through this course, you will have very good ideas about what, why and how."
14930,Professor Less is amazing!
14931,Very helpful. Thanks.
14932,The quality of the course is not as I expected from a Coursera course.
14933,Excellent course for those who try to understand eastern philosophy from rational point of view. Also explains more clearly the effects of meditation and why it worth to try. His course shows that there is nothing mysterious or supernatural in this practice.
14934,Great course.
14935,His is an awesome introduction course to of!!!!!
14936,"Great Course, Moved it."
14937,Very good course- simple to follow video- not so long that you can concentrate- and its fun as well. Very well researches course- I like the way the optional reading are grouped by module- this helps pace you correctly and give you the flexibility to explore a particular topic further. Bandy practical guidance on avoiding the happiness mistakes we make day to day- I didn't realise so many I make myself. Thanks Prof A and team!
14938,"Great curriculum, both theory and practical part."

14952,"Great course for anyone interested in private equity investing and the venture capital world. Simple, straightforward and a great teacher for the basis."
14953,"Personally I had trouble with week 2 of the course. I think more details on the types of input and output with some examples would have been useful. For example, I'm still not sure whether buttons are considered tactile or electronic input. It might be obvious to others but I can see see how it can be argued either way."
14954,"I hope there is a series Learn to speak Organ 1, 2, 3. That would make my day!"
14955,very comprehensive for those who has a little coming background but new to R. The programming quires are very helpful for practicing coming. I suggest solution codes by instructor be posted.
14956,Very nicely taught. Short and precise
14957,sir i am very sorry i didn't do even work because my college timing so disturbing me i kindly say to you my apology and i want your context you always connect to my whatsapp number sir if i have any doubt i say you and my new think and invention even i have to show you

14959,Helped me with my writing skill.
14960,it's very good course
14961,"Vice information about Modern and contemporary art. General information, with good resources."
14962,"His is by far one of the best courses I've done at Coursera. It served the purpose I had in mind, as a practical review of many basic human services process and procedures. I recommend it for both the induction to and review of these fundamentals."
14963,"The course is well document and interesting to learn the intricacies of several sanitation system and its relevant technologies, with several case studies all around the world."
14964,Not of learning in this course compared to the first two courses.
14965,It is the best course to start Machine Learning.
14966,"His way lecturer explained about each topic really very good, covered all required topics. To His is really helped for me.Thanks to Yakov Chaikin Air."
14967,I took the course out of curiosity and really enjoyed it.
14968,The most relevant course I have done in Coursera
14969,It was well worth the wait! The instructor was good. Assignment were challenging as well as hands on!
14970,"I like this case study approach, it shows people what you can do with machine learning, a lot of stuffs in a relatively short amount of time."
14971,"Tremendous course, with high quality examples and problem sets."
14972,"Chinese is become more and more important, especially in my city Bangkok.His course is great, and easy to learn!"
14973,It could be better if the program include the actual process of risk evaluation such as RCCA.
14974,Had sound quality
14975,Really helped me to learn scala
14976,"Content is not excellent, the trainer is just reading a text while sides are passing trough the screen, no examples, no analogies, no explanation whatsoever, I wouldn't call that a training. I'm quite disappointed."
14977,"Very interesting course that gave me an excellent overview of the project management process. But, I would have liked more practice with a capstone project for example!"
14978,His is one of the most innovative courses that I have seen. It really helped in thinking out of box.
14979,"The course is supposed to be very information. It is in fact. But after I spend hours raising my intellectual level trying to understand what they're talking about, I still have no idea what is the purpose of the meditation.Or rather I have it, but from another source, from a person who's been practicing it for 20 years. In 10 minutes I was given a crystal clear and logical answer on what is was all about. Unfortunately this course doesn't give this answer. It will rather improve your skill of understanding highly intellectual texts and will show you some interesting stuff about the brain."
14980,"One can understand concepts and fundamentals of SEO very easily, Very well taught by the instructor."
14981,"Warning: The lecture video along will NOT be enough to prepare you for the final assignment! He prepared to do your own research for the extra study materials. In the forum, many students said they had to drop out during the last week (probably without getting a refund!) because they were completely caught off guard by the huge knowledge gap between lectures and the final assignment. Of you are determined to get the specialization certificate, you should definitely start the final assignment as early as possible. On't wait until the last week or two!!"
14982,"While I greatly respect Or. White's obvious immense knowledge of the neutral anatomy, I feel taking this course did very little beyond showing me that perhaps medicine and anatomy wasn't for me."
14983,Perfect for learning patron or improving patron skill!
14984,Good introduction to the Data Science and the courses provided here in Coursera
14985,"Challenging course offered balance of study and testing: 3 essays, 6 short tests and one final exam. The quality of interviews, study sources and presentation by professional was second-to-none by Coursera standards. His course is demanding. Of you take the course you need to have a background in tax or be prepared to study over 10 hours per week. Of you follow the guideline and substantial source documents and presentations you should be able to pass the course. More importantly, rousing on the issues, ways and means that global enterprises have benefited from weak tax treaties and domestic laws is an eye-opened. Very politician elected to public office should take this course. Very done! Maiden's Centre for International Tax Saw is clearly a world leader in tax law study and assessment."
14986,I am enjoying this course very much! North time in it.
14987,Excellent course. I hope I can hear from the book you're releasing soon.
14988,"Very briefly introducing the background of data science, it is very suitable for beginners in this area like me."
14989,"Great Instructor/Course from great University as great as the rest of An Diego university courses. Well respected Universities in addition to Duke, Michigan and Virginia. Compared to the very short courses from other reputable Universities"
14990,"I have been taking online for almost 3 years now and I can openly say that this course is a very hands-on, structures module that I can recommend for beginners!"
14991,great course! highly recommend
14992,"Clear, practical, well done Andrew."
14993,Excellent! I'm very excited!
14994,Lucky to listen a valuable lecture by one of the most famous economist. :)
14995,Great course to start learning how to use database with Python.
14996,"great course, I was trying to learn how to control a quadrotor and at the end of the course I managed to control it."
14997,very helpful.
14998,"His was a fun & educational course, designed for folks with not much biology or evolution background. A few of the lectures explained things poorly -- I would have been confused if I didn't have a lot of background knowledge. Overall, a good experience."
14999,thank you
15000,Incredibly beneficial!
15001,It's new change to my career
15002,a wonderful opportunity to learn basis of entrepreneurship and The first very course is so helpful in starting the started works. I recommend every one who want to see the change around and want to be the change should enjoy for this course. I thank wanton for such a sublime initiative.
15003,Good tips for the double of.
15004,"Excellent course. I loved it, and enjoyed it a lot. Thanks for the facilitators and actors, you made it great.I liked the strategics given during the course, the interactive questions during the video. The bonus material is very useful.I would just recommend to make the peer assignment pondered and obligatory to motivate participants to conclude them, and participate in them. Or design some strategics for this."
15005,Very good instructions of the teacher!
15006,"Very good course. I look forward to starting the next ones, in the context of the of Specialization.One small cadet: I would have preferred using a more widespread and open source of library, than GraphLab Create, which I am not certain to encounter again in the ""real"" World."
15007,It's really great program to understand environment which surround us and performance of the professor is quite remarkable sample for other professors for their approach to their students while teaching so complex issues like these are .. :D
15008,"some for my wife , we need it!!!!"
15009,"Very good, but i think it needs more activities to feel more the approach."
15010,"Nothing but following the lectures, hardly any quires or assignment where you have to work things out on your own. Also, there's way too much material crammed into four weeks, leading to a lack of depth. I learned a lot, but this was not very engaging."
15011,Very good course. you gain good tools to make efficient and effective decisions.
15012,Its perfect for learning basis of English language.
15013,"some, nicely explained."
15014,"Perfect introduction to the digital world. Uric is not only succinct, he also brings to the table several very interesting and up to date technologies that will escape the online marketing landscape in the next years.100% recommended!"
15015,"Is a developer on multiple web application projects this was very helpful in defining, organizing, and prioritizing requirements/tasks."
15016,"I learned quite a lot that I can use for research, personal projects, and general understanding of neutral network, but unfortunately this course is getting quite out of date at this point. I would recommend to others looking for a first course in neutral network (for machine learning applications) look for a newer course."
15017,I really enjoyed with this course . I feel exciting
15018,"i like it in the way of trying some of the advice in real life. Some of them works and that's matter. I would be pleased if the authors can make a ""Learning how to learn - part 2"" course or something like that. Thanks for the knowledge."
15019,I have learned a lot from the lesson !
15020,"One of the best courses available for non European law students, lawyers, businessmen or anybody else who wants to know and learn about European Union business law. It gives you a brief overview of European Union fundamental law in the field of business. I highly recommend you to study all three parts of the course. Thank you Fund University. Thank you Coursera."
15021,To so interesting!
15022,"A really good course. And it's really fit students who have pass the course"" Python for Everyone"" and want to learning more about patron."
15023,Great course!
15024,The nearest of the series so far. Overlap with some of the other courses. Too much art therapy.
15025,"very educational,, helpful in understanding some of the procedures used in the formation of what goes into creating machine learning and some useful applications of what can be done with such tools ,done in such a manner that the novice can understand"
15026,Thank you for the opportunity. Impassioned course with thoughts and practices worth considering. I found that my willingness to create values for others connect me to other minds and flows of change.
15027,"Dear Or Less, thank you so much for this course, I am a young 25 years old entrepreneur from Pain and this course has really cleared a lot of things in my mind.It's been amazing assisting to this course, thank you and your team for sharing your knowledge and enthusiasm with all of us!"
15028,"Wonderful Information, fun and interactive."
15029,"Great course , I learnt a lot during this journey"
15030,"I Moved this course, it was great and I learned so much, I really enjoyed he way the teacher reaches the class."
15031,A great overview of the Organ Economic Development path.
15032,Accessible to almost anyone! with a sanctioning intellect.
15033,Frequent and forced peer reviews with no opportunity to complete once deadline is missed makes this course no-necessarily difficult for people with conflicting schedules and responsibilities.
15034,Great
15035,Ably length video with good blow sites to read on.
15036,The course is very thorough but i would have loved it if you had a way for instructor to better reach out to classmates rather than leave things to chance and everyone is confused for month. But either way the experience is priceless. Would recommend it to anyone
15037,"Amazing course, everything is explained in a great depth, assailants are thoughtful and engaging, I recommend it to everyone who is interested in Machine Learning, or passionate about that of dream.Thank you.Israel Lyadov."
15038,"Great course with very useful insight and technique, which would have taken me way more time if I tried to learn and develop it by myself. Totally recommend it."
15039,It is a very detail course. It was very helpful for me. I am very satisfied with it.
15040,"Clear, complete and well organised."
15041,His course is a wonderful introduction to distributed and cloud computing. Definitely go for it.
15042,Case study was superb!!!
15043,Very interesting! I am enjoying taking this course!
15044,"Second part of the specialization, this course will talk about Strategy Formulation. Like the first course, it's clear, concise with a final exam that lead us slowly to the the capstone project."
15045,Great course
15046,"I would have been great to have more examples of the different types of corruption, the analysis to fight it and the solutions behind it. A case-study method I believe is optical for this subject."
15047,Great Course!
15048,I am very happy that courses like this are now online.I thank Coursera team to facilitate the course.
15049,Exceptional! the way even the most difficult concepts have been explained in such a simple way to be understood! Will definitely look forward to more courses from this professor!
15050,"Is the entry level of the patron, it is clearly introduced the basic idea. I feel that it is quite easy to follow all the materials."
15051,"His course feels like a bad news anchorman reading the teleprompter. It gives a lot of formula without proper explanations. A lot of quit answers do not come from the video lectures. The course is really just spitting formula from the dissertation ""Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors"" by Daniel Warren Mellinger (easily found using search engines). Leading the dissertation before doing the course would probably help understand the formula they say out of context without the proper explanations. Sorry for the bad review, it's the first time I leave one like that, although I've completed many MOOCs. I hope it will help to improve the course."
15052,"There is no initial santa explanation, most exercises are done by copy and paste. That's good for experienced developer but difficult for beginners."
15053,Fabulous course! I learned so much from this MOOC and would highly recommend it to anyone in education.
15054,Or Chuck's lessons are well-paced and easy to understand!
15055,Great basic explanations of the concepts. Not too fast and easy to understand.
15056,A really good course! Simple and powerful.
15057,The teaching style was simple and to the point without adding unnecessary information so the points are crystal. I would recommend this to anyone who is learning there first or second language.
15058,His course fills a gap that is rarely taught by explaining biological origins of musical experiences. The material is very easy to follow. I wish there were more practical exercises or home works to play with the concepts.
15059,Thank a lot. His course gave me really brief insight what it is like to be in of industry.
15060,helpful!!
15061,Vice course. I had no understanding of this part of Iodism at all and the course really helped me.
15062,"Well thought out and designed. Great opportunity for those who have full personal and professional lives already, but who are looking for a structures way to self-reflect. Very manageable time commitment. There is as much to get out of the course as you want and as little to get out it as you decide."
15063,"Lectures are very easy and unnecessarily long and slow. I had to watch all of them on x playback speed to not die of boredom. Also, what is the point of breaking them into 3 minute chinks? Some people may need more time just for getting to the right mood to learn. I cannot imagine anyone watching 3 minute video, doing something else and returning back to it. Also, it requires me to start the next video and set the speed to x again.Overall, lectures are of and material is explained well.Programming assignment are worthless, as they are basically ""Will one line of code that does X. By the way, here is the santa. And here is the data to use."" To thinking required."
15064,"His is a great course. Although I have an MFA in Writing already, I learned valuable skill from this course."
15065,"nothing special, no significant knowledge gained."
15066,His was a very useful course that comes with numerous tools to get your home and work schedule organized. The professor is engaging and fun. There are also many video showing examples of the technique in practice to help you decide what methods might work best for you. I highly recommend this course to get your schedule more together!
15067,A first year undergraduate student can pass this
15068,A great course.
15069,His was a fascinating course. Thank you.
15070,Very clear.
15071,great course!very useful
15072,Fantastic approach
15073,"Presentation is so boring and dry, I could not bring myself to watching past the first couple of video."
15074,"New ideas, good teacher"
15075,"Very interesting historical background and a paced, clear presentation of the musical technique employed by the pianists. Very enjoyable if you are a classical music lover."
15076,"Great course! Teacher works at a great pace and doesn't have awkward hand movement (that drives me crazy!) Material is interesting and projects are a great way to apply what you've learned. Beer trading is spot, as always."
15077,"Summarized it up really good, made it engaging and interesting for everyone to learn."
15078,Everything you need to know to have a clear understanding of repression models and learn how to use their basic functions in R.
15079,"In incredible course! I advice it to EVERYONE: not only for students, but to everybody wanting to improve his/her memory skill, ability to fight procrastinator and concentrate on whatever you are doing at a specific moment.The lectures are the nicest professors I've ever seen in my life! I really would like to meet them and to thank for the work they do. Garb and Merry - you are my love, indeed!Good luck and happy learning how to learn!"
15080,"Lots of valuable information, very well structures & presented."
15081,"His is my first course in Coursera, it's so excellent a trip. The content is so friendly for the beginners to start with and the logic in teaching methods are nice, too. Hope someday I can continue my further study with again. Thanks a lot."
15082,His was a great course - Only suggestion would be to add more crony definition information for the layperson like me :0)
15083,In awesome course
15084,"Very basic, no new material or ideas if you've been interested in the subject for a while, but it might give you a fresh perspective on how to present some subjects to your audience."
15085,Insufficient information for the programming assignment.
15086,Excellent course to get up to speed on important statistics concepts
15087,Moved the course! I still need to review some topics to make them clear in my mind but I really enjoyed! :D
15088,The course reaches by the principles it is trying to convey. By progressively tapping into a subject and repeating and summarizing the teachers seek to build-up confidence in a warm-hearted way.
15089,"Very Useful, easy to understand, short yet information course for non finance professional to understand the basic concepts. worth every minute spent on it!"
15090,The best course I have taken so far in Coursera. th week up and running now. Determined to finish this.
15091,I loved this course. It taught me how to use this program and I am now able to work with my students at the library to run a root program that is similar to Scratch.
15092,All courses put together were excellent. His final steps just rounds up a great course!
15093,A great idea to create a project based online course. He should focus on application based learning not on lectures. You need improve this course still. 4 weeks are to short.He need more deep and more weeks.
15094,"For an introduction class, I got to create awesome games while learning Unity."
15095,The teacher is awesome! Moved the course!
15096,Awesome experience
15097,"It is a very practical course that would stay into you mind after you finish it, you would not be the same student, you'll be a better one."
15098,"Good structure but a basic course.It´s a good compilation of information about in and Android.I think that some genetic information should be also consider on this course no matter if it´s in or andros.Some video explaining the features like (gas, sir, multi-core processor...) would be good."
15099,His was the very first I enrolled since joining Coursera. It blew me away. Garb has a way to keep your attention.Regarding the content: very good stuff. A lot of thinks I did not know. Please don't skin over the optional interviews. These provide great insight of how very successful people deal with this subject.
15100,"The course is great for music enthusiastic.Has been said, I found myself out of rhythm.Of you a have a beat in your heart, this course is for you."
15101,very good course. nice insight
15102,"The best programming teacher I have ever met, he makes many things which used to be hard for me seem to be interesting. I begin to be a patron lover."
15103,"Moved this course. It provided a wonderful framework for thinking about the social media landscape. I found it had just the right combination of video, sides and articles to keep me engaged. Thank you!"
15104,awesome instructor....very good first course
15105,Great course! Thank you to all excellent teachers and classmates. Wonderful and practical methodology.
15106,Great Course :)
15107,I expected some more coming in the capstone rather than just apply code that has already been written
15108,Great course-really helps to gain insight into all the statistical into when reading the literature. His course has been particularly good in terms of understanding study results and how I can apply research findings to my clinical practice.
15109,I really enjoyed the course and I learned a great deal. The course design is thoughtful and well-carried-out. The illustrations are delightful! The instructor is obviously expert on the topic as well as in teaching and information is delivered very clearly. I will be building on this new knowledge for some time to come!
15110,"Barbara is a fun professor to listen to. The jokes and analogies can be terribly cheese but they are memorable! I wish I had taken this course years before starting university studies. It explains how the brain works to process, learn, and memories information and gives practical tips anyone can implement when trying to learn new material. His is a valuable course that has already enhanced my learning over the 4 weeks."
15111,His course gave me courage to slice into my words fearlessly and cut the deadweight out. I feel like I am a better writer having completed the course and am feeling very confident about my writing future.
15112,Great introductory course on Construction management. I liked the module on technology tends the most.
15113,One of the best courses to begin with machine learning
15114,"His course is great, but I would NOT pay for the specialization."
15115,"The course is well structures, but most of the features in the exercises' pages were not working properly. I tried to access them via both my computer (malbrook) and mobile phone, but in some cases I could not even complete the exercise or check the answers..."
15116,Fabulous course. Great technique and impressive use of moves to illustrate memory principals. I would and will highly recommend this course.
15117,It's awesome. Helpful and re
15118,Very information. A lot of fun. Use ve.com to listen to the music if you take the course.
15119,"Definitely not an introductory course to machine learning, but even if you know nothing about the matter (like me) and have a fairly good understanding of mathematics, or are willing to use your spare time to catch up with linear algebra and calculus topics (again, like myself), you can still enjoy this course very much."
15120,"West Course With West Reaching Method, Wish to have more Courses here."
15121,Excellent tips and tricks for how to improve learning capabilities. Good for all ages.
15122,"Excellent course!!! Choice of mind projects to apply the concepts we learnt was awesome. Excellent course structure, instructor, materials and everything. Moved every part of this course. Thanks for such wonderful course."
15123,"Excellent way to visit/bethink what it is to learn and how best to go about it. While unquestionably a boon to students, as an adult (past middle age), I took away many important and unexpected tips, technique, and perspective. Although I personally had little direct use for the section on Resting, it was still interesting—and I certainly wish I'd known that material when I was a student. One thing I would have liked to have addressed is how to set up and use self-testing to assist with day-to-day, non-student procedures and learning situations. Both faculty members were engaging and inspired confidence."
15124,His class was not useful for me. The professor talked about the idea of data analysis without ever discussing how to actually perform data analysis.
15125,Excellent delivery of content and enjoyed the course very much !!
15126,His Nodule was very interesting. It just have to be updated as things change so fast!
15127,great course really enjoyed it and learned a lot :D 10/10
15128,I found this course less engaging than the previous ones in the specialization. I would have appreciated if the video lessons were rousing more on commenting case studies; in many cases I had the impression that the Professor was simply reading the sides...
15129,Good interesting material but the quires were badly designed and did not test concepts well.
15130,Excellent information and presented in an easy-to-understand format. By only reason for not giving this course five stars was how many examples and details were out of date and not current to today.
15131,"Phenomena course. The assignment are tough, and very insightful, doing a great job of education the course content in a very applied and immediately useful way. The piece on heuristics is especially valuable. I will be applying what I learned here in my work regularly. Very satisfied with this course!"
15132,Vice course! Pushing you to practice and left you act on your own to find accurate results.I thinks that this is the best way to learn if you want to start a career in Data Science
15133,"His course changes the way you think about learning, life and yourself. Everybody who want to learn their whole life should watch it."
15134,"His course is an excellent introduction into the world of game design. Ran Cause's teaching style is both engaging and fun. While the lectures are really short, and there's not really a whole lot of material, I found that I learned well through the doing the projects.By only criticisms are that this course is a little too easy and a little too short. A good game increases it's difficulty as the levels progress. Of you don't increase the difficulty, you take away from the reward. The same can be said about a good course."
15135,"Clear, thorough and interesting course!"
15136,"Must like the first one, really nice layout of the course and good explanations throughout the course book."
15137,Very well structures introductory course.
15138,Good course very helpful for beginners
15139,The best online course I have taken in my life. I like so much the way in what the professor explains every concept of the course. It was a really good experience start with a course like this.
15140,Great course.
15141,I learned key messages and a way of thinking beyond what I knew about sport and sponsorship.Thank you
15142,"Late the music. And that permanent face smile and constant nodding. Those are cheap brainwashing technique which target human cognitive abilities and unconscious to make their words sound more deep and convincing.You often can see such brainwashing tricks in commercial and advertisements which try to elevate some concept or idea but lack any information or facts to back it up. And it is very weird to see same tricks used in this set of lectures, because these ones actually do have a lot of facts and information and arguments behind them.The whole course is basically just blaberring about vegetables. Almost no new or useful information for me."
15143,"Life changing.... Excellent, well thought out, and entertaining. But most of all, this course backs up some intuition ""opinions"" with research that makes it a much more persuasion and powerful message.Thank you!!!"
15144,A very thorough introduction on a unique subject!
15145,"Great lectures, very insightful and very useful."
15146,Very information.
15147,I don't like the idea of writing 800 words essays in English though.
15148,its really wonderful course.Its give direction to thinking
15149,His class does an excellent job explaining the basis without crossing over any relevant into.
15150,Excellent for anyone that need a deep look at case i would recommend it to my friends
15151,Interesting course
15152,"It will be very helpful to me for doing my research work on the very same topic.But all of these courses should be free of cost,just like this one.Thanking you once again !Regards."
15153,I`ll strongly recommended your course for colleagues. It will be fine to translate course in Russian. In last years interest in that field is high due to the fact that Russia created it`s own CFC rules.
15154,Great course
15155,"His course is a short introduction to JavaScript. Their is some useful information, that is very very interesting and easy to understand, but it is too little to understand of."
15156,"Whatever your goal, this course will give you many useful tips and technique to study and learn efficiently."
15157,"I enjoyed studying this course. The video lectures of Or Motto-John very interesting but at times he was too soft spoken; needing extraordinary attention to grasp its content. Also, found the course a bit dry and somewhat difficult. While some notes were provided, there is a need to do a proper study of the subject. A book was promised by the Professor which I look forward to receiving. Actually, for all courses, I feel it will be a great help to all students, particularly those who can not afford costly books, COURSERA offers free or substantially dismounted books on the subject taught.I completed Memory related course UNDERSTANDING MEMORY: Explaining the Psychology of Memory through Bodies 🎥. The professor who presented this course offered his book Memory and Bodies at 30% discount and even provided link with Discount code. Is I liked the course, I tried to purchase this book but I got a reply from MIT Dress that either to discount scheme is over or has not started so they CAN NOT offer it.!!I was very disappointed 😔 that despite COURSERA being such a big and professional body, such gates takes place. You may please address this and then let me know if I can buy at a low price."
15158,Super cool
15159,"Perfect for someone who wants to start learning HTML5 and the entire specialization from scratch.The course is well paced, starts off easy, and seriously takes you step by step into making a web-page."
15160,Or. Chuck is the best with his wonderful sense of humor.
15161,Great course!
15162,Must wish to have some concept check before taking the quit.
15163,Very traumatic and interesting
15164,"One sweet, short course, providing the required answers to anyone interested in learning about Positive Psychology. Enjoyed it!"
15165,Professor speaks very fast
15166,Really nice class. Now I'm clear with some basic things
15167,"Excellent introduction to topic, well presented and very interactive. Quite in-depthAssignments were meaningful and directly related to materials presented. Looking forward to doing more study in this area!"
15168,A good introduction to the Arduino platform. Looking forward to attending the next course.
15169,"I took this whole series in 2015 and I thought they were excellent. I had a programming background, but hadn't programme in about 10 years, and i had no experience with Python. I found the material well presented and the homework interesting and non-trivial. It took me generally about 4-5 hours/week for the lectures and assignment."
15170,A very nice beginner's course for anyone who wants to learn the basis of Chinese language. Very easy and step by step course. Great job!
15171,"Really great course! The professor makes it very easy to learn, especially if you know nothing about web development and you need to learn really quick!"
15172,"Moved it, also loved that it was self paced."
15173,Great way to start with IOT
15174,It's the best!
15175,Great job by the Or. Chuck and the staff
15176,"awesome course,with an awesome instructor!!"
15177,Good course!!. the approach is well-balanced (no superficial and at the same time not too much professional). The quit are done very well.
15178,"Very useful to know different technique for software project/productplanning. Although some of those technique are (in my opinion) pottery relevant in an Agile environment (like work breakdown structures,part or want charts) the course is good to learn how to use those thousand also to ask ourselves whether or not they are actually relevant or useful if we follow the Agile approach."
15179,"Thoroughly enjoyed the course. Andrew put in a lot of effort in the video, exercises and quires. And above all has taught the concepts very well. Thanks a ton!"
15180,"The assignment are well thought out and explain the algorithms step-by-step. The subtitles/transcripts are a disappointment :( . Full of mistakes. Sometimes to the point of being useless or even worse - saying the exact of opposite of what the lecturer says. Since the lecturer sometimes is unclear - this is problematical. Is usual - Graphlab Create sometimes clashes, however there are explanations how to run the assignment using Scikit-Learn."
15181,"a great eye opened for a cloister newby like myself. Although I cannot fully comprehend the rich material and experience shared, the course set me on a good direction on my musical interest discovery"
15182,"Great teacher who can explain concepts in easy to digest manner. Taking some brush-up courses so I played this in the background while I was working, completed a quit and continued the lessons. His class is also great for giving beginners a background of the web and the history of coming and web design. Really fun to listen to."
15183,His course will showed all basic knowledge about expel for you and help you improve your skill if you practice daily.
15184,A good course
15185,"The content is good, but it's lacking articles, important bills etc..; and the quires aren't very hard"
15186,Excellent for beginners. You don't need any experience at all just access to a relatively new computer and the internet.Or. Severance is a great teacher and the Coursera structure of the course is great for low maintenance study.
15187,"Great course, good explanations. Thanks a lot!"
15188,VERY USEFUL and the problem were mind bursting. And I also want to mention about the FORUM. I had never seen any kind of active community anywhere where peoples in the thirst to help others.
15189,"I get lost by the end, but was a great course, now I understand clot of things"
15190,Very good course for those beginning to get their hands dirty on raspberry i
15191,"I liked the course very much. For a foreign speaker, though, I found it particularly challenging. The glances of words are particularly important when dealing with matters of style, and I struggled through the exercises, which I found a bit more ""abstract"" than those in preceding courses of this series. Maybe it was just self-consciousness... In any case, because I encountered this struggle, the course was helpful in making me think about how do I want to pursue my next steps in the process of creative writing -- should I continue in English, or should I try, instead, to do it in my native language? I am sure this is a question that many other students have asked themselves. I shouldn't conclude without saying that I do recommend the course, in any case."
15192,where well detailed and explanations are good. It is very easy and fun going through the course
15193,"Is a high school teacher learning how to process student performance data to drive instruction, I found this and Or. Rev's instructions style incredible helpful!"
15194,"Interesting, but could be improved with further applications."
15195,very clear and well designed course. excellent teacher
15196,It was a bit short but it was very clear and with useful information.
15197,"I have presented many presentations, but I learned quite a lot of things."
15198,"Vice course. Should be taken once you are done with the Computer Science basic courses like data structures, algorithms, etc."
15199,His course helps me to understand the physics concepts . It created a positive impact in my life.
15200,Thank you a lot.I got to learn so much from this course.
15201,"Lawless lectures, easy to understand contents and great senators! I <3 it."
15202,His course is very useful. I learned many useful things and I would like to offer to my customer Google Loud Platform as an alternative Loud for his business.
15203,The Questions in the weekend quires are not that challenging and the lectures are also not concentrated on complicated (Real life scenario). Good for an Introductory course
15204,"It is an excellent and easy way to have knowledge about food and nutrition to apply at home with your kiss. I am grateful to May, she expresses herself very well and she shows she is an expert and a good mother.I super recommend the course."
15205,It is a unique course and I wish that all people heard Professor Philip Zelikows lectures
15206,I wish I knew these technique when I was in school. Very interesting information interesting presented. Easy to follow and remember. Thank you!
15207,The composition and visual elements part of the course was incredible but the Lightroom part could be improved. Going through every feature in Lightroom is not helpful. It's better to focus on teaching key useful technique to achieve desired effects
15208,Excellent Course and fantastic TEACHER!!! Or. Fanning is fantastic!
15209,I loved it! there are no words to describe how much this course has complimented my college education and how has change the idea i had about infectious diseases. Now i wish to continue the study of the Neglected tropical diseases and apply that knowledge in my country and community. Thanks a lot.
15210,"His course reaches how to use spreadsheet to do some prediction modeling. Although no depth in path, but for me, some practical skill and functions are introduced.I just give 4 stars only because the overall content is still kind simple. I though I could have learnt more with this price."
15211,"Great Course, Great instructor"
15212,I like it a lot. I learned a lot although many things already gone but I constantly come back to this.
15213,"Great course although I did struggle through the very last assignment. The first three were relatively ok, considering I'm new at this but they did take me longer than 3 hours to complete. The last one took about 3 days!That being said, if the respect tests weren't being run in de mode, it might have been quicker. I had to move ""ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'test'"" from rails_helper.re to spec_helper.re to get stuff working.Without my ruby on rails hobby, I'd have been lost!"
15214,"Vice course, it gets you started. Maybe they could lower the price for the verified certificate (let's say 10$) since it's just an introduction. Thanks for making me discover the world of Github!"
15215,To actual tools !
15216,In absolutely great course.
15217,Great course; highly information. Good teaching that makes the subject easy to understand.
15218,thank you for everything !
15219,"I learned and reviewed of much from this course. From the rehearsal toolkit to tips with working on intonation and balance to tips on improving conducting, I found this course to be an invaluable professional development opportunity. Strongly recommended for all conductors who work with resembles everywhere, at all levels."
15220,"I really liked your course. One thing that I think would be great is that if you could add questions on the video about the definition of a term, by opposing it with another term. Example: Eight vs Force, or Met Force vs Frictional force."
15221,It is great and very comprehensive.
15222,Truly wonderful course
15223,Chuck is awesome!!!
15224,"Excellent course, highly recommended. Hands-on and really easy to follow. Would love some more background / reading about the applied statistics though (since this is new to me)."
15225,Provides excellent information and encourages new writers to pursue their goals.
15226,Great introduction to know how to access Web Data through XML and JSON objects.
15227,Great course for people who never had prior contact with programming. It helped me preparing for my Master's Degree classes in just a few weeks.
15228,Dijkstra and A star algorithms courses are a bit short
15229,I'd like to thank my professors. It was a great experience!
15230,Very good course.
15231,"The female lecture's speech is so fast and unclear, even though the subject itself is very interesting but I have to leave this class."
15232,Explanations are so logical and understandable that I very often have an impression of knowing what comes next. It is unbelievable how good this course are.
15233,"A very comprehensive, information, and engaging course."
15234,"His course was clear, useful, insightful. Some information in here that everyone should know and use."
15235,I did enjoining this curriculum.
15236,Very Good Course for start-up College students.
15237,Very nice but very primary level is taught.
15238,Very helpful with my position
15239,Extremely helpful for those who love writing for children!
15240,"To put more context here, I think you can expand a little more what are you teaching; especially in the data analysis part."
15241,I have learned a lot from this course
15242,Very good introduction.
15243,"Well designed for beginners to intermediate programme analysis, May much attention on will, and other additional literature."
15244,"It is a very interesting course, on which you can clarify some statements and improve your professional information to be competitive. Thanks a lot! A greetings from Ali, Colombia."
15245,"A very good course, I learn a lot with it"
15246,"I am relatively experienced programme trying to just understand the Android pp development framework and solve some interesting challenges along the way. I feel the course, was very painstaking in terms of code reviewing other people's work.Of I were to break up the time I spent doing the course work, it would be as follows:30 % useful work % taking care of course logistics (code review, writing comments on every line of code just so that people being asked to review my work are happy). Why do we have to do so many code reviews? Not every assignment requires people's coming style to be evacuated. It places an unnecessary time burden on people who are taking this course not as full time student. Its also reducing the total amount of knowledge that is being disseminated. He should be learning about Android for 4 more hours rather than reviewing code for other people for 4 more hours.The thing I found most frustration is that the assignment are trying to force a particular coming style on everyone. Since I am an experienced programme, I understand the importance of coming style, creating functions and all that. However, how I structure my code and how many comments I write are entirely my choice.Now, while I understand that the course material itself does not ask you to structure code one way or another; the review guideline that are being given to some very inexperienced programme, makes them believe that this is the only way things should be done. Its a subtle form of style enforcement which I did not appreciate."
15247,"His course presented a very useful challenge in terms of data analysis. In one of the projects we're given a data-set that doesn't show straight up what to do with it, even with a clear set of instructions. And this is something common in terms of data analysis that everyone eventually faces with. His isn't the kind of difficult in terms of technically, but still took me a couple of times to complete because of the maturity and independence needed to just ""tackle"" the data. I highly recommend it."
15248,"Great course, wonderful experience, easy to understand.I wish to recommend this lecturer and course knowledge to everybody who wish to make conclusion on scientific basis."
15249,"Great course, great materials, great instructor!"
15250,Great course! Very interesting and information.
15251,Basis are very very easy...He can remember in ease...
15252,"Favoring in Genetic and Molecular Biology, I were fortunate enough to meet one of my lecturer who works primarily on Next Generation Sequencing and its downstream analysis. Knowing the importance of how computer science will be in the near future and its power, he urges us to learn about programming and suggests us to extend our smelter to take some programming courses from my university. It was the first time I heard about those words: Sinus, big data, programming languages such as Cava, Python et center.I started searching about some summer courses in my university and also other part time courses from other universities in my countries, but none of them is satisfactory. And then I found course, and decided to register for this course - Programming for Everybody. It is really a great solution, I don't have to extend my smelter, I can learn something so useful to my major yet it is not included in my own course program, and most importantly, I can learn whenever I am free and proceed in my own pace. In this way I find it easier to figure out things which I am confused of and clear them out before I think I am ready for the next.Or. Chuck is indeed one of the most inspiring and encouraging lecturer I have ever met. Clear explanation, and step by step guidance, he clears all doubts in an interesting way. It is his humour that helps me to remember things. Programming can be boring and dull, it is so technical, imagine that you have to follow a certain number of rules to talk to someone, but Or. Chuck makes sense out of it (I still remember the first lecture: while you think you are joking with patron, it says santa error).Is my first programming course, I really learn a lot from Or. Chuck, a lot more than I expected to. I truly appreciate all the efforts made by Or. Chuck and his tears, and also, the tears behind Coursera. Thank you."
15253,"After taking this course, i found it very useful !"
15254,I've struggled mightily in the past with attempts at learning a programming language from the ground up. Or. Severance really did a fantastic job with his lectures. The pace is just right for someone who doesn't just start off as a natural. Looking forward to the next course! Thank you!
15255,"excellent course, all the way from Monterrey, Mexico"
15256,Inspiring and boring.
15257,"I have two degrees and have taken several online courses and been a full-time life-long learner. His is one of the best courses I've ever taken. It seems somewhat new in format, more focused on actual learning than any notion of grades, and by the end, thanks to the wonders of the Internet interface, there was a new, or rather several new features in my inner life that I had more or less painlessly learned. I've recommended this to many people, my children have done it; your course is a true gift."
15258,Amazing fun and useful!
15259,I have tried various online courses before though i couldn't complete anything on time. His course takes the least amount of time and gives you a comprehensive introduction to Python. It has everything which a completely new person to programming needs.
15260,nice teacher well regulated practice.
15261,His is the course where the technically comes into play!!!!
15262,"Really liked the course and love the topic, however the algorithms section was very difficult and could use some more in depth explaining. Without that, I would not quantity it as ""beginner""."
15263,"Love the projects and classes!, but i was expecting more interaction with the teacher due that we found some bags in the content , we were able to solved using the forum, but i was expecting that the teacher step up"
15264,"The content of the course is concurrent with the course title. Sides and reading are spread into weeks classified within topics. Quizzes are qualified, some of them were challenging :) Special thanks to Or. Salzberg and Or. Week. Happy to take to course and stepping into ""Genomic Data Specialization"". I am planning to take following courses."
15265,I highly recommend it!
15266,"I am feeling very honor to complete this on-line course in your organization, i am feeling very thankful to this organization because you helped me financially to complete this course.I will educate my neighbors and friends to do on-line courses in this organization"
15267,"I think the teacher should speak more clearly, he has a strong accent, however, the materials and contents in this lessons are pretty good."
15268,"The course was very interesting, our prof was inspiring. The tests were confusing though, the questions were in a fully order and it was difficult for me to understand their line of thought."
15269,Absolutely brilliant!!!
15270,"Great introduction course. Unfortunately the Protools free version is very weak and limited. After I finished the course there was no motivation to go ahead with so many limitations in the of. I can't even create more than 3 songs :-( Besides that, the ProTools price is too high to buy it for personal use."
15271,Very powerful course!
15272,I love this course and it made me to realize the best investment results
15273,Very creative course!
15274,Learn a lot about how to get start of design or create a product.
15275,Great course.Thanks professor
15276,In excellent course for beginning and advanced writers alike. I can't wait for the next section!
15277,Amazing course. Through my first week now and it's a really good course
15278,some common things need to know for writing professional email
15279,Very detailed evaporation!
15280,The course is really well paced and good contents. However I think it should have a bit more depth contents regarding CSS rules/priorties.
15281,"It was a good information course, but at times it gave me the impression that it was more concerned in showcase the research done at Fund than exploring of the subject at hand."
15282,Great course! I would recommend compressing the audit on the video presentations so it's easier to hear and more consistent in volume level.
15283,All that I needed.
15284,Fantastic first step into Web Rev! Yakov is a talented teacher who is clearly comfortable enough with the course material to teach effectively. I have learned so much in the past 5 weeks and I will definitely be signing up for more courses!
15285,"One of the first Coursera courses and still a solid exemplar.Would stand to be updated with better-produced video (audit levels and clarity in particular) but material is well-organised, interesting and clearly-communicated."
15286,"Wonderful course, especially for non-finance professional!! Very friendly in learning.... Take enough time out to go and deeply understand the terms and concepts explained... His will provide a good head-start!! Cheers Vaidya Than Air!! You are amazing... gutta meet you some time!!"
15287,Excellent introductory course on of. Very well organized and with a clear language.
15288,"nice idea, but too short, shallow and with too few practical examples.Also a review of some software out there would have been handy"
15289,Not learning much and constantly being bombarded with sales tactics. Not impressed.
15290,"A very simplistic overview of necessary skill and helpful writing tips. The video are a bit slow and the instructor stumbled over her words a lot, but the material is great."
15291,"Very well done course, instructor are both definitely great, thanks!"
15292,His was a good time management course. It's fairly basic. But worth taking as a first time
15293,His course gave me the key concepts and technologies for mobile programming
15294,"His course covers a good amount of bayesian statistics. However, the presentation/video starting from week 2 really sucks. They change instructor for difference topics and obviously some instructor are not very good at explaining other than reading the material.The video skipped many medium steps that are actually very crucial for understanding the concepts. And no suggested reading materials at all either. Also the quit are not very well designed either. For example, some quit are much more simpler than the course material, which makes it not helpful at all to understand the course material itself. While some times it is the opposite.The first three courses in this specialization are very good, but somehow this course are way below the quality of the previous ones."
15295,"Professor Chuck is so humorous, I really Enjoyed this course! 100% recommend!"
15296,His course led me through different aspects of photography and provided me with new eyes to look at images.
15297,"Well structures and fun course, great explanations and useful assignment."
15298,Great course
15299,"His course build a quick but engaging overview of machine learning. The structure is more than amazing, the style of teaching is very narrative and very helpful."
15300,Great course to learn about AngularJS. Syllabus is good to provide step by step and deep learning. Examples are good to provide practice practices with steps. Assignment is also a good test for the knowledge learned in each week.
15301,Precise and to the point. Easy to follow and understand.
15302,"really precise , easy to learn i full recommend"
15303,"Good assignment, lectures are a great introduction to Reactive programming but would be nice to have a ""where to go from here"" type of section/lecture."
15304,one of the best!!!
15305,"Superb! After six weeks, I've survived and of course enjoyed the reading and lectures. I've learned a lot in this course. Thank you Professor Baker and team."
15306,Good project enjoyed playing with the Scala.ja
15307,"Great open course. Easy to understand, and I really learned a lot from this course."
15308,Great faculty and course content
15309,Always a pleasure to take courses with Professor Chamovitz. A passionate professor with a real talent for teaching . I highly recommend his courses.
15310,"I absolutely loved the course. I enjoyed the lectures and learned a lot of new skill like , logical thinking , different approaches to problem solving ."
15311,"Excellent course, very clear and full of good ideas."
15312,Managed to complete this in 2 weeks as I have quite a lot of time available. The exercises were fairly simple and easy to understand giving me a good rounding in the basis of patron.
15313,absolutely loved the course and while giving assignment we cannot completely relay on course content.
15314,Very interesting.
15315,"Run course, also practical and useful"
15316,The only reason that it does not get 5 star is due to the fact that the unloading of assignment is really confusing. The code is not unloaded till the solution is right which creates confusion whether the code is wrong or the unload mechanism is wrong
15317,Really provides good basis in understanding your finances
15318,Great course
15319,Great introduction to Web of Framework!
15320,A great course to check the vulneravilities that can have
15321,"Good course, it seemed too easy at times since they provided clot of guides to solving the programming problems but I might be based since I have some programming background. Overall I would recommend for beginners interested in learning cava."
15322,"Very good course which explains Ruby well. Of you have familiarity with any other programming language it shouldn't be too hard.Would, however, use more exercises."
15323,I found this course extremely useful as it helped me better understand design principles which can be put into good use in other visualization tools as well.
15324,It is a very simple course.
15325,His was very well done- high quality and fun!
15326,Totally enjoyed the course and learnt a lot.
15327,I have learned the basis very well along with hands experience
15328,Clearest explanations ever.
15329,"A great introduction to Design, for derbies as well as people with experience. The way the professor introduces us to Design is so gradual that you don't feel as if it's a new area of study. It also sets the tone for the rest of the courses in the Interaction Design Specialisation."
15330,High on opinion and low on scholarship.
15331,Week 1 a little disappointing
15332,"interesting topic, but teaching is not so attractive."
15333,"His course is very insightful, and a great introduction into Quantitative Methods and questionable research practices! The instructor is very insightful, and communicates the information in a highly digestive manner! Thank you!"
15334,thank you!
15335,Very beneficial for me to take the course. Impressed by the professors and what I have learned about my beginning on earth.
15336,By first algorithms course in life :D
15337,Great prime on Microeconomic processes.
15338,Must showing examples of some good projects and their code at most part of the course .Also comparing Peter with Wordpress is wrong and I don't think Peter will reach Wordpress.After all they are different tools for different jobs.
15339,Basic introduction to Python. With my level of understanding I wish I had skipped this and gone straight to the second course in the series...
15340,Great course. Recommendable for many students!
15341,"His was a really great course, i learned so much, and it was really interesting and very well explained. I will be taking any more courses done by Yakov! Really excellent course, thank you so much."
15342,Not of information and hundred of years of history in four weeks it is a great challenge. Only if participants interact more in the forum.Professor is excellent lecturer away from bias
15343,"Very intensive, but amazing course. Thanks to the Lecturer. Great preparation and excellent control of topics."
15344,The course was awesome. Thank you very much Fund University

15346,Moved the instructor and how the course is interactive.
15347,"Great course, I learned a lot, thanks!"
15348,"It has great content but assignment are promotions... Like, really, shame promoted assignment."
15349,Great course and explanations from the Professor!
15350,"It was very useful to understand the first steps in programming and helping me to advance my analytical skill. I would recommend everybody to take this course, especially in today's society where computer programming is key for success."
15351,"very information. the course is very demanding, due to very long lectures it is hard to stay in pace."
15352,His specialization really grows on you :P
15353,"I found the class very easy to follow, yet information and truly helpful."
15354,Terrific course! Very interesting indeed!
15355,His course is helpful to me. I have learnt so many new things.
15356,"Excellent course, highly recommend!"
15357,"Is the first serious encounter with financial engineering I found the course challenging but very rewarding. Very good theory-practice ratio. I would definitely recommend to somebody who is interested in the topic and willing to spend many hours with it. By experiences are based on 4 weeks of completed sessions, so please take it with a grain of salt."
15358,"Awesome course, very well explained!"
15359,"Vice course for an introduction, Excellent"
15360,Very good review of sinus function and disease
15361,General Introduction but it is a very interesting topic!
15362,it's good!
15363,Good introduction to the basis of Web Development process and technologies used.
15364,Simply awesome!
15365,A brilliant course which enables students to understand the fundamentals of Epigenetics. His was my first online course and I am delighted to say that it was a wonderful experience and I gained immense insight into the field of Epigenetics. I'd strongly recommend it to prospective students and academicians.
15366,From Shallow to Deep.A complete course for web development.
15367,Unique and very useful mood. Impossible to get better. Deep going! Special greetings to Or. Ai.
15368,"His was a very interesting course. I come from a design background but have been a web developer for the last two years, and this really introduces the whole of what HCI is and can easily garter your interest in the subject."
15369,"Great class, extremely useful and with enough introductory mathematical concepts to clarify the claims it makes and create theoretical understanding behind the theories. Definitely recommended."
15370,"His type of course I was looking for, which is fulfilled. It will help to explore and polish my creative abilities. Thank you for providing it."
15371,"Very poor instruction and organization of topics, very poor explanation of core concepts. I learned more from reading other sources while taking the class than I did from the lectures."
15372,Great machine learning course! very helpful even for a non-of guy like me!
15373,Probably one of the best courses I ever took.
15374,"A word from old time programme: More basis, fewer complex problems.More stress onto the language construct, control structures, functions, control abstraction ... rather than .. firing out algorithms without having basic understanding how things can be done in Scala."
15375,"His course gave me insight on how simple changes on our learning style, test preparation and even in daily life can have lots of positive impact."
15376,I found the course useful and learnt some basis around software product management
15377,Clear and thought-provoking
15378,"Table Millard is simply an outstanding teacher.Strongly recommended, this is my thirteenth course with Coursera. I've so liked this course the first time, that I'm doing it again. With of Business I've attended ""Critical Perspective on Management"" by Wolf From-Else, outstanding Too."
15379,"Or. Fowler has a very unique talent to explain complex things in a very simple way. I had A grades in mathematics through out school and university, but was never able to give such a practical definition of limits, derivatives and the rest of the foundation ideas. The best course on mathematics out there."
15380,Really applicable course .Great teaching skill.
15381,"Awesome, Codeskulptor is a priceless tool and a great gift to humanity"
15382,"Really well explained, and the instructor is so encouraging - even in her video. You can also tell that she's really passionate about what she does, and is also so clearly a lovely person. You'll definitely walk away feeling more confident to code. I was surprised how much I picked up."
15383,"It is hard to take a course for foreigner who live abroad, but this web site & lecture gave opportunity for everyone including me . It will be very helpful to anyone who have interest in Entrepreneursip"
15384,"Although I studied only weeks, I would like to give feedback because students who are not good at writing should not miss this course."
15385,"His course is fantastic in helping job seekers learn to view themselves and the jobs they are interested in, from the perspective of the hiring authority. Also, will provide skill to be successful on your career path."
15386,Informative course. Would be a little bit faster.
15387,Quite amazing course to help us develop practical understanding about learning!-Anupam
15388,"The course is excellent! It definitely helps writers in taking the story from their minds to paper, using methods to keep the reader's attention."
15389,"Great material and inspiration reflections to increase your wisdom, even if you are highly experienced in the field."
15390,Great course!
15391,Very helpful course. Not to know the technique that were previously unknown to me or which I overlooked as something which will not work.
15392,this course is very easy to know about the patron and its uses for beginners
15393,I would be much better if it would have included the more layman explanation.
15394,His course simply change my learning life!
15395,"His course recall knowledge from other nodules, maybe worth to include more content about those other nodules for participants that are not enrolled in the entire specialization"
15396,"Thanks to Barbara and her colleagues for this wonderful course! it was interesting, helpful, easy to understand and fascinating :-) i enjoyed the images and video within the course, the tests and questions after each video were very helpful to pass the final test and practise all the technique (such as recall, mind tests etc) which were described and suggested at course."
15397,great course - i really like it.Aurelije
15398,"Great course. I really enjoyed going trough all the classes with Emily and Parlor. The case study approach is also very compelling. Moved it and really recommend it to anyone curious about of.Some previous experience in Python is required, which I hadn't, so I had a quick Codeacademy patron course that really worked well."
15399,Absolutely excellent. I enjoyed it so much and learned so much.
15400,It was my first Coursera course and I really enjoyed the structure provided and the whole learning experience. Hope I take the learning from the course and work on improving myself on creating world-class infographics
15401,Great course! Excellent stuff! Highly recommended!
15402,"To much amazing information, the instructor is enthusiastic, and the topics are relevant! Great course!"
15403,Mind of hard to follow. Explanation is
15404,very very helpful . Nicely drafted course .
15405,Very well made and taught me a lot thank you very much
15406,The data structures are basic in this course. But I loved working on the project. I had first hand experience on how to use Cava to code these structures and I think this will help me a lot in the future. The course is well designed and I would recommend it to anybody who wants to learn Basic Data Structures with Cava well.
15407,"It is powerful and enlightening for those who want to go into the field of design of video games, design of characters, and simply story telling."
15408,I loved this course. It's helpful to have focus and direction.
15409,"Excellent Course , Phenomena exposure to Contemporary Debates and theories !"
15410,I learned many new things on this course! It's even gave me new tools to work on some existing projects which is not related to of.
15411,"Very information and entertaining course. I moved to the south 10 years ago from way north and the culture is unique and warm. The people are great storytellers and talk slow, stay long. There is a strong music and writing community and I now understand much better the oral traditions and the roots engrained in the generations of people that grew up here. The strong familiar and community connections are deep and they have a sense of place stronger than I've seen in other parts of the world I've lived. I also see a good life balance, and a lot of joy. A truly rich heritage thrive here, and is not lost, even in these-paced, electronic-laden, modern times."
15412,"Clear, succinct and easy to follow even for a beginner."
15413,Great course with great content. Really enjoy the addition of support material and test cases for the difficult problems.
15414,Very good! I like because I am learning many things.Thanks.
15415,The best elector!
15416,Interesting and innovative
15417,"Exciting course, especially if you use the book and the additional on-line material"
15418,Of you know harmony it's Excellent!if you don't know it's good but difficult!
15419,Very useful and clear. I like the teacher way of explaining. I learned clot in very short time. I highly recommend it
15420,Understandable and useful.
15421,Thank You Pollen for this course which was delivered in the most simplest manner. Easy to understand with quality material. I am glad I enrolled for this course and I have also en
15422,"Thank you for providing such quality courses, simple and great explanation Sick !! :D"
15423,Very nice content and presented so nicely. Must read and highly recommended course for all managers and business analysis.
15424,good class. I did learn a lot.
15425,"War more demanding than previous courses, and thus far more interesting. Backs clear direction compared to previous courses which can be difficult to adjust to, it leaves you to your own devices so to speak and is challenging in that regard."
15426,"Basic and functional, information and good teachers."
15427,His is a brilliant course
15428,"Lectures clear and well-organized. Homework needlessly complicated and with large gap from lecture material. Trader did not give enough into when rejecting submitted work. Fighting last problem at 50% of final week was unpleasant. Posted platform allowed importing re and to.StringIO, but grade rejected them. Posted platform had consistent keener failure on my last solution, but it worked on another system and grade accepted it."
15429,Hard but rewarding experience. Extremely valuable and proved to me that MOOCs are indeed something that can be done successfully!
15430,"Excellent course, very interesting content.A great opportunity to learn about happiness in a different way."
15431,"His is such an insightful course, and provides many fun yet practical exercises on ways to increase your happiness."
15432,Great course !
15433,Good Course
15434,It is a good and interesting course! Thank you for possibility become familiar!
15435,"Great course, instructor was very enthusiastic in his instruction."
15436,Great course!
15437,like everyone said this is awesome course. I just want to mention several things it can improved.1. assignment are too easy such that you can not really learn much through finish it.2. this course contains fair amount of content but don't go much detail into each topic especially the final week class video. it could have contain much more detail about how to implement the code and the mechanism behind it. Unfortunately that part is missing so you can only get a very sketch whole pick and in the end what you learned from that part is just some funny words.
15438,Lessons are very good but the Assignment for the later weeks are way too hard for people with no path or programming experience.
15439,"I simply loved the methodology of this course. Being my first self-paced course with lots of quires and assignment and participation, I thoroughly enjoyed the challenges it posed to learn new skill. I have recommended lots of friends to join this."
15440,"The video are great! Such less path-heavy than the Expel Course in this series, so it was a nice break."
15441,"It was a very enjoyable course up till the end of module three where things went a bit awry; most due to the unexplained withdrawal of the discussion form and the failure of the third party platform to perform correctly at 123D (which left us doing assignment that couldn't be completed with the assigned tools).A big part of the fourth module was about connecting and communicating with the internet via ethernet and wife. That was a bit lost on me, mainly because i didn't really appreciate why i should want to (I can understand many reasons, but none felt very close at hand). I think it would have been more enjoyable with useful examples and practice.K, the course is still worth doing, but i think there is much room for creating a smooth and enjoyable learning process. It felt more like a beta version."
15442,"Very, very interesting!!!"
15443,"Excellent pace and great course material. I like having both the video and sides to refer to, as it allows me to continue studying in environment where I can't play a video. The content turned out to be unexpectedly useful in my work, too."
15444,Easy to start the journey of learning patron.
15445,even a 'standing out' student can be outstanding
15446,"A bit more of enthusiasm should be used by the speakers, otherwise it's a good overview."
15447,thanks a lot
15448,"I came in with my own theories based on my experience only to find there is scientific backing almost everything I have been doing. In example would be dozing off or taking a nap in the middle of a test. Sure, the horror, or, that's ill advised. However, dozing off or taking a nap in the middle of a test allows my brain to go to diffuse mode. When I snap out of it or wake up I suddenly know the answer or how to go about reaching the solution. There has not been a single test I've taken where I took a nap and did not score within the top 5%.Everything I learned here will further augment what I know by experience but did not have scientific research to back up. Everything I learned will help me explain to others what it is I do to learn efficiently and how they can go about doing the same thing (maybe not falling asleep on a test ;P).His was very helpful, and includes loads of resources to read and or watch long after you are done to really solidity those chinks. Would recommend to anyone with the drive to learn deeper and better."
15449,"Very interesting class. The reading were helpful in understanding a deep appreciation for the subjects covered. Still dislike the multiple guess questions at the end of each section, think essays would show mastery of the bigger picture, but understand the constrains of time on the professor. Still, I would recommend this class as a basic introduction to Once"
15450,Excellent course for students who wants to learn about writing academic essays.
15451,In interesting course and great as an introduction to Positive Psychology... a worthwhile course to take!
15452,"After this course, I was motivate, confident, Plan learning effectively easily, Avoid procastination, Manage work tasks well, Real with difficult work/subjects with process approach, Speedup learning, Each my child ways to learn and Understand brain facts. Thank you :-)"
15453,Thank you for giving me excellent information on digital manufacturing. It is very helpful course for me. Thank you The State University of New Work and Coursera.
15454,The course has covered all the topics related to Hairy & Arm Management. Thanks a lot to the Professors for sharing their
15455,Its a solid cava class that has almost 0 andros learning. Of you are expecting any kind of Android related learning. you will get none this is 100% a cava class that just runs in the andros environment.
15456,"I had used Bootstrap out of necessity in the past, picking up bits here and there. His course was excellent for filling in the gaps and giving a proper overview of Bootstrap and how it can (and should) be used for front-end development."
15457,"Sucks....The audit quality sucks, the video quality is also miserable. The topic is good though."
15458,"AWESOME COURSE!!! Professor Door is both a high profile researcher, a very gifted teacher and a nice and fun person. He conveys a lot of difficult ideas in a very organized and very clear way, with lots of examples and occasions to practice given along the way. His enthusiasm for genetic and evolution is contagious! I have just one comment. It's a pity that he didn't include in the material a list of reading accessible to someone who has taken this course."
15459,Too much introduction
15460,Excellent started course. Or.Charles gives clear explanations and helps get a grasp of the fundamental concepts with the utmost ease. A must-do !! By the way: of'S FUN.
15461,"Even as a mathematician I found it super useful to participate this class. I have learned similar material in an undergrad course, but I forgot most of it. In fact this course is so much better than the undergrad course I took, because quires and the project help me to learn the material by practical exercises. I am really thankful for the Data Science team for this course and all the Data Science Specialization!"
15462,"too short and not very helpful for me, I was missing more details."
15463,"His course was too mess. I spent 75% of my time to get the examples to work. It would have been better if after each module all the .is and .html files would be given in total, not just the shippers."
15464,"His course is very complete, the reading are understandable and also the classes. It does require some more time comparing to other courses, but it's definitely worth it. I've learned so much i can't even believe it.The only thing i'd maybe change is in one of the nodules (week 5) it's kind of confusing how to submit the results of a review of some essays. that's it."
15465,Very interesting course
15466,It is perfect if you want to know something about sociology!
15467,"amazing course a must take one, changed my life"
15468,"The content, although very basic, is interesting, and some of the teacher's insight do stimulate discussion, but the video quality is low, with non watching sides, etc."
15469,"Kills acquired when finishing this first course are very useful and applicable. However, lectures and assignment are almost unrelated. His course is nothing for people who are new to patron."
15470,"Great course. Thank you. The information was very comprehensive, and thorough, and very professionally presented. Very enjoyable and I learned a lot."
15471,"Vice and tough course. Take sure to plan ahead for the homework if you expect to complete all of the assignment above and beyond what is required. After finishing the course I switched my session to the next one so that I would be able to complete all the extra assignment. It can be tough judging this class if you work full time, and have other projects outside of work that demand your time."
15472,Good course and effective learning experience .
15473,"The course is excellent, it provides the necessary foundation to understand financial markets which is the starting point for all investors. Some the English enunciation of the instructor is a bit difficult to understand but I got what I needed. Well done."
15474,Very good! I enjoy this course and recommend it to every one interested in data learning and programming learner.
15475,I love it!
15476,One of the best courses that I have taken on Coursera. Prof Andrew is simply amazing at building concepts from the ground up and then correcting those with the more complex concepts involved in learning about of. It's one of the most relevant pieces of course material to today's technology scene and I really liked the focus on actionable material vs.other courses that focus mostly on the theoretical aspect of complex subjects. It was a pleasure learning this course and I will look forward to more such courses on of and associated topics.
15477,"Great Material, and superb style of presentation. The examples are good, and the explanation is very detailed. Really appreciate the effort towards the material creation and presentation."
15478,Great content and exercises which facilitated understanding of very complex concepts.
15479,His course very useful
15480,"The perfect introduction to machine learning technique. Lectures are almost always very clear, well-structures and sometimes even genuinely thought provoking. Andrew G is an extraordinary teacher.The lecture course doesn't require a strong background in mathematics or computer science. With a reasonable effort it can give you really a lot."
15481,"excellent course, and very useful skill learned"
15482,Great class all around!
15483,Great course!!
15484,A comprehensive introduction to process mining!
15485,"Great course , great teaching style and content :)Moved the course."
15486,very useful course
15487,very nice course especially week 1 is amazing
15488,Very Good Sides for Chemistry!
15489,"A good course. However, I would expect more coherence between the different nodules discussed. In its current structure, the course represents a glance at an arbitrary selection of several topics (unrelated to e, existing in today's philosophy, rather than a coherent introduction into the broad discipline of philosophy. However, this may be just a matter of approach - this approach is also perfectly valid."
15490,"I am a chemist/biologist without any formal computational training or strong background in mathematics. His course has helped me grasp concepts around machine learning which I feel are increasingly important in the field of computational biology and given me the confidence to pursue projects in machine learning. I believe this will be an important skill for my going career and am very thankful for the material and the opportunity to grow outside of my career.Thank you Andrew G, course mode and, Coursera!"
15491,"Good brain trainer. A bit overloaded by path-theory examples, but obviously it's what could be expected for general introduction to any programming learning. His course well introduces basis for Functional Programming and will be good not only for Scala developer. Thank you to Martin and other creator."
15492,To simple with little examples
15493,"awesome tool, reaches you how to think like a data scientist"
15494,I really enjoyed this course.The challenging exam helped me learn how to use R to read and explore Data.
15495,"Fantastic course with fantastic materials, i love it."
15496,Excellent Course and excellent teacher!
15497,"Great course, great teaching.Of more stuff is introduced, that would be even better."
15498,Extremely well put together with excellent projects. There are minor errors that are corrected in the course wiki.... you just need to pay attention.
15499,one of the best English courses
15500,Really good course
15501,"His course is really important to me because it is the first one I'm taking. To, the choice was just right as it made me literally addicted to Coursera. Thank a lot for this course to Coursera and Pale University! Prof. Shapiro is a great lecturer. Thumbs up"
15502,Great course for first level into the subject. Hope it will be offered in English next time.
15503,"Great course, well worth taking since Even is an integral part of the Google Digital Analytics Team."
15504,"I enjoyed the course to review my CSS/HTML skill and get started on JavaScript. I would recommend this course if you have some preliminary experience. Of you are completely new to these materials it might be worth doing an introductory course first, as this course is fast-paced and for a beginners many details might be missing."
15505,Gets you all set up! Essential if you're new to R
15506,Excellent! THANK YOU! You are doing a service to the community. Not everyone can study in Stanford but you are making that possible through this online offering at no cost and surely tapping into talents which would have been unnoticed otherwise.
15507,I really enjoyed this course. I liked the forced research into micro-controller and embedded systems.I would however like to stress that the use of peer reviewed assignment slow the pace of the class down greatly. People sometimes like to progress a lot faster. Difficult to do when waiting for others.
15508,Great
15509,Comprehensive cover of the basis.
15510,Very Good.
15511,"Or. Men is great at teaching, and the lectures are not hard to follow. The recommended e-book is almost a transcribe of the lectures' examples, and I really recommend getting it (I got it on print, as I like to make innovations while following the video).That being said, the Programming Assignment are extremely difficult for anyone with no programming background. The Assignment do not require just what is being taught, and demands a lot of goose and stick overflow research in order to solve the problems. Of you are doing other Coursera courses and/or working at the same time, I recommend you invest time in this and do not let the assignment for the weekend."
15512,"A very comprehensive overview of lung and esophageal cancer, from risk factors, to diagnosis, staying, surgery, palliative care, psychological support and pain management. I thoroughly enjoyed participating in this excellency presented course."
15513,Neatly explained. To prerequisite needed. Very good course.
15514,Great course.
15515,"To far the course appears to be very good, but the request for an upgrade after every video becomes more and more annoying as the number multiplied"
15516,"His is a bait and switch. You must purchase the course even though parts are free, it's really not."
15517,"Excellent program, I learned a lot to complement my knowledge of fraud examiner. I will recommend it to any one interested in Forensic accounting and Fraud."
15518,"I really enjoyed this course. It threw me, at first, that the whole course was only lectures -- no video or reading -- but so much of this course will be applicable to teaching biology that it's useful no matter what. I also had a small problem with verifying quires on my phone."
15519,West course in the entire specialization so far.
15520,"It was a clear explanation to the statistical, and the examples are"
15521,learned a lot! than
15522,i love this program...it has developed me more on how to approach a subject or course..buds to Or. Barbara Valley...u are a good teacher
15523,"His course is very useful and interesting, but the materials of week 2 & 4 is enough for their quits."
15524,That a great class! His was one of the most pleasurable experiences learning something that is both challenging and highly applicable.The effort that was put it into making this class such a success is apparent and well appreciated. Well done!
15525,Enjoyed the class a lot. The explanations were very clear and pitched well to students who were new to web programming in general. The advice was also very useful to new students starting out. Had a great time taking this course!
15526,this course will enhance and give knowledge to everyone
15527,Great course!
15528,"Lovely course, lovely teacher and lovely materials."
15529,"I would like to say ""thank you"" Prof. G and team! You've done an excellent job by this course and it was a great pleasure to learn with you."
15530,"Easy to follow. Right be too easy for some people with experience in data analysis. However, the instructor also talk about some framework and insight from their experience which could be helpful for even those who have experience."
15531,His Course is very good.
15532,"EXCELLENT!!!MANY MANY HEARTIEST CONGRATULATIONS AND WARM REGARDS of Or. Have Dixon, Or. Austin Shewell, Jessica Into, AND OTHERS! Or. Have Dixon MADE THIS WHOLE TESOL (CAPSTONE-1 & 2) COURSE SIMPLY VERY VERY INTERESTING & WORTHY! of'S SIMPLY INCREDIBLE! of SPECIAL GOOD WISHES & REGARDS of THIS VERY SPECIAL PERSON! THANK YOU, ALL!!!"
15533,Great course! You will learn much on Arduino projects and Arduino Fields.His course ears my highest recommendations and is ideal for someone who wants to learn more on of.
15534,It seems the teacher was under the influence of psychological drugs. He lacked the qualities of humans.
15535,"Clear explanations,exercises are very detailed and contain sufficient complexity to make them useful."
15536,Amazing course with amazing teachers .North every penny .
15537,"Great course, Andrew G does a good job at easing you into this complex subject, particularly for somebody like myself without much baths background. Looking at other video courses on the subject, I think more interactive visualisations could've been a great help, for example to gain some intuition about polynomials with different input parameter. Drawing lines on screen works, but I've had many revelation when working with the interactive tools linked from the wiki content. In some course exercises, the tutor and lecturer disagreed on the approach (e.g. vectorised vs. operative), so the video/PDFs were inconsistent with discussions/tutorials - a bit confusing."
15538,"Terrific course, i got here after starting the Data Science specialization on John Hopkins un on Coursera, but there bit on statistics is awful, a waste of time.I decided to give Course another shot and definitely not regretting it, this course really go over the basis clearly and make sure to make enough exercise to visit that clearly explain the fundamentals.I was happy as getting to the final assignment i found myself doing quite an advance analysis and inference that i notice i really understood the topics on the course."
15539,A Complete course to learn from zero!!!
15540,The course really helped me to organize my weeks and months better. I think that what I liked the most it that it was very brief but everything was explained and the video lectures didn´t take more thank 20 minutes a week.
15541,I really like the challenges. And the course is too interesting. The Black teacher (Sorry I don't have his name in mind right now) show how science can support empire thoughts : Everyone can start a business !!! To run people.
15542,"Great course with good case studies and clearcut goals - learn knit, markdown, and a little history of literate programming languages. The importance of making Reproducible Research is ineffable. But, reproducible research won't do anything if the analysis is wrong- this is covered in data pipeline lectures in week 3."
15543,A very good course that introduces you to a lot of photography related concepts and terms. The assignment are very hands on and fun to do. The course also gives you great printers for choosing a new camera!
15544,Excellent industry knowledge coupled with engaging video tutorials. Great intermediate course to further your knowledge on the way traditional hotel departments have developed into the intertwined entitles we see today.
15545,"Great courses -- the only thing I would improve if possible, would be more incremental steps leading up to assignment. Will was a lifesaver for this, but I would love more Will exercises to get the hang of each topic."
15546,Great course! I enjoyed it very much and learned a ton. Highly recommended.
15547,"I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot about the energy industry and issues facing the of based on energy resources. I have taken another course that involved writing reports, rather than just quires. I think that a more in-depth assessment for the course might improve it slightly."
15548,"The course is really awesome and very much help full, as a student I can say every students that they want to go to universities they should join to this nice course which is provided by the course the best plat form for education.Thank you for providing such a help full course."
15549,"His was a really interesting and useful course! The instructor was good at explaining the concepts. The assignment were useful; Active was a good choice and a language i had never used before. Some of the early lesson video had audit problems, most could probably be solved with an automatic volume normalized. Having a slightly slower pace option without twitching sections would have been nice. Looking forward to doing another related course!"
15550,"congratulation, It takes a score of 100%, not handed me the certificate, I request deliver me to prove my study"
15551,"fun,practical and fulfilling,thank you so much."
15552,Great Nodule. Enjoyed thoroughly.
15553,Very helpful course for beginners who have no previous knowledge of computer programming! Definitely recommended to all who want to challenge themselves with something completely new!
15554,Great lecturer and very interesting course!
15555,His class's R markdown material taught me to efficiently convey and market data analysis to non-specialists of data. It was immediately valuable to my career.
15556,I love this course. The instructor explains the topics very well and it's well organized!
15557,Great Course !!!
15558,Impressive. Great Idea and professionalism. In excellent foundation of starting student.
15559,"Topic is very interesting, however I think that there should be a strong way to share more information from the University to the participants such as reading, more video and more forms to create a more dynamic and even more interesting environment."
15560,Learned a lot!
15561,His is ok and I enjoyed the humour and feeble running gas in the lectures.But it doesn't justify the rip-off pricking at all.
15562,Really concise overview on ruby and rails! I am so grateful for this course!!
15563,I recommend for who wants to get to know a bit more about Global Health and also keep in mind the challenges and the future solutions.
15564,It is an excellent course. I am a commerce glad without baths. i find it too good course. It is helping me a lot to understand calculus.
15565,well structures and useful course
15566,"Well, it'll be good if you set the expectation that you're learning information theory and binary classification in this course, with Expel being the tool by which you use to learn those concepts.However, do not expect this course to be entirely about Expel, it is not.With the right expectation, this is a great course!"
15567,Good for interpersonal Development skill. The reaches seems very nice and experienced
15568,"Excellent course. 100 Joints.A wide and deep overview in the fascinating world of machine learning, reached by a man who knows exactly what he is doing."
15569,"The course was pretty easy to learn, but the assignment were challenging, which is the best combination of theory and practice in my opinion. Although I didn't have enough time to dive into discussions and get to know with the community, I'd recommend this course to anyone who's making his first steps in creative writing. It will teach you how to limit yourself in your writing, be consider and yet create stories that are both entertaining and thought provoking."
15570,"Great course,great instructor. It could benefit from a discussion board."
15571,"By serves being in the middle of the financial crisis and working for a sovereign financial institution without having a major stake on the line is like being at war without a license to kill or die for.I think both T. Either and A Trick gave us a very realistic and honest picture of the current affairs of the Global Economic Crisis from 2007 and on wards.Considering Geithners special position as Secretary of the Treasury at the time it is therefore very firsthand and insightful information however there is always the risk of contamination from what was done as opposed to what could have been done.Great Course - a must for economists!West – Henri Jerking, Data Scientist and Economist"
15572,Quite information for beginners.
15573,"The professor's view of Plato is unique and interesting. I would not recommend this as a first look at the Dialogue, however. Also, it was difficult to see how the lectures connected to the relit of the course, to teach ""reason and persuasion"", in Plato's view. The course was more of a ""modern take on ancient questions""."
15574,Enjoyable and helpful!
15575,Such an interesting topic with really well informed teachers.
15576,good course
15577,"It is a helpful , applicable Course . I enjoy it and i finished it in 2 days, Because I was excited to continue ."
15578,His is a very good course I swear. Very practical and good explanations from the teacher. Thank you
15579,I really enjoyed studying the course and want to learn more about patron! Thanks a lot to the professor and classmates!
15580,"great into to machine learning, learned a lot"
15581,Very good starting point to learn Python!
15582,nice course for anybody interested in programming
15583,"Excellent into course ! I would've liked more focus on hands-on exercises, but it provided a great overview and foundation."
15584,Good introduction
15585,"Overall I think this is a great course and really helpful. However, I had an unpleasant experience on the last week. There is an assignment that asks you to create a single contrast composition of 2 shapes. It says ""shapes"" and still people are not sure if they can use more count of those shapes. I chose to use 2 shapes, but multiple counts and some people that thought this is not only 2 shapes, but 2 counts as well, chose to grade my work with the lowest rating due to unfulfilled assignment. I think this is Coursera`s fault to begin with. They should word their requirements properly so it does not create confusion. Now, we are left to the good will of a classmate to judge our work and people are not even sure what the assignment asks of us exactly."
15586,"I would advise anyone doing this specialization, to take the Cava for Android first, then do the Engineering Maintainable Android apes, as its only in the Engineering Maintainable Android apes that there is an optional coursework to create and test a very simple pp for the first time. All the other MOOCs optional courseworks start from very complex pre-existing pp examples. I was able to complete these courseworks but I didn really understand all the surrounding code that did a lot of important of stuff, or the knit test. Its good to be forced to make a simple pp and get used to knit from day 1. I did not take this route, but I wish I had."
15587,Great course for inspiration for further exploration.
15588,"Vice course, nice teacher!"
15589,"Helpful for me, an adult learner, to get back into the practice of studying."
15590,"Good overview, but some of the content is just quickly mentioned and not put into practice. Give more room to use in examples, create action, tell stories. Some of the lectures were just reading down the notes her already see in front of us and were not finishing their sentences in an engaging way (sometimes they made comments in a very low tone) . Some of the sounds are not good quality (mon - just on one ear)"
15591,His is an outstanding course! It's challenging and really well taught.
15592,i like this course... it is a very interesting
15593,"The course materials such as the lecture video, sides , assignment and of helped me to grasp and implement the basis of Python very well. I have recommended this course to my colleagues who are interested in learning Python"
15594,"Amazing Course, made me understand Angular in an easy way. It gave me a good quick start. Oats of to the teacher for all the hard work."
15595,"Very concise lectures, but sometimes the content of the video does not fully explain the topics that are covered on the quires."
15596,it is really amazing how our brain works and how we supply the knowledge to our daily study and life
15597,"Amazing experience! I had study finance and banking all my life during of, MBA, and management consulting and by far the perspective of Merry Mehrling is truly inspiration. His course is a must for every professional."
15598,"The course was very useful, and interesting as well. :) I always like when people talk about what's there to discover and work out yet, not only what we already know."
15599,I was especially encouraged by my progress in this course
15600,"Very good course, in terms of learning tools and preparation for the specialization"
15601,"His is a nice short course, but it could be arranged more efficiently. It is a very important cause."
15602,His is a great introductory course (and it's even useful if you've already studied these topics but need a bit of reminding). ;)
15603,Excellent insight and curriculum delivery!
15604,"I only did week one of the course and quit for the following reasons:Presentation of the content is too fast and provides little information among lots of noise. Most of what's said is genetic keywords assembled in sentences that don't make much sense, or implies ""common sense"" evidences barely illustrated with vague figures and no sources to support them. It makes everything hard to follow for beginners and convincing for more advanced students.In top of that, I feel offended by the mysogynist examples and the underlying contradictory assumptions that designer outside of agile are basically incompetent while saying at the same time that they will just use methods they already know anyway."
15605,"It gave me a good course overview, now I know what to wait for from the specialization."
15606,"His is a fantastic and comprehensive course. Of I had to it-pick, it would be questioning the particular coverage placed upon China in the sub-topic of ""Now did Modernity evolve after the Industrial Revolution?"" and the seemingly critical view taken towards its modernisation.One point in particular was ""He've achieved a war over nature. There we've done it, there's a cost to ourselves, as the intensifying flooding in Shanghai often illustrates. Early in October 2013, Shanghai was hit by two typhosus which came together and saturated Shanghai with the heaviest rainfall ever recorded."" I'm not a Chinese citizen, but it sounded to me like China received her due comeuppance, which I felt was a little uncalled for.While China's trade opening may be significant in world trade, I'm not sure if the particular in-depth coverage on China in relevance to the question, is a stretch."
15607,"I have been using web technologies for quite some time now and I was one of those people who are writing html/iss/is without really understanding what is going on behind the scenes. The course helped me fill in the gaps in my knowledge.The lectures go at a nice pace and explain as much as possible without getting tedious. They are very practical, no dry theory.The assignment don't require huge efforts.Well done!"
15608,The instructor's lecture sounded too robotic and I feel like he didn't make any effort to explain some of the principles or simplify the course to the audience. It feels like he just copied concepts and passed them into the lecture and then read them quick.
15609,"His was an outstanding introduction to teaching English, but as a practicing teacher of a different subject, I found it helpful for teaching any subject. I strongly recommend this course!"
15610,"I really like it. The course was a bit to short, but still I managed to learn few new things. It was definitely interesting plus interviews with well know people is a huge plus. Deep up a good work!!!"
15611,"His course is very useful cause it covers the basis and so much deeper and very well explained. I just found a big leap between nodules 3 and 4, the difficulty increases!"
15612,It would be better if the instructor cared to respond to queried.
15613,Not according what I expected
15614,"Thomas Merry was a visionary, illumination our context and leading the way forward to give hope to our generation and those to come. His is a call to action from the future. The vision of a flourishing Earth community, where humans enhance and nurtured, brings me great hope and purpose. That a gift."
15615,Thank you for the excellent training.
15616,"The guy who explains talk like ""I do not want to do this"" I think a Project manager should have the power of influence."
15617,His is awesome learning experience.
15618,clear and effective
15619,Good course about algorithms.
15620,"Interesting, the information is very basic so if you already have some knowledge in nutrition it may be a little bit to simple. That's the only reason I put a 4 stars and not a 5, is a great introduction to nutrition."
15621,"The course is very useful as a good overview to programming with Python and a quick look at some of the basic functions. Is a good introduction for the later Python courses in the series. The first few lectures are a very general introduction to programming as a concept rather than Python specifically so can be skilled over if you're not completely new to the concept. Overall, a good introduction to the topic."
15622,Great way to start learning how to code :)
15623,Excellent course ! It's been ten years I didn't take any course (actually since I'm an engineer) and I've never been so happy to watch a course or to do an exercise. Andrew G is an excellent teacher and he knows how to detail complex problem with simple words. I definitely recommend this course. It's an excellent introduction to machine learning.
15624,"Great course! Amazing teachers, a lot of information and very interesting interviews."
15625,"His is a wonderful and friendly course that, at any moment, seems relatively easy yet conveys a smart and sensible pedagogy to help students acquire a language. Each week's coursework lays out a simple metaphor, yet that chain of ideas leads to some very sensible ideas like how one shouldn't feed English to students the way one needs corn to geese for path, but, rather, that students should be motivate to teach themselves by immersing themselves in language communities. To this course was a lot of fun, yet in only a few weeks I've learned more about pedagogy than I did on a five-year English-teaching trip around the world."
15626,Great introduction to Chinese basis. I'm waiting for the next curses! :)
15627,"Great course! Andrew is a fantastic teacher, and the weekly assignment are the perfect challenge for those who prefer a hands-on style of learning."
15628,"awesome, course but don't use green colour for chart it makes difficult to look"
15629,Vice advice that could be crucial for some persons. The course is still a bit short making it frustration because 50% of what was taught I already knew.
15630,thank to so my. i learned a lot of new and exciting things.
15631,"Moved this class. Perfect level of difficulty for me, engaging video, and the material provides the right amount of into to get the assignment done without being too obvious. Or. Chuck is really entertaining :) I am seeing more and more ways that I can apply this to my work and look forward to the continuing classes."
15632,very interesting course for beginning programme!
15633,"Lecturer is downright boring and not engaging.Would had used more real-world companies as examples for teaching, including pictures, but it's the same bland sides again and again."
15634,Very helpful course
15635,Thank you very much.
15636,In inspiring course.I've learned a lot by experimenting. It would be better if there's a enter for us.
15637,"Great course, excellent introduction to Graphics Design for me as a developer and a non-designer."
15638,I'm enjoying this practical course
15639,"A great introductory level course to Competitive Strategy. Professor Kretschmer does an excellent job of engaging the audience, keeping the content simultaneously light and yet challenging. The course highlight the basic premises of how best to enter a market and how to keep a competitor out of the market. You will also find ways to strategically price products for profitability based on the expected, logical reaction from your competitors. Thank you Professor Kretschmer for a great course."
15640,Beer review on this specific course is at times not the best choice
15641,"Very interesting course. I would like programming assignment to be mandatory, not optional. Or at least there should be a way to get some information that the assignment is passed on Coursera page."
15642,Great instructor. Complex topics were taught in an easy-to-follow manner.
15643,detailed introduction but I feel sometimes the topic can be a little bit deeper.
15644,"Course is good and very interesting, but extremely little interaction takes place in forms, especially not at all from the operators."
15645,"Excellent course, loved the material!"
15646,Simple direct to the point and gives amazing information
15647,"Thanks for teaching Python in easy way, I have learnt a lot for this course. Deep learning!!!"
15648,"Course deals with many interesting theories about motivation, leadership, tearworn and culture. However, it lacks practical examples and case studies (there is only one in the last week). I liked the required reading material, but I did not find video very engaging."
15649,"The course content is perfect, however the rating system is kind of disappointing. First, the rating is very subjective, thus I might pay great efforts to my submission but get a grade below my expectation. Second, sometimes I can be busy on weekend thus I want to finish the peer review earlier on Friday, however, there might often be not enough submission to be reviewed, thus I am very pressure to do this with a exhausted mind and body in the evening on Sundays. Would I just pass if there's no other submission to review?"
15650,Excellent course. Great teacher !!!
15651,"His course was fantastic. I am no stranger to online learning and executive education, and this is one of the most well put together courses that I have been lucky enough to experience. The professor, Uric Rindfleisch is a great teacher who knows his topics, and he is fun and easy to understand. The class is set up well, and it is a great introduction to students seeking to learn about digital marketing. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in digital marketing. Thanks Uric for the great job."
15652,His course was very helpful. The webster and plug-in mentioned for analyzing a site's SEO are more than valuable.
15653,Interesting and education course. Recommended for every management staff.
15654,May too expensive for its contents
15655,Excellent course. Well paced and very well explained. All the teachers have the ability to explain complex things in a simple way that is easy for a philosophy beginner to understand. Highly recommended.
15656,C
15657,"I really enjoyed this course! I have had an interest in Buddhist ideas, particularly meditation, but come from a very scientific midst and want to see all ideas supported by experiments and empirical evidence. His course does a great job connecting results from psychology and neuroscience that aren't specifically about testing Buddhist philosophy and explaining how they support these ideas."
15658,The first Coursera course that makes me want to be a better parent for my son!
15659,His course is incredible.
15660,Vice course. Helped me learn a lot.
15661,Too much refuse of old material (assignment as well as lectures).
15662,"I am impressed and exceptionally satisfied passing the course. Very useful, presents range of theories and points of view, combined with real life cases and in-depth explanations. Thank you!"
15663,"Very Informative, and educational. I most certainly recommend!"
15664,It is very useful for me.
15665,Really interesting course. I enjoy the lectures because they are well explained and full of important material. I recommended to anyone that have some knowledge or basic knowledge about infrastructure.
15666,"Very straight-forward and easy to understand, especially for those without coming experience."
15667,I really learned a lot and gave me tips on how to be a better learner in all aspects not just academic.I highly recommended!
15668,"some weeks are really easy and understandable, but some which consist of x number of lessons are far more challengable, moreover the topic during such weeks may be also way more harder. i would really consider somehow redistribute tasks/lessons to make all weeks of a similar level of understandability and possessing the same number of video lessons.overall it's a really great course though"
15669,Exceptionally well taught and amazing content! I can only recommend everyone takes this course :-)
15670,Would be more clear about how to calculate period and lately.
15671,Awesome course and awesome language. It was very though but totally double course.
15672,it is the greatest course that i have ever taken in my whole life. with its practised it reaches an individual to be happy and be happy for all of his/her life time.
15673,"Moved this course! Or. Chuck makes it fun by adding the bonus material - office hours video as well as the fantastic interviews with all the computing great whose work we've used so far but haven't had any chance to interact. The course itself is great at explaining tricky topics including web architecture involving drawers, search engines, data wrangling code etc. without turning off new earners.The sal/ rooms part cases earners into using DRI with without the actual declarations rather insects and updated, but this is so vital a concept for database that there could possibly be some bonus video explaining this with a little bit more rigor (as quite does support foreign key references). Nevertheless a great course keeping in mind that it primarily deals with programming in patron rather than do code."
15674,"Or Chuck makes the dancing look less dancing. Subjects covered include exploration of API, rounding in data scraping etiquette, basic data modeling economical database normalization, continuation of Google API encoding, use of Python for scraping and cleaning data. The course assumption is that if you made it this far, you can handle a speedily pace of content delivery. The discussion forms are more valuable too, as one learns what libraries and functions differ between Python 2.7.x and Python 3.x."
15675,good course every beginner should do it to get basic knowledge of pythonunlike other tutorials it give a problem statement and move forward only when it is completed
15676,It was a good course so information and simple to understand
15677,I enjoyed the course and gather much more information related to history and current terms of SEO. Indeed it is good course overall.
15678,"His course is great, help me so much with learning MATLAB."
15679,"Excellent course and provides good confidence to explore. I was very new to of, but after attending the course feeling confident. Thanks Prof Andrew and course for providing all details thoroughly, its really helped me lot."
15680,Great course! I learned so much and the difficulty is really well grade.
15681,"A good place to start of your entry to Data Science. You get to know what data science is, what are the tools used and get an idea of what can be done and cannot be done. The course even walks you through installation of r, studio, and git. It introduces version control system using Github too."
15682,Very Good course. The teacher is very clear and enthusiastic.
15683,Vice curse. Recommended 100%
15684,Very accessible!
15685,great but complicated assignment
15686,"Very information. Would be interested to see the correct way to complete many of the assignment, as I'm sure there are more elegant ways to complete them than I used"
15687,Course was awesome but shudder's programming was missing
15688,Very disappointed with this final course. Little to no support. Discussion Forum provides some level of help but you are basically on your own.Very challenging to come up to speed with Natural Language Processing technique if you have never taken any class about it.By recommendation to JHU and Coursera is to add a separate course for NLP where you cover all the basis and then have the Capstone.
15689,It was so helpful. Thanks so much.
15690,Great Course.
15691,"Great course and introduction to Peter.is The course material is very complete, and the topics cover are all what you need to know about method from start to simple application up and running. Very chapter is well explained and easy to follow. I widely recommend this course for getting basic knowledge of Peter and its features."
15692,"The course was excellent. Each topic that is introduced is explored deeply while real life tested examples are simultaneously provided. It reaches you a lot of strategics on how you can go about your own business and how ideas can be converted into real life models. It also comprehensive goes into a lot of strategics while explaining how they work. A lot of hypothetical situations are also provided which help you to think in those lines and be able to tackle situation. From the most effective way of brainstorming to how to collect survey data effectively. His course has it all. I would like to thank all the professors that were involved in the making of the course, its taught me a great lot and I can't wait to progress through the other courses. Even though I'm only 16 years old, this courses offers things for everyone. Even if you aren't an entrepreneur, its a great course to be part of!"
15693,Good content as an introduction to Machine learning!
15694,"His course is very hands-on and detailed, unlike other similar ones I've taken. Prof. A does and excellent job combining the ""soft"" (design, branding, communication, etc.) and ""hard"" skill (number crunching, formula, etc.). You will learn how to back-up your arguments with figures and analyze how your actions impact KIPs in your company"
15695,Very basic introduction to typography. The material a bit more simplistic than I had hoped.
15696,Thanks for building me through Getting Started with Python.
15697,"The step where traditional biology end, bioinformatics starts...There is no doubt in that."
15698,"Phenomena course content delivered in fun, easily digestive chinks. I loved the references to the latest neuroscience and the stories of hard work and perseverance that led to success, like Santiago Among y Canal. The bonus/extra reading was really helpful and entertaining as well (especially about writing and languages).It was a real pleasure to have taken this course, my first with Coursera. I wish I'd known this stuff 15 years ago when I was in university... I fell into the trap of re-reading as a learning technique.I'm telling everyone I know about Learning Now to Learn, particularly those who are currently in university."
15699,"I am really enjoying the course. It is really simple, information and helpful."
15700,Wonderful lesson which should be promoted in all the universities or the fresh one who just start his career..
15701,"His one starts out pretty slow, in fact I had a hard time getting myself excited about working through the material unlike the of specialization. However, it does get better at the end. Not sure I'm sold on this specialization yet, but we will see after the next course. I think overall from Coursera I'd like to see more interaction and grade programming exercises in between video to really hammer the concepts home."
15702,Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us. God Less of Divine!
15703,His course is a great effort for personal development and better analysis for influencing tactics you can use and how to protect yourself from being abused by it.
15704,Great vision and lively lectures.
15705,The course is awesome!
15706,"Overall, this was an excellent introductory course. The instructor presented the material in a very clear manner and introduced all topics using applied examples. The weekly assignment were signed with the course content as well, allowing me to apply the knowledge learned in each lesson."
15707,very useful for of psychology students!
15708,"touched the most important concepts like prototyping, creating user stories and removing ambiguities in the user stores."
15709,soon...basis of the introductory course for corporate finance.And highly recommend the suggested book written by the speaker Prof. Lavish <understanding finance>
15710,really helpful!
15711,Incredibly useful for anyone. I'm very glad I had the opportunity to learn in this course.
15712,Is very Interesant
15713,Great course. Incredibly helpful.
15714,"Very good course. It started a bit slow and sped up abruptly in Week 3, but overall a very good course."
15715,"Great course, very information! Learn how to get paid, not played."
15716,thanks for this best memorial for telecommunication satellite :)
15717,Excellent Course For Newcomers to HTML.
15718,Thorough content and great examples. Nodules are well segment and laws cover modern tools
15719,Excellent course that helped my organisation ability improve immensely.
15720,good course
15721,Very accessible and information. I wish there was more information on the issues and tends in photography and less on who said what. The first three nodules are very interesting
15722,the lab was fascinating . i never seen those big machine in my life. THANKS!!!
15723,"Great bite-size lessons, very information and interesting. Thank you!"
15724,I learned a ton in this course & I am looking forward to expanding my skill this is a great course!
15725,A wonderful course. I gained a lot of useful information. Fig thanks to all the authors of the course and wish them all health and new achievements.
15726,"Good course,is very good fo me"
15727,"West computer programming series I've taken in Coursera so far (I've done principles 1 and algorithm thinking 1 already and in parallel). You can start in this very basic course and end in Algorithm Thinking which is a great course full of insight even for an experienced programme as I'm (same is valid for the principles of programming, especially regarding the testing assignment) with no previous experience. By nephew is 15 years old and in high school and he is loving this course (having hard time though). To me, this specific course was very basic but as I didn't know anything of Python and as I love games I enjoyed a lot even though I already knew all of the material except for the Python part."
15728,His course is very fantastic and rich with a lot of important information about logistics that will help you in the daily challenges at your work
15729,"The instructor a fantastic comedy do! I had numerous laugh out loud moments while getting a much better handle on machine learning. The instruction is clear and the homework are always interesting and well thought out.I really only have one complaint: Graphlab. Graphlab is a fantastic piece of software that makes data science easy. I was amazed at how much harder it was for me to complete the home works with spirit and hands. Unfortunately, it's very unlikely that any future employer will be using Graphlab. It's a great into for boots (like me), but it's very expensive and can be implicated with open source packages. Is such, I had to spend a lot of time trying to figure out on my own how to perform graph lab operations in the open source world. Avoiding this kind of slow, frustration, stick exchange singing, 50 tax opening, nonsense is one of reasons I take MOOCs in the first place. I hope a future version sets up the bones of what open source packages can be used to solve each problem set.In summary, I really enjoyed this class. I was excited to work on it. I learned things that made me more productive at work. I felt the joy of learning. I was disappointed by the insistence on Graphlab but if making the sales case for it is what motivate Parlor and Emily to put the class together, it's worth the frustration. I'm extremely grateful to both of them for putting this together."
15730,"Maybe a little too short. Quite easy on the quires too. The information is very good though. Any of these technique I am already doing, so this was more of an affirmation of being on the right track for me than much of anything else."
15731,"One of the most interesting and fantastic courses I have ever take! Unlike traditional classes, this shows you how to study and how use your ""brain"" efficiently"
15732,Wonderful learning! Thanks to all the instructor for sharing their excitement and expertise and research!
15733,great course
15734,It was a very information and useful course for officials involving business writing. I feel considerable improvement in my writing after passing of this course.
15735,"A fantastic course that should be considered as a requirement for any one working as a software developer. The tutors did an excellent job here, the course material was clear, and the assignment were fun and rewarding.I can honestly say I've now built my own computer from simple And gates and it was fun and educational."
15736,Great for introduction to this area.It let us think we understood wide area of machine learning but in fact it's not so simple and not comprehensive.
15737,Great course!
15738,I love the way the professor takes his courses
15739,"West of the specialization!!!!!! Amazing instructor, senators and course material!!!"
15740,"Very good course, I learned a considerable amount from it."
15741,His course is really inspiring and interesting too and the main is the teaching aids of Or. Chuck and his friendly behaviour make too curious about the course material all about a good course.
15742,"It reaches you the basis of html iss and javascript. For a started course in speck. it is ok. I expected a little more from this course, but all in all it was good."
15743,Fool
15744,"By name is Rose Antonio from Brazil. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career.Please, take a look at my LinkedIn profile: http://www.linked.com/in/joseantonio11I did this course to get new knowledge about Fig Data and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructor.Regards"
15745,One of the best courses I've attended.
15746,Very great to have a course centered on installing and using the required software.
15747,Good contents
15748,"The course was very concise and accessible. I enjoyed the fact that there was a lot of people involved in the course, each one of them presenting their field of expertise. Sometimes a quit-based course can be a bit dull, but the hangouts and comments let you question certain topics or practices and add depth to the discussion. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a brief, general introduction to animal behaviour and welfare (do keep in mind that it is not an animal ethics course, but the information provided can help you question or strengthen ethical positions)."
15749,Well structures content and great explanation on concepts. I really like the concept challenge portion as it helps dig into the application of the concepts explained in the lecture. It would have been better if the lecture sides were available in pus.
15750,"Useful for picking up the basis and was easy to complete around a busy, full-time schedule."
15751,"I'm actually writing my first of series pilot. His is the furthest I've ever gotten. I love this course. Thanks to David Wheeler, everyone at Michigan State University and Coursera for making this accessible to so many. Sending tons of gratitude from Vanilla Horsford."
15752,Amazing course!
15753,The content is very similar to the Marketing analysis in practice one
15754,To far I love it!
15755,Amazingly well put together! To well presented as well!
15756,"Excellent coverage of algorithmic technique in this course, with very accessible introduction to such fundamental topics as the Master Method, greedy algorithm design, and dynamic programming. His class hits the sweet spot for people who find Him Roughgarden's Analysis and Design of Algorithms course too intense and hand-wavy, but who still want mathematically-sound, proof-based discussion of algorithmic technique. (Listen to Roughgarden's drive-by treatment of Karatsuba's algorithm in his first week of lectures, and you will appreciate Veil Rhodes' coverage of the same algorithm all the more.) You get an introduction to a lot of ""greatest hits"" from Computer Science, but at a level where you come away understanding the technique. The problem sets start off with fairly easy exercises, just enough to reinforce your understanding, and progress up to exercises that will prove challenging indeed to newcomers. You will get a lot out of careful study of this course. I look forward to continuing in this specialization."
15757,Excellent course! It gave me the opportunity to bethink
15758,Covers the basis pretty well. His should leave you with a good understanding of what responsive design is. The Bootstrap exercises help greatly in providing that.
15759,"Extremely interesting course, which widen our outlook on the management"
15760,Vice introductory Course
15761,Great course; great thoughts. Any ways to reach happiness and easy tips. That I appreciated the most were the references to back the course. I recommended it to at least 5 people. Unfortunately it's not available in French.
15762,"Really a good course in the field of wind energy.you could learn a lot,"
15763,good course
15764,"Very interesting introduction to functional programming and Scala. The assignment are a bit tough/abstract at first with the home-made data structures, but things get more grounded by the end. Odersky's lectures vary between nuts-and-bolts and heavier stuff, but they're all delivered in a clear, organized, and subtly enthusiastic fashion."
15765,"By first course on Coursera, and it was a pleasure. Professor G was awoke, he explained the mathematical background of the algorithms so that everyone could understand it. I will definitely recommend this course to my friends."
15766,"Really interesting course. Good introduction to the dynamic of group behavior and collaboration. Vice overview of advantages of crowdsourcing, but no mention of any ethical or economic concerns."
15767,"I really enjoyed to learn new things, understand the analysis behind the marketing"
15768,"His is the most interesting class I have ever taken. Learn and enjoy it. Thank you, Andrew G"
15769,Basic information useful for those without much knowledge of nutrition or want a review about healthy eating
15770,only recommended for those who have knowledge in linear algebra and calculus
15771,"Very good course which I'd highly recommend to writer beginners and those, like myself, who need to brush up and learn a few more technique. All the lessons were very useful and the assignment were challenging and interesting"
15772,"Great course, great professor. His course lays the simple groundwork upon which to build the full discipline of investment underwriting and analysis. Took forward to taking the next courses!"
15773,"I highly recommend this course for anyone. You will gain insight and develop strategics for improving your leadership, tearworn and negotiation within your professional and personal life!"
15774,"It's of, I think there's a few areas that could use some more depth of explanation. Is with a few course courses there seems to be an assumption that students know the material being discussed and so it isn't explained. Most of the time in this unit that isn't the case but it does occur a bit."
15775,Very good introduction to of
15776,Expel seems not like the ideal tool for portfolio optimization. A business plan or a net value calculation would have been much more in the spirit of this specialization
15777,I'm now taking this course a second time because it is so absolutely helpful and has really given me a free and friendly place to learn how to use Ableton and get started on music production!
15778,His was the paper I was most looking forward to in the Interaction Design specialisation. Unfortunately it seems as if they ran out of time to design it properly (despite extending its start date several times). I didn't learn what I would've expected and all of the assignment blurred into one another
15779,Really a great set of courses to understand and apply models to many different scenario. I was able to use the skill I learned right away in my profession. Would definitely recommend.
15780,really really nice
15781,"Captivating course, highly motivate instructor, deep thinking and understanding course and materials."
15782,"His is a great course. Excellent history of voting that puts everything in context. Good overview (with details) of how voting machines and systems are vulnerable today taught by a professor that is good at what he does and enthusiastic about the topic.Although it is not presented this way, this is a good course for those in CyberSecurity.One of the better Coursera courses available."
15783,I love the professor
15784,class is wonderful!
15785,good start that digs into the very basis
15786,Pretty Excellent! The concepts and principles given here describe and give us a true cosmovision of life.
15787,"I have some suggestions:1. Use consistent English throughout the course due to this is an English class.2. one ""unload"" button is enough in the assignment . . . so it doesn't confuse people. Specify the minimum grade to pass the assignment if it 80%, then say 80% . . .However, overall the course is good, and I love learning other culture! Mind of a new experience for me. Thank you very much! ^_^ Lie Lie . . ."
15788,"great course and its intensive learning . One might think its just another course . However, one needs to follow all the lectures and notes closely to be able to pass all their assignment ."
15789,Very applicable and engaging assignment.
15790,"The course shows the basic concepts in analysis. I like the structure of it, each lesson has its objectives and conclusion, and presents the concepts in a clear manner."
15791,it is a best way to keep our family members healthy.
15792,"Excellent Course, really I gained a lot of information and a lot of expert"
15793,"excellent material on how find opportunities an develop then, from the idea to prototyping"
15794,I really enjoyed it :)
15795,everything is fine but the music before each lecture is so loud and annoying
15796,"EnjoyaOverall, very useful introduction."
15797,His course is a jumpstarter for those who are new to modeling and their real world applications in business.
15798,"Was a better course than the other reviews tended to complain about. Taking the examples literally might not be the best actionable route to completing a lot of the quires and final exam, its mostly theory on how to build sustainable and efficient systems while at the same time ensuring the security of them has the least effect on the liability of the information system or applications in mind.Some of the video were somewhat off topic and seemed to not actually be related to what was on the quires at the end of the weeks topic. Some questions on quires weren't explained or only hinted at in the video only to be the main topic in the next week. Other than that, a solid course."
15799,Great class
15800,"Great course, explained very well!"
15801,Really useful
15802,His course was extremely information and easy to understand. I feel that
15803,It was a great course and so much information. I would surely like to get more knowledge and insight of the topic discussed.
15804,The analysis and materials of this course are very useful. A great section. Of the MATLAB script for calculating the converted Poles and Terms can be provided will be even better.
15805,"Excellent course, covers a lot of content and is easy to understand."
15806,"The classes are very didactic, however the professor sometimes leaders too much and doesn't get to the point. Also, some of the the quires have little or nothing to do with the video lessons."
15807,Awesome Course
15808,Great challenging course !
15809,A very useful course for anyone who has involvement in helping to provide care for the elderly.
15810,very good course for those who are new in this area.
15811,Great course in every meaning
15812,Absolutely loved this course
15813,"Inspiring assignment! the instructor has a warm encouraging laura around him that made me want to listen to him. Also, he is very clear and thorough"
15814,"His is a real free and excellent course for anyone who wants to learn all the fundamentals of Python data structures! Thank you, Or Chuck!"
15815,can be much better with little bit of more explanations and more relevant resources for help
15816,"His course is terrible for many reasons. Firstly, the amount of content is ridiculously small - only about 20 minutes of video lectures per week. Moreover, more than 50% of content is just non-relevant.Secondly, practical assignment are very poorly planned:1) in weeks 3 peer grade assignment students are asked to save Tableaux workbooks as two files, even though this feature is not supported by Tableaux Public that is used in this course. The assignment itself is just opening and saving file in Tableaux.2) in weeks 4 peer grade assignment you just asked to write some vaguely defined 1 page description. It doesn't include any Tableaux-related activities.Thirdly, quires are ambiguous and very general.Overall, this course is just a waste of time. For comparison, you can easily get more useful information about Tableaux from the 4 minute long ""Getting started"" video on the Tableaux webster than from this course. Must wonder how Coursera allows such courses to be places on the platform."
15817,"To words to describe Or.From's amazing lectures. A Must do session for those people, who are not only interested in neuroscience, but had the curiosity to wonder about our brains contemplation our world and also contemplation itself contemplation the world!"
15818,Significantly recommendable for the people who can do self-learning. Prof Andrew always try to teach with easy way. His lecture has good balance for the theory and practice. Also many assignment improved my knowledge and skill about machine learning. Thank you Andrew!
15819,awesome insight from a more scientific perspective
15820,"Initially I was skeptically if I would be able to focus and complete the course. Though I had a slow start and off-and-on but after week 2, I got addicted to this class and I was surprised that I could focus with education and complete it. His was possible because the course was well structures, smooth transition of topics and continuity, well explained with good practical examples, well balanced with machine learning concepts, and mathematics. The quit's really made us understand better as I had to red some quit's. The programming examples increased my confidence.Good part is,while going thou the course and as I learnt new algorithms,I was getting lot of ideas how I can use this in my current work and how it would help things get better.Great job !! and Thank You."
15821,really useful and powerful!
15822,The Course is excellent. It gives a good overall view on many important aspects. The Assignment are too easy while giving the correct building blocks for writing your own programs.
15823,Felt somewhat light on substance.
15824,Very useful for just about any field of interest!
15825,"Difficult subject to get your head around but ultimately worth the effort. The teaching, as always with the University of Albert's MOOCs, is second to none."
15826,Brilliant Course!
15827,"Run teacher to watch, making video lessons never boring and enjoyable."
15828,"Prof. Charles use a number of easy-understanding samples to get student involved in computing logic. I like his humor, his education and his special manner of being interactive with remote students."
15829,I Moved Or. David Wheeler's method. I will knoll in his course/courses over and over again since I want to learn more.
15830,"Super course. You get through a lot of aspects of object tormented programming in JAVA. The course has a very good balance between learning, doing and thinking."
15831,Great Course to get started on R from zero. Thanks a ton to the Instructor .
15832,Was been very interesting and mind powerful course.Thanks for sharing the science !!!
15833,"I learn a lot from this lecture, and thanks."
15834,"it is basic lecture to understand logistic, I recommend you guns to listen this lecture and improve your skill"
15835,Great course
15836,"Very Good Lecturer,Easy to understand and really useful course."
15837,"I liked that course and also the specialization very much. Very new subject to me, and it was fun to learn this stuff."
15838,"Excellent course! Thoroughly enjoyed learning about sustainable development from Or Geoffrey Each, I especially liked that every week addressed a different topic and how he explained everything so clearly. The only suggestions I would make is to regularly review quit and final tests links as they were sometimes broken/outdated resulting in missing question("
15839,"His course is a great way for the beginning program to get started. It is a fast, easy to understand explanation of Scratch. Great lectures with clear instruction. I really enjoyed this class."
15840,Great Learning!
15841,"Fantastic course, so interesting! Moved every lesson. Will be recommending this course to all my friends. Thanks to the U of A for putting it together. Congrats to Mrs. In and Robinson for a job well done. An hardly wait until Mountains 201 is offered. To appreciative."
15842,"In interesting topic, presented well by the instructor and reinforced by intermediate-level programming assignment."
15843,Great!
15844,Operator answer in a very short time. I was impressed of that. I think the course should add a video to explain more in details some concept as variable. many of my issues were coming from deep doubts i had about this. maybe explain variable on hardware and variable as printers.
15845,"His requires a high level understanding of baths (highest high school level) especially of, and opponents. It is not suitable for people with no background in baths or physics"
15846,It is the best course for the beginners who want to learn cava differently.
15847,Great course on Functional programming with Scala! The course and concepts may be a bit challenging depending on the prior programming experience but good course to understand the core concepts
15848,"I was pretty disappointed with this course. Firstly, the course did not seem well balanced meaning that some weeks--particularly week 2--had A LOT of materials to watch and really felt like it was two weeks crammed into one, and then other weeks barely had anything.Secondly, the exercises seemed unclear, poorly thought out and not really helpful. There were many erratic that really should have been fixed in the beta operations of this course.Thirdly, I really would like to see more application and less discussion of implementing algorithms.Fourthly, the ""sealing"" section was also a major disappointment. While it is mildly interesting to learn about stochastic radiant descent, I think it would have been more interesting to have a discussion about how classified work in a parallelized computing environment or actually to try one out using Park.Finally, given that GraphLab/Dato/Yuri was just acquired by Apple, I question whether it is worthwhile to take this course as ALL the materials are taught using a library that in all likelihood will cease to exist."
15849,Well presented.
15850,Great course for the persons having a first hand at AngularJS.
15851,"It is a good introduction to data analysis technique and methodologies. However, I think there is over-repetition of basic points which undermine the more subtle, yet significant, points."
15852,"Amazing course by Or. Pale Curved! His is my second course from Duke University and i absolutely loved it all! His course was very unique in itself ! i.e It involved much more than just assignment. The final test which involved writing an essay which had to be peer reviewed was a good experience. Also reviewing the work done by fellow students have to be noted for it would be an amazing experience for anyone taking this course! I am very much looking for ward for such courses in future. Thank You Or.Curves, Coursera and Duke University for this course!"
15853,Very good! Very interesting how to design a eCRF for a clinical trial
15854,Great Experience!! well explained I am loving this course and I am learning a lot
15855,"I cannot recommend this course enough! Although I have developed software professionally for almost 20 years, some areas beneath the high-level languages I create software with felt like dark mysteries. His course was extremely helpful in illumination many of those areas. Of you develop software professionally but did not graduate college with a computer science degree, I highly recommend this course to you."
15856,Very helpful and give new insight that lead to a better understanding of Python and its strength
15857,I found this course a very inspiring a thoughtful experience. It gives you direction provides you a meaningful path to follow.
15858,"I wish the programming environment would be portable, so I did not invest my time in learning this in deep, I stay with my Tax/Ableton. From the other point of view I liked this Course very much, it would be very interesting seeing more Links or Examples where I can deepen my interest."
15859,"His course is a unique opportunity to learn photography, Professors Glendinning and Sullivan share all their knowledge with us, thanks!"
15860,"Very interesting and well organised course where you can learn the basis of food, nutrition and health"
15861,"His is just a poor sample of a course. Very few material, low quality assignment and trading."
15862,I truly enjoyed this course. The lectures were well designed and auto-grade worked well. The interview materials were great. Right work load for working professional.
15863,"His course reaches absolute basis when it comes to programming, with a few tips that give you an edge when it comes to professional coming."
15864,"His course has certainly introduced me to the world of programming, I certainly did not think it would be this easy to grasp, in such a short space of time."
15865,"His set of video really gives you a complete view of what sustainability must deal with and I really liked the type of tests used as they are not about how much you can memories, but how able you are to analyze. It looked me a while, but I really liked it."
15866,"That's a great course, for sure. Thanks to Mrs Valley and Or Sejnowski for sharing their knowledge with us."
15867,Great. That's exactly what I need. I am starting a new company now.
15868,Great class. Deep up the good work!
15869,"Professor Shapiro is one of the finest instructor who have chosen to offer their courses on Coursera. His knowledge is deep, his ability to explain and clarify subtle concepts is superior and the manner in which he reaches the material covered is sound. To have the chance to hear his tutoring is a real opportunity that anyone who has interest in the study of political or political ethics should not miss. A fine course. Bravo!"
15870,"Wonderful experience. It first, I dreaded the idea of actually having to create a project. Mostly, my concern stemmed from the idea that I'd be too far ahead of my peers and it'd take too long to get feedback. I'm happy to see that others were working ahead as well."
15871,Excellent practical application of the knowledge gained! Chateau!
15872,A very comprehensive course which is a great introduction to wind energy.
15873,A great course to get an introduction to strategy.
15874,"Of you want to get an idea about the wind energy and the whole process, except installation, it is really useful and complete."
15875,"Great user friendly tools, but audit did not function appropriately"
15876,Good course
15877,Conceptually conducing with detailed explanations! Thank you!
15878,"His course was very knowledgeable. I found a great opportunity and a platform to learn something. Everything was awesome. And, I learned a lot."
15879,Very Good!
15880,really great. thanks
15881,Great. Too useful. Excellent professor.
15882,Great course. I am happy that I could participate.Ernest
15883,"His course is good for beginners. It is really ""Programming for Everybody""."
15884,Extremely knowledgeable teacher!! You will learn amazing facts and details of the rise of rock music.
15885,"Simple and clear way to approach food, but it would be great if we could add more nutrition science and physiology based into"
15886,The course explains basis of using Tableaux as on approach for data visualization very well. I particularly liked this course for teaching me the basic presentation skill and expressing them through tableaux. The final project allows you to showcase the learnt skill. Thanks everyone !!!
15887,"The course is quite good and information in the first two weeks covering a lot of information and a lot of exercises.Week 3 is very unrelated and hard the video and exercises are bad, and I had to do this part by myself again.Also when we get to the final course project doesn't cover any of these technique.In my opinion, week 3 should be replaced with something more related to clotting systems and distribution, also one project would be enough."
15888,"I had tried my hands at writing before, but this course gave a better rounding in the skill of writing a story. I feel more confident now . The module presentations were interesting and I particularly liked the interviews accomplished authors."
15889,Very clear
15890,I am really enjoying the course. A lot more practical than other courses I have taken. It would be good to have an option to submit assignment and purchase the certificate at the end rather than the current way. Hope Course will take this into consideration.
15891,His course is the second couresera course which completed. It is always nice to learn from people who do frontier work in the field they teach. I thank course for giving me this wonderful opportunity. Sakthivel
15892,Its really good course to take up if you want to know about IOT in simple language. I enjoyed it
15893,Very Vice Hours
15894,"Parallel Programming course in Scala will help you to program at a higher level, reason about task and data parallel programs, express common algorithms in a functional style and solve them in parallel, competent microbenchmark parallel code, and write programs that effectively use parallel collections to achieve performance. The course content was well organized and it had in - depth assignment which were relatively difficult for me to complete. I would recommend this course to everyone, and one should take it only after taking the 'Fundamental Programming Principles in Scala' and 'Functional Program Design in Scala' courses."
15895,Perfect!
15896,His is a very engaging course that almost feels like a documentary. You end up learning a great deal and it is very effective in sparkling interest in the subject.
15897,Very good course. Thanks
15898,Excellent course. Good teacher and dynamic learning.
15899,"The course is good, Examples are briefly explained. It doesn't cover a couple of subjects, but still good."
15900,Mind it really useful and like the short video for every module
15901,Very good and basic patron language course
15902,Great course =)
15903,"Good introduction course, but I hoped that there would be more assignment. Completed course in 3 days"
15904,very useful and interesting introduction to strategic thinking.
15905,It is too small and shallow. Whole specialization is actually one full course split into 4 tiny parts.
15906,I had no previous experience in the area and after this course i feel like i can actually support others in their development plans. I highly recommend this course to everyone.
15907,"I didn't find the overall content of the course very well chosen for an introduction to philosophy - since it covers so little. The title of this course should have been ""In Introduction to Must a Couple of Topics in Philosophy."" And there are so few philosophers covered. However, the biggest problem was instructorAlasdair Richmond, whose response to debate was locking threads down every time his ideological positions were challenged. He showed himself completely inert to have a debate with more than one course participant and chose to censor a variety of viewpoint he dislikes. It was particularly ironic to see an instructor exercise censorship in a Philosophy course - a domain whose objective, after all, is the pursuit of truth as well as to ask and debate the ""why"" of everything! A petty tyrant does not make a good teacher.Should I ever meet anyone interested in studying Philosophy, my first recommendation to them will be stay away from the University of Edinburgh, since there is no respect for debate, freedom of expression, or inquiry there."
15908,Excellent course contents and a logical structures organization of the topics.
15909,I did this course for and time. The course is very interesting & information. Thank you Coursera & Maiden University.
15910,Awesome Course. Very timely and with sufficient information
15911,"Leaps of practical knowledge on building machine learning applications, as well as a deeper understanding of how machine learning models work, can perform better and in which areas they can be applied. Not surprisingly considered one of the best online classes out there."
15912,Very easy to follow and great explanations!!!
15913,Awesome course and instructor
15914,Good information given. Thanks.
15915,His is one of the best courses i have taken ever.
15916,I enjoyed this course. The materials are presented in an easily understandable manner. The exercises are fun and good for learning.
15917,"His course improved my writing skill in a tangible way - I will apply it both for my aspiration to become a writer as well as to express myself better at work. By main improvement is in structure and understanding more about editing process, getting rid of unnecessary part of the outcome."
15918,"interesting and comprehensible, very enthusiastic teacher!"
15919,you should consider issues to unload 54Mo data during peer review trading of last assignment.so this course was information and well structures.thanks a lot
15920,"I have to say, I am disappointed in that I feel there is little to no interaction here between students and instructor/aides. Additionally, the assignment are not sanctioning properly and it creates much confusion. The instructor video are great and have been helpful but the rest is lacking! There is no way to view other's bodies of work and critique are very vague, etc. His is photography... where is the photography from earners (other than the assignment)? Why is there no gallery here?"
15921,Awesome course!
15922,Not hard but many new stuff!
15923,"it was great , and its teacher was greater :)"
15924,"Great review of various aspects of mechanical engineering, a ""must"" for any engineer"
15925,Love how clear the professors explain the not-so-straightforward context. I enjoyed every single moment. The assignment constitute the biggest part of understanding and learning.
15926,A though class. But I think I learned so much. Anyone who interested in working an area related to fMRI should take it
15927,Faced right for a person working a full time job and Or. Chuck explains the material in an easy to understand fashion. Well worth the time to take this class.
15928,Fantastic course. Really insightful!
15929,Fantastic! Open a new gate for me.
15930,Great course. Well designed and challenging programming assignment that stimulate learning.
15931,Good course for learning
15932,"what an organized , clear and understandable video and content ,"
15933,"Very well paced, with very clear explanations and interesting insight."
15934,It is extremely contemporary and a very useful course!
15935,"Brilliant course!His course it taught by two amazing professors- Parlor Guestrin and Emily Box. In the very first session itself, they make it crystal clear that they love what they do, and in the subsequent video they show you why you should get excited as well.The course puts remarkable emphasis on the concepts rather than raw code, and once you're propped on the fundamentals, you're gently introduced into the code. His to me is a wonderful way to go about a new subject.The sides are simple and clean, the work of a brilliant team shines through the entire time. Parlor and Emily are really funny and you just fall in love with this course because of these two exceptional teachers.Without a doubt- highly recommended."
15936,"A good sycosis of the history of Israel. I enjoyed learning about this subject, and especially enjoyed the interviews and conversations."
15937,In EXCELLENT course on Applied Cryptography!!!!
15938,"Very helpful information. I could use more printers on how, precisely, to do the ""Intervention"" phase - more practical. Thanks!"
15939,"The course goes into a reasonable depth of the area. I particularly like the expel models for pricking of various financial instruments. By only suggestion is to provide more supplementary material like open source books, research papers etc on the topic so that one can expand their knowledge even further."
15940,Great ! Nothing to add
15941,"His is perfect for earners who want to study basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, cava script. Professor accent and speaking speed are easy to be understood."
15942,Very nice course!!!
15943,West introduction to of
15944,I found week two to really outweigh the others in terms of difficulty in the assignment but It's probably the week I learnt the most! Great Mob!!
15945,His is an excellent course. Very clear lectures with good real world examples. Highly recommended!
15946,A brilliantly presented course that can be life changing if followed as presented.
15947,I thoroughly enjoyed the course. I was disappointed that there was not more participation in the forms from other classmates. I found Or. Valley's methods of teaching very creative and assisting in the learning process. The testing did indeed help my learning as it showed where I was wrong and gave me the opportunity to correct it. The outside reading was also helpful in understanding the material.
15948,Excellent! Very easy to follow and with good piece of patron knowledge. I would do the tasks a bit more demanding.
15949,Difficult to follow with no live coming.
15950,the of the best available courses :)
15951,Amazing!!! so much to learn! super interesting... I'm so glad I found this.
15952,Fantastic course. The assignment especially the programming exercises are challenging and gives a head start into this complex world of machine learning. Need to keep practicing these algorithms to keep in touch with the knowledge learnt from this course. Highly recommend!
15953,"Useful. I feel some areas such as strategy, getting to MVP etc could benefit from more case studies and materials to work through. The overall content of the lectures is good but to internalise it there needs to be more 'work' for the students to engage in rather than just a quit at the end."
15954,Excellent Course! I found both the Loud Computing Concepts highly information and relevant for the course objective.
15955,Absolutely brilliant course. I have done a few courses on Coursera and this is the best so far. Michael Charm is a great teacher and makes difficult topics easy to understand and the questions during the video help you focus and show you which bits you should re-watch.Would definitely recommend this.
15956,I enjoyed doing this course thoroughly.
15957,Good course. It an introduction to CSS because this language has a lot of things to study. But for begging's is excellent opportunity.
15958,A truly excellent course.
15959,In amazing world is discovered!
15960,Very information course. I like it a lot so far
15961,"I didn't expected so clear explanations.Well, my impression is that the inability still exists and this is in the circular dependencies that can exist in the new system. Once the mechanism get fast enough the crisis may appear.There is some parallel with computer systems. In the early days of the interconnected computers the problems were much similar. I hope I could write something until the end of the course.I would like to have some more schematic explanation of the institutions and the flow of money and the other financial products. Is well as some textbook references. It is a little bit complicated to the non-american to enter fluid at least in the set of abbreviations."
15962,"Quite fast-paced indeed. Even the instructor seem like they're in a rush :)It would have helped if there was a glossy of terms for people who aren't well-versed in programming basis.But in summary, it's an interesting course =)))"
15963,It's ok. Leading the top three books on time management would take less time and provide far more insight and inspiration.
15964,"Great, moderately advanced material, that will boost your knowledge on neutral nets."
15965,"The course was very interesting and rich, with wonderful illustrations and examples. Thank you very much Professor Julian Birkinshaw for useful materials and assignment, as well as a special thank you Nursery team for organizing such training courses"
15966,His was by far the best class I have had so far on Coursera. I feel that I now have a really good understanding of linear and logistic repression and neutral network as well as the other learning methods that we touched upon. I thought that the quires and assignment were very appropriate and helped me to further cement my understanding that I gained through watching the video. Professor Ing explains the material very clearly. I always walked away feeling that any questions I might have were answered completely in the video or in the discussions. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to have a good understanding of Machine Learning.
15967,"Although this course was intended as an advanced English grammar review, I could learn a lot of new things I'd never studied before. I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot from it."
15968,"His is a course for those who have not spent any time delving into comparative religion and testing their own traditional (family taught) belief systems with thoughts of act versus ""true."""
15969,I totally recommend this. Prof. An explains each and every concept very well.
15970,"It provides good resources and code, but if you get stuck, there's no help. By the time one gets this far the participation has plummeted and there's no senators or instructor help. Very frustration to get this far only to be stopped because you're on your very own."
15971,His course helps to become good in learning fundamentals of R Programming language. The assignment were challenging and helped me learn a lot
15972,"very nice , thanks to Andrew of !"
15973,"Although the content is good, the course itself does not reflect in any way what a good asynchronous course should be. There is the discussion board? Now can one communicate with the instructor or with other classmates? Although peer review of an assignment is one aspect of asynchronous and synchronously education, said assignment should also be reviewed by an instructor, especially when said instruction carries so much weight. In addition, I think overall the tests are unfair. I was marked wrong twice for a question that asked my opinion! Also, in the ""check all that apply"" questions, if one misses one of the answers, the whole question is marked wrong. Finally, many of the test questions themselves are irrelevant to the content of the course. One last thing- the course says it's a five week program, but there are only 4 weeks. Something needs to be adjusted."
15974,Really good and organised course! And the assignment are so good and helpful to understand!
15975,very interesting
15976,"I have almost completed week one. I learned about what words to stress in a sentence and how to use the innovation at the end of the sentence. It is fun to go through the course contents. I would have given it five stars when it actually have helped us by giving analogies on more conversations formally and informally. Well, thank you."
15977,I am very much thankful to Or Andrew of for designing this entire course in such a beautiful way that it had made my Machine Learning concept so clear. Now I can commence my of research work.
15978,rich and engaging documentaries took 80% of the class content - but still fun to watch!
15979,I took this course to explore what Forensic Accounting and Fraud Examination entailed and if it would be something I would want to pursue in the future. The instructor were excellent and delivered a considerable amount of information that was clear and interesting.
15980,Very good course. Introductory.
15981,"Good, but not so deeply good"
15982,It was a pleasant experience after taking this comprehensive course. I learnt a lot from an experienced faculty.
15983,Andrew reaches concepts in a very practical way.
15984,It gives a good overview how CSS works
15985,Its awesome....and fantastic course
15986,West webster introduction course. Period. Thank you Mrs An Went.
15987,"Very good for beginners, Strongly suggest new programs to take it!"
15988,Amazing course.
15989,Great class! Absolutely enjoyable!!
15990,Excellent! Especially seeing how easy to convert existing webster developed in previous courses using Bootstrap and/or AngularJS to an Android or in application.
15991,By first coming program online
15992,That a great course which helps me understand more about the correlation between nutrition and human being health. Highly recommend.
15993,Great contents! It is very well developed by new additional resources and links comparing to last year. Thanks Coursera!
15994,"Its level increases gradually, the lectures have been explained in a lucid manner and there is a lot to gain from this course"
15995,was helpful in laying the foundations of my programming skill
15996,Very interesting course. It would be useful to download slide used during video.
15997,A lot of work but an incredibly rewarding learning process. I'm very glad I took it.
15998,It helped me a LOT! Thank you for this course!
15999,Vice introductory course to learning both SAS and Python in data analysis! I look forward to taking the next course!
16000,Incredible level of teaching.
16001,Very clear and didactic. Useful concepts to the point.
16002,"The course is highly information, engaging and overall very well-designed."
16003,"Good explanations and detailed. Interesant concepts, developed in a comfortable way."
16004,"updated , easy to understand and great professor combination all of those quality make this course one of the best courses i ever take it"
16005,"Great Instruction, very easy to follow:clear examples and explanations."
16006,"His course is very well organized, has a ton of very practical information I could not find anywhere, all made available at your fingertips. I really enjoyed all the material, and am grew in confidence in analyzing big data from biomedical domain. Thank you for spending the time putting all this material together !"
16007,"His is a great course, simple to understand and well-taught by Mean Woman."
16008,Very nice and eye-opening class. Jena presented very well. I have learnt a lot from this class. Thank you Jena!
16009,"Great introductory course! I had no doubt that there was a connection between what we eat and our health, but I had very little to no idea how much microbes are involved in our being. I enjoyed this course very much and will recommend it to others!Thank you!"
16010,"Very impressive course.The content is perfect for understanding the main topic of experiencing marketing about the management of arts.I think many lessons are useful no only for cultural institutions, but also for entertainment industries such as moves, theaters and sports, because the main concept of customer satisfaction and experimental marketing can be applied to the entertainment industry as well.I've taken the other courses offered by Bocconi and are always excellent , in terms of content quality and professors.Compliments to all involved into the idea creation and realization of this course.Andrew"
16011,"I love these two guns, since they can convey their ideas vividly with big smile, which is pretty cool!"
16012,Learned a lot
16013,"Very good course, definitely spared my interest in programming."
16014,"It is very nice to see an introductory course in linguistic, especially for it being free and available online. I would not have had an opportunity like that anywhere here locally, which makes this course special to me. The instructor and his pupils were paramount to the learning experience, and with the addition of interviews and recommended reading, this course excess in practically defining and showing what linguistic do and what they study. I want to thank Maiden University and Arc van Oostendorp for providing such a professionally delivered MOOC."
16015,Great
16016,Very interesting and also made me more knowledgeable on the general subject of of security.
16017,Owesome course! with a lot of creative ideas and examples for time management
16018,"the course is amazing , there is much knowledge in here !!Enjoyed every week and every lectureThe instructor is funny and never gets you bored !the missing star is for the tasks, they need to be a bit more challenging"
16019,"very good teacher, thanks for bring me into the machine learning world Andrew!!!"
16020,"Sometimes the course may feel too basic, but it makes everything very clear. Closed lots of gaps in my knowledge about machine learning. The only regret I feel that the course does not cover decision trees and bayesian network."
16021,Some
16022,Awesome Course!
16023,The course is great for beginners into the filed of learning to be reporting. I am happy i signed up for it though it was a bad time at work to focus on the course but I did. I look forward to completing the remaining courses required for specialisation. Thankyou course and the Michigan State University for the opportunity.
16024,"Even though this course requires completion of tough assignment, I believe that this gave me a chance to understand and grasp core concepts about data structure and also about programming skill."
16025,I really enjoyed learning! Very interactive!
16026,"His is an excellent survey of the long with Century through of of with a marvelous ' lagniappe' of very thoughtful coverage to 2013. I think that covering the events of the last two generations is very difficult without the credibility gained via a consistent approach to what came before. His course provided that consistency.I now have a new appreciation of 'what came before' and a reminder, thanks to Philip Zelikow, to resist the constraint of thinking only via the history, outlooks and ideas of my lifetime.Highly recommended."
16027,"Exceptional introductory course. Lessons were well organized, different methods were used to perform the same function to show flexibility, simply a pure joy to take!"
16028,Great
16029,"I liked the course. It really is a true beginners' class. I think the instructor taught well with good examples illustrating each point. I deduced a point because the exercises were too easy and there weren't enough of them. I understand that it's not easy to come up with a good trading system, but the trading system definitely could be better."
16030,"His course is the type of course to visit, review, and update yourself. Whenever you are tickling a learning task."
16031,thank you!
16032,Great Course!
16033,"very interesting, well taught"
16034,Wonderful course. Engaging and information.
16035,"Vice course, but could be better supported.Video: In Programs on whiteboard several wrong santa (of/of writing)Letter: Not just there's the do on web - study it - rather point on important things on do and make tests.And of week 4: Second link to program is missing, when making peer review, everyone can learn so much from each other.I Hardware: I missed awfully electric characteristics on GPIO. Looking on the web, anyone was talking about this matter (max. 50mA total all output, max. 3-16mA ?? each...). A little electronics guide how to dimension LED resists and pulleys / pullsdowns and how to drive relays would be nice. Any student know surely less about electronics, but to interact with of it is nessecary.Coursera: Not on all platforms (had i.e.) you can make positive comments when reviewing."
16036,"Crystal clear and well paced lectures, good coverage of several interesting topics, amusing exercises.Thanks professor G and was."
16037,West course for basic Chinese.
16038,Excellent course and very well presented. Some baths knowledge will be great but Andrew gets you through the basic understanding. Advanced calculus would obviously be beneficial but not required. Great course and recommend it to anyone wanting to understand how machine learning works and can be applied to a multitude of scenario
16039,Great presentation of the material.
16040,"It's been real pleasure to learn this course. Interesting and useful issue, great explanation."
16041,"His course provides a concise and balanced look at the aids epidemic,and social responsibility and response to it. I think it is comprehensive in the resources that we can access, additional video, books, professional, advocates and patients. Definitely a good starting off point for someone who wants a detailed introduction to the topic. I will review the materials again and again. Thank you. Good job."
16042,"It's a very good course to start learning statistics! I love instructor, they are so funny!"
16043,Content is interesting but the lectures and the content is far below the first course in the series in my opinion.
16044,"His course is excellent: lots of things covered in depth, learning curve is high, detailed explanations with lots of examples; Of you want to camp up quickly on Structure for Motion or Visual Geometry, Visual SLAM, this is highly recommended. But be prepared to put some real effort in this demanding course. Overall one of the best MOOC I took. Programming assignment and especially the last one are *very* interesting. It's great to have such courses that are available for everybody. Are-requisite are linear algebra (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, Jacobin, Hessian ...) and familiarity with matas (but people familiar with jump should easily camp up). For people not familiar with matas there are also some very nice matas tutorials in the resources. Highly recommended."
16045,"great course, do it again"
16046,Great Course. It´d be awesome if the professor could show us real-life examples.
16047,A fast-paced overview of compilers construction and the associated run time environment.
16048,Great course for those trying to understand how to analyse and process text data. It has the right amount of tools to help you understand the basis of information retrieved and search engines.
16049,It was a really helpful for teaching area and worthy to join this course.
16050,I excellent for beginners who have some previous knowledge in programming or have used any other programming language.
16051,It was a great experience were i learned new things that will improve my life.
16052,Very nice course for people who are new to digital area.
16053,I have learnt a lot from this introduction course. The peer reviewed assignment also give me the opportunities to see works from other students and inspire me more. Thank you!
16054,"Last paced and comprehensive. Also, very good censorship from the teacher."
16055,Excellent foundation course in Entrepreneurship.
16056,A stroke of genius! Well presented in short nodules.
16057,this course is very good. thank you
16058,great and inspiring
16059,I've learnt a lot from the course. Very useful and terrifically interesting.
16060,Recommend for beginners with game design or programming.
16061,"His was a decent course. Some information, big picture information but I felt that it lacked some hands on understanding. The minor hands on laws that were provided, were challenging for anyone that is not familiar with Python script writing. I would suggest that you brush up on that before being comfortable with taking this course."
16062,"Excellent course, highly recommended!"
16063,"Challenging at times, but double with effort, and quite rewarding upon success. Recommended."
16064,Good and basic understanding of terms.An be made vast.
16065,Beer review is really bad idea for such assignment when you are writing your very first design document. It's very subjective and peers cannot provide a valuable feedback on your work
16066,Thank You Or. Chuck for a great course for a good foundation on data structures in Python!
16067,"I enjoyed the earlier courses more. I did not like the way the materials were provided. There were a lot of very complex ideas were presented, in a very concise and brief manner. Also, there should be more exercises to practice. May be its me, but, I guess, I might need more time to fully comprehend the materials."
16068,Course is very compact and information
16069,It's a great chance so we get to know important topics that we know very little about! Proffesor Abraham is a professional at the topic. Thanks a lot!
16070,"Although more about Rob and Tat than learning to use Expel, concepts of binary classification and entry are very interesting and are taught very deliberately and thoroughly. More practise quires and worked out examples would be even better."
16071,Well paced course with a wide overview if a bit america-central
16072,"I enjoyed this course very much. His has helped me understanding many basic things about food and what is important for my kiss. There are many little helpful tips. Is a working mother with 2 little kiss, it's so much better to have seen these video of ""simple cooking"", than watching cook shows in of that make cooking so complicated (by learning nothing) and firing. Thanks for this great course and your effort in improving the health of kiss of the world! West regards, Bunyan Boy, a Chinese German mother"
16073,Great class! I really liked the style of teaching and the home assignment.
16074,considerably helpful and well-structures.
16075,Amazing and very information! Highly recommended!
16076,"The touch on a lot of topics, but do not provide nearly enough information to make it worth staying through the course."
16077,"Very information and helped clear up the basic concepts from Probability, Gambling and the inference. Very lucid and easy to understand instructions. Introduction to R Studio was a little dancing for me, as I am unfamiliar, but huge satisfying to grasp the basis and what all it can do for Statistical inference."
16078,"Overall, course quality is good and have a appropriate level of knowledge for new analysis. I will recommend for who begins learning about data analysis.Need improve:Some of the subtitles are wrong.Examinations need have more explanations, they will be helpful when we choose the wrong answer.I need to wait too long for reviewing someone in the end of course. Please consider this."
16079,A very comprehensive course to learn database and related concepts.
16080,"Simple, elegant yet very effective. Andrew G's unique teaching style does justice to the subject and its in depth knowledge."
16081,I really enjoyed the course and it helped me to start creating again.
16082,The teachers are really amazing. They do not just explain it as if they read a book. They explain the concepts very well
16083,It is a very good course. It is loaded of many guided examples.
16084,Learn graph data structures through the creation of a very cool project. Awesome class!
16085,"Good course, a student can catch all necessary skill within the short period of time, thank the awesome professor and the brilliant textbook."
16086,Really useful information. Great work!
16087,Awesome course! Very helpful with a practical / example-driven approach that helps build intuition.
16088,It's very interesting to learn new things.
16089,Concise but not so simple. You can learn more than basic Python. The examples are very clear.
16090,Great introduction to C# and game programming.
16091,Good introduction to JAVA for the intermediate developer.
16092,Great course both lectures and exercises! recommend!
16093,Professor Charles is
16094,Have Dixon's an awesome guy. I love watching his video.
16095,Excellent tutoring and lessons!
16096,Very good introduction to Python and good challenges in the work exercises.
16097,"OMG, I'm so blessed for taking this course, I learned a lot from it, and I highly recommend to others, it's fun and practical."
16098,Simple and clear explanations to solve problems.
16099,"His course is light because it is a survey--a taste--of what the rest will offer. Nonetheless, it sets up a starting point for future classes. The instructor are genial and fun."
16100,Great!
16101,Great course!
16102,I had fun refreshing the basic concepts of HTML and looking at basic h=javascript programs
16103,Terrible. Nobody seems to monitor the forum. To response to questions posted.I want to rate zero but there is no such option available.
16104,Great course so far.
16105,Thoroughly enjoyed this course. Instructor has an engaging way about him and makes the subject matter clear in the lectures. Essay-work was thought-provoking and forced critical analysis about research and reading material.
16106,His is the first time I'm exposed to functional programming and it is amazing.
16107,Great. i learn a lot of think that applicable in my daily life
16108,Fantastic instructor and a great course!
16109,"Andrew G does a great job of explaining all parts of the material, equations, and principles."
16110,"Very nice flow of concepts, good explanation and examples."
16111,"Great stuff! On't give up on the first assignment, the rest are more easier..."
16112,"It's a very basic course to learn a very small things about bootstrap, query and HTML, but I think the level is too advanced for non-programming people, it should be better structures."
16113,The course is like. Very interesting learning.West regards!
16114,"Great course, learned a lot"
16115,Great and helpful Course!
16116,The course is great for people at their fist experience as well as for experts. It is fun and interesting work and it opened my mind to what one can do with a computer.
16117,Great class
16118,"Very well paced, and clearly explained. Transcripts are good though note you'll need to annette them with the equations discussed."
16119,super course Fundamentals of Digital Image and Video Processing
16120,Great course with a lot of useful content
16121,I like this course and I'm going to study all the courses in this specialisation! Thank you!
16122,"Course material was interesting but very rudimentary, the courses biggest challenge was understanding its spoken English. I do not recommend this course."
16123,too fancy and the structure is not very clear. Not very much learned.
16124,The professor is really information and thoroughly explains the concepts. It's a great course to take as an introduction to Physics.
16125,"That is a great course of Project Management, it is being a excellent introduction to PMBOK!"
16126,"His course is very challenging, but I am enjoying the process of learning this material. Sometimes I feel it is overwhelming, but searching other video on YouTube really helps me out sometimes. I am so proud of what I have accomplished thus far! I can't wait to keep going!"
16127,"I had some issues with this course which is why I rate it a 2.First off, let me start by saying this is a very good overview of what the Cybersecurity Terms are, but I wish it went deeper into the subject.1. Having to pay just to take the quires for an overview course is kind of a joke. I could see asking for money if you went into more detail information regarding each lesson, but just telling me what each term means and then pointing me to a webster, then asking for 50 bucks is kind of cheap considering no in-depth information was ever given.2. Why did you have all of those people that are in the field of cybersecurity just read off a list of terms? You could have done that, kind of a waste of time for those other people. I am guessing that you had to pay them. Which would explain why you are asking 50 dollars just to take the quires.3. There was the real life experience? Explain to me the most common mistakes people make with each of the different type of network as securities. That would at least be worth 50 dollars, for some real world practical use. I could have easily growled these terms and have in the past. I thought it would contain more detailed information about the subject considering is technically an online course."
16128,"Very good review, especially the atomic structure unit. The stoichiometry unit was also very comprehensive. I hope there could be more on gaseous state and solution/acid-base chemistry. Quizzes are very good."
16129,Very Vice. Refresh the mechanics and concepts.
16130,A perfect introduction
16131,"It´s excellent, Very complete. The course increases your perspective.Andrew G excellent teacher, explained for duties."
16132,highly interesting and engaging. great learning experience
16133,Excellent course! The material is information and applicable and it is presented in a clear and efficient manner. Well worth the time!
16134,"His course is one of the best I've taken on Coursera. The lecturer is engaging and makes the subject matter interesting and clear. The exercises are considered and related to the lectures, so can be completed without pain or massive amounts of prior knowledge. It's a course for anyone wanting to brush up their Python - I recommend it!"
16135,Really great and useful!
16136,"A light weight introduction with a wide perspective, a great place to begin."
16137,Very useful!!
16138,Great course. Extremely well-taught!
16139,"His is really impressive, learned a lot"
16140,"His course is a very good option to start your adventure in Ruby on Nails framework. It starts from the very beginning, I mean, you learn some It, how to set up your programming environment in order to use Nails, Ruby and useful tools like PhantomJS, and much more. The grade assignment are way too good, because they force you to learn and use the things you just learned and a little more. I highly recommend it to people with some (but not that much) experience in programming. Thanks!"
16141,I took this course as a review. I took Into. to Materials Science 26-years ago. He used Or. Shackelford's textbook for that class. At
16142,everything what i need to know!
16143,"His topic should be taught as early as possible to students. Some of the more technical explanations made me get a bit lost, but the summarise and practical tips make this course so worth it."
16144,I learned allot and will use the information I gained
16145,First of all i would like to thank everyone who was involved in making of the program. İ think the program has been creativlely well presented. İ am already looking forward to Global Health : In interdisciplinary part two :). Thanks
16146,"The best course in the group, with a lot of masterclass.That' my opinion, and I hate to draw, so this means that I loved this course a lot."
16147,Students be more interactive.
16148,excellent structure and well explained
16149,The difficulty of the assignment increases fairly dramatically week over week. It might be more productive to scale this content more gently by dividing it into a two-part course?
16150,The teachers is the best! tax!
16151,Vice course. Enjoying.
16152,One of the best academic experiences I had.Is a soldier I would recommend it to my fellow soldiers and to my civilian friends so they could understand a little better the parades of war.
16153,Or Charles Severance has made the course even more engaging and interesting.I couldn't have asked for a better enter.Looking forward to attending more of his lectures.Thanks
16154,Great Glasses! Really help me to get started with my patron study! The professor is clear in explanation and humorous as well. Good class for beginners! I will absolutely recommend it and keep on learning the second
16155,"The course itself is good, however the assessment need to be worked on"
16156,"West first course in data science. Gives you a clear mathematical approach to prediction models. The course instructor and the co-founder of Coursera, Prof. Andrew G is really good and motivation too."
16157,"Very nice concise bird's eye view of the subject, which introduces important concepts, principles and practices. Highly useful for the non-financial professional who wants to get a basic understanding of what finance professional are gambling about!"
16158,Great course. Awesome instructor.
16159,Thanks a lot Prof. Uric Rindfleisch and the team behind the course. Thanks for addressing the fundamentals of Marketing in the digital world. It was a great learning experience.

16168,The West! (Quite Tom)
16169,Perhaps assignment were a little to straightforward - I would have enjoyed a more challenging final one.Very well presented and paced
16170,"The material is interesting as well as the lectures. Also, the method of evaluation is very good, as it allows the users to interact with each other."
16171,A great introduction to the real capacities of method.
16172,Good course to learn the basis of epidemiology.
16173,It's soooooooooooo amazing and i'm trying hard and better!
16174,"Its a really well thought course, with clear explanations, complete documentation and well tormented exercises."
16175,WOW!!! By far the BEST Course in Coursera catalogue! Incredible the tools that are taught. Thanks so much. Absolutely recommended for every person regardless of professional background.
16176,Great overview of machine learning technique and practices at a high level! There is sufficient material here to go from no machine learning knowledge (and a general programming background) to being able to create and deploy machine learning models for use in applications.
16177,You didn't give me an Honor Rode Certificate!
16178,It's great and full of useful information
16179,"Only few starting video give new information and technique, the rest 80% is quite useless. Course would be much better if it gives real tips and technique rather than constant repetition of the same information in different forms. Of you read the course contents - you already get 75% of what is presented in the video."
16180,"His was the best class I've ever taken on Coursera. The professor is brilliant and humorous. I was sorry when it ended, and will miss it.Pollen Babington"
16181,Instructor are exemplary. His series is the best drafted that I've seen on-line. Takes me look forward to the next week.

16192,Basic course that covers about how financial market works.
16193,"some of the quires felt haphazard and too specific, but overall, the material was timely and well presented."
16194,I like the Courseware and it is taught very well.
16195,"Opening the quires and the internal crepitation for free should be a most for such a good course like this.Its a shame that ""non premium"" users have access to only the video material."
16196,"Extremely accurate, well designed and explained! Awesome!"
16197,overwhelming
16198,Awesome!!! Great course!!!
16199,The best of the three so far!You really start to interact with the real world. Things start to make sense and patron is really becoming a tool to do some work.
16200,Great course. The instructor is very knowledgeable and gives lots of examples of real companies using merits. There are some good assignment to practice using the things taught in the course. Seems like a good specialization too.
16201,"Excellent course, I recommend to any marketing professional."
16202,Top Glass
16203,A good introductory level course
16204,"I like the practical approach Professor G took toward teaching the different concepts in this course. The focus on real-life applications rather than proving the theories behind each method is great for working professional, and I am now empowered with different ideas to try out at work!"
16205,"Of you look for improving your communication skill, then this course is for you."
16206,A good course for Angular of.
16207,Vice Course! Very useful and information.
16208,His was my first course in Social Sciences and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Prof Right maintains a very fine balance between philosophy and science which makes it suitable for all enthusiast.A good course for beginners in the Buddhist enquiry.
16209,Exceptionally good and clear!
16210,I am in my third week.Its really amazing as I progress in the course.
16211,"His course was great for me. I was looking for a refreshed course since I had some Android experience, but due to different career path I have not used in about 4 years. It was good for me."
16212,"I'm happy to follow this course: it's very useful, and easy to understand in many aspects of this fantastic program language"
16213,The course is really good. The quires and support is really bad as they slow you down and distract with useless issues.
16214,"Fascinating trip through the marvellous Beethoven sonata.Although I love them since many years, I'm very happy to see that It's always possible to progress.Any thanks Jonathan."
16215,"Very good, well structures and explained. I loved the course and its content. I recommend it for who wants to learn Python."
16216,Very good and practical.
16217,I am studying engineering and I wanted to study calculus before I had this discipline in the college. It is helping me a lot so far.
16218,Very very interesting lecture
16219,I'm almost done with the course and really enjoyed everything so far. However please do invest some time to update the course for Python 3. Professor is great and really holds you by the hand; exactly the kind of teaching I needed.
16220,"A shame it is part of the cybersecurity specialization. It is boring and full of obvious-psychology things like ""password need to be secure but easy to remember"". The instructor, at least, seems to have zero knowledge about software development. Everything we did in seven weeks could have been taught in one or two."
16221,Good Loud Competing and CDN lectures and material.Back of practical examples and use cases in Fig Data track.
16222,Great ideas to planning and keeping everything in one place. It has changed my life.
16223,Fantastic into to bring your old knowledge up to date.
16224,It's simple but useful for someone who didn't study computer before this class.
16225,"Excellent course, information is clear and direct."
16226,"His course was a great introduction into the field of Machine Learning, covering multiple approaches and possible applications, all spread between a series of simple projects and easy-to-follow lecture video.Any of the terms used were highly technical, and it could be difficult to keep them separate at times, but the way they were presented offered a chance for association with mathematics rather than just a word.Hated 4/5 for ability to break down complex topics and subject material. as well as the depth of the explanations, but with insufficient emphasis on application to reasonably transfer these concepts from academic to the real world."
16227,Wonderful course; quote interesting and insightful. Highly recommended!
16228,"I truly enjoyed this course to its' core. Or Are is an animated professor w/a gift for teaching to an engaged audience. I learned so very much during this course, some new and some confirmation of what I believed to be true. By experience w/Coursera is a positive one for certain and I am already enrolled in my next course. Thank you Or Are for sharing your knowledge and expertise in your study of dogs w/me. puff love, Alice"
16229,Really straight forward content and great overview of SQL + SQLite. Vice patron demon. Sometimes the instructor wanders a bit before he gets to his point.
16230,Very information and clear and the lectures are great!
16231,"Thank you Or Anger, thank you for the engaging first course which introduced me to the world of business data analyst and data scientist."
16232,The programming assignment really put the learning into practice. It's very practical and hands on.
16233,"I think the lectures were excellent, containing plenty of content and a periodic sprinkling of humour. I have programme in Python for a couple of years but this course taught me some neat technique I hadn't previously encountered. I hope I can cope with the next part and am looking forward to the chapter on regular expressions."
16234,"Awesome, Brilliant and Value added."
16235,"His was just a life-changing perspective-changing course for me. I have always loved Tolkien and have a background in literature and theatre. However I had always thought of LOTR as gene fiction and not ""serious"" literature. Studying it in the context of English Romantic quest narratives and poems changed my perspective. Beyond that, the world of online gazing was opened to me. I had viewed games from a distance with fascination but they missed my generation and so I had never dived in. Is a newby game over 60, it WAS a steep learning curve but I loved the challenge and the community I met in the game. Such a lively and nice bunch of people. I don't know what I did with my time before."
16236,a bit short :)
16237,"Excellent general course about the history of Lock in the Western World. Lots of names of musicians, companies, and music make the course seem to revolve around memorization. Even so, the professor does describe the historical element in logical chains of events and biographies.The quires could have been offered every week. There's no need to clump the quit material."
16238,His is a helpful course
16239,Great course. Learning Cava Data Structures and Either encryption was fun.Good material and problems
16240,"Awesome course. Professor is great at teaching, very down-to-earth and practical material. Good assignment. I wish to have more Path theory(as optional) in PCA & Optimization. Perhaps adding a job Interview section related to Machine Learning would be great"
16241,Awesome and brilliant. I learn a lot more than numbers the way off thinking
16242,Fool course for beginners like me!
16243,"I expected much more. The course material is really weak, did not improve my knowledge about Saber Security. I am very disappointed, also cos I played 30 dollars to a certificate. I do not recommend this course"
16244,Interesting Course
16245,"Great course! I very loved this class, although I'm a working game designer. It was useful and gave me much fun and some new knowledge! Thank you very much! I hope, this course will be continued with new materials and more practical tasks and peer assignment."
16246,"Of you plan to purchase this course, enjoy, but the course isn't really free.You can watch the lectures, but you must pay to clock the patron playground. There's no real point to the course if you can't test your knowledge."
16247,Great into to patron concepts!
16248,Very good and useful course with very deep supports !
16249,I think it would be better if the lectures can go a little bit deeper on the topics in this course.
16250,"Excellent course! I have learned a lot from this course, it's a wide knowledge very useful for every day.Thanks a lot for the high skill offered."
16251,"It is an interesting course. After taking this course, I can make use of Hands, jump in patron. In addition, I have learned some interesting knowledge about statistics. Thanks Prof. Christopher Brooks and was."
16252,Very good into to R programming
16253,A great course!
16254,"Professor Dinham's investigation and research based approach is great, and in my opinion much needed in the professional educational community worldwide. The material is presented thoroughly and the second piece of peer-assumed assignment is pretty well explained.However, I think the course material proposed in the outlines should be more diverse, by adding complementary video lectures, research articles and book extracts in every week, since this was proposed in this way just in fifth week; course 5 of the specialization program is a great example of that.The first piece of peer-possessed assignment may improve by being clearer and giving the opportunity to the learner to express his/her own ideas, instead of request a summary from this. Multiple Choice Questions should follow the principles exposed in the th course of the specialization program, which seems to not be done at all. Forms prompt should be shorter and clearer by highlighting a single key question instead of a bunch of these as happened."
16255,Awesome simple courses with an awseome teacher !
16256,"Great course! Basic into on how sports were, and are, looked at from a society point of view. Road information about many various subjects."
16257,"Actually, very interesting and helpful class. The one area around more complex structures (API, XML) warrants more attention, since I assume those are more dominant access methods."
16258,Trophic dressing is about relation between images and the space where they are. I think this course is a grate conductor which explains the main connexion and relationships of the components of an image.
16259,It was good thanks.
16260,excellent class for students to learn how to learn
16261,Only information. Not worth it outside the specialization.
16262,Good Into course!
16263,His course helped me a lot in preparing and thinking our family meals.
16264,I enjoyed studying history for the first time in my life. It is really insightful to see how design has evolved and still has influences from the past.
16265,"That a wonderful introduction to food and health, simplifies so well! I thoroughly enjoyed this course, as it presents the information with clear examples and helps us become more informed consumers for our own, as well as the environment's, benefits."
16266,"I hope received mortification as a of on email, and money be for hardcopy mortification , thanks Or))"
16267,"Super easy and practical way of leaning the basic data structures, and some other important of topics."
16268,It is a good course for any one interested in the field of oil & gas industry and all the processes associated with them.
16269,Great one!
16270,Awesome teacher
16271,Great course for a beginner!!
16272,Extremely good.
16273,His is a great course for those who want a business career.
16274,"really explicit and easy to follow up, nice preparation and nice content."
16275,"Good introduction into the material. It's great how rating other students' writers helps you penetrate the material yourself, especially since there are no right or wrong answers."
16276,great course
16277,"An't praise enough!His of THE COURSE for repression. Cannot believe I didn't stumble upon it earlier enough.Great Specialization, Great Course, Great Professors, Great thought provoking Quizzes and assignment, helpful senators and more important that any of the above, amazing comprehensive content covering each and every topic from simple linear repression to feature selection and going all the way to k Depression.In enjoyable and great learning experience.Hope to carry on the same level of enthusiasm through the rest of the specialization.Thank You Emily, Parlor, Than (enter) and rest of my classmates. And of course, Thank You Coursera."
16278,"I have being using Tableaux for the last 5 months. Though I could consider myself strong in visualization, it is clear after taking the first two weeks of this course that I was utterly poor in analysis. Thank you for this powerful course. Whether you are familiar with Tableaux or not, this is a course worthy all your time."
16279,It was very useful!Thank you!
16280,"His course was a big let-down compared to other courses in the specialization. It doesn't seem like a lot of effort went into course planning and creation. Such of the content is unclear and there is little depth. course textbook, and some will exercises would have helped."
16281,Great overview of the survey process. Instructor presented information in a concise manner. Highly recommended.
16282,The assignment are really aimed toward learning the course. It would be more exciting if optional assignment were more complicated.
16283,"The content of the course looked promising. But then I took a first look: the instructor is reading formula from a slide. His is missing the whole point of a online class. There is no motivation for the formula, no context why they are important. And from a learning point of view the course is very hard to follow. To real advantage compared to reading a book on that matter.I just took the ""Economics of Money and Banking course"", which is one of the best courses I ever attended (personally in class or online). There are other great courses on Coursera. And for easy introduction to some of the concepts Than University courses are snatched in accessability.Too bad that this course doesn't match up to the above examples. The topics would deserve that they are presented in a way that they can be understood by a wide audience."
16284,Great Introductory course for R.
16285,good course gives a basic foundation for data analysis ! Excellent for beginners who have no idea how to use expel for want to learn systematically expel files given at every lecture are very useful.
16286,"I REALLY love this course. I love learning new things all the time, and this course really helps with that. It puts new perspective in your mind and allows you to think further into things you may or may not have already known. Very interesting course, always mind grafting."
16287,"Very helpful, very met ( a course on how to take courses more efficiently)"
16288,"Really a well thought out course and expert delivered! I've never had such well explained lectures, using simple terms to explain complex subjects. Our professor is a master at education as well as her subject expertise. His is a great course, a little took at times, but just the right amount of took to make it more interesting and fun. Thanks for the obvious hard work in producing the course and time expended making it!"
16289,"Really great course, taught very concisely and in a way that is easy to follow."
16290,Among the very best MOOC courses ever!
16291,Excellent and Worthwhile. Feel like I got a good introduction to the subject and can now look at topics of interest to me more in depth from a good starting point. Some good and interesting applications in programming homework. Also helps learn Active (open source system similar to Atlas).
16292,The audit quality of the lectures could be better. Assignment need to be challenging. Programming assignment in Assembly should be used to evaluate the grade in addition to quires.
16293,"A gorgeous course. Difficult path made easy by the teacher. It's a luxury to do this course, thanks"
16294,Beautiful course!!Thanks Pale and Coursera!!
16295,Very good explain nd excellent material
16296,Great!!
16297,Great course!
16298,very beneficial
16299,Overall is great. The LDA and Dendrograms lack quality/specificity and depth of the previous topics. To sad the Specialization collapsed at 4 courses instead of 6.
16300,Great Course
16301,A completely new way to think about a negotiation.
16302,Brilliant!
16303,Very Good Course
16304,His course was amazing! I have never taken Python and feel like I have some grasp on the language.
16305,His is really an excellent course. The voices of the experience talking and teaching.
16306,"It was much more complete, diverse and time-consuming than expected. The quality of the teachings was unequal in my humble opinion. I found Or.German a bit stiff in his teaching and it was very hard for me to follow his classes. Other teachers were great though."
16307,I have been looking to get into finance for a long time now but couldn find something as flexible as this course. The concepts taught here are very simplifies and are easy to understand. Overall it has been very fruitful and i am looking forward to complete the specialization.
16308,His course is a wonderful introduction to machine learning applications
16309,good course
16310,Really useful
16311,"It is an excellent course for those who intend to know different design construct in cava. The course material, practice quires and tests are designed to help the student appreciate and be reasonably proficient in these aspects. By sincere gratitude to the professors and their team for this successful program."
16312,I wish there is a continuation
16313,good elementary course
16314,It is easy to learn and also good explained details about six sight data
16315,"I learnt a lot. The teachers could have been more engaged and interact with the students in turns, though."

16317,"very nice course, Thanks a lot for holding this and provide very useful materials in a easy-understanding manner!"
16318,Great teacher! Extremely interesting lessons. The teacher was able to explain very complicated aspects in physics to non specialists audience in an intriguing manner. Thank you!
16319,I've learnt a lot with this course. Sometimes we don't stop to think about how to think on making decision.
16320,His is a great course for people who do not know Ableton. The exercises were easy to understand.
16321,Excellent. It is easy to learn online with a teacher like Chuck. Thanks a lot.
16322,Basic information but well presented.
16323,"Oh lecturer could be a little more engaging and the materials used during classes, if made available would help following it better, by implicating the examples being shown."
16324,Moved it!
16325,"I love the way to teach the class. great team of teacher, great course. Thanks"
16326,"good tutor! good class structure! and the video, pick and experiments in the classes are really interesting!"
16327,Good presentation of the Same Theory with mathematical models. Interesting course!!!
16328,"His is an amazing class. It makes my professional life easy as well as my personal life. Everybody should take this class, and also the teachers are brilliant about all subjects that we see in class."
16329,a nice introduction
16330,"it was a good learning experience , course content is excellent"

16333,Great introduction to GIS using ArcGIS
16334,"interesting review of sinus and the acute/chronic conditions causing problems......dr quincy, adds"
16335,"It starts to get a little more technical and complicated when I reach Week 3. A lot of things about Dimension Reduction and K-means method. I would love to have some assignment or exercises on that.Other than that, I love this module."
16336,"Excellent course, just missed the mortification."
16337,Very interesting topic.
16338,"perfect lectures, as self-trainer, it helps me a lot. I have to say thanks Coursera,"
16339,I have always been nervous about coming by Or. S. made sure it wasn't scar at all. Very easygoing and fun to watch. I look forward to the other courses in this specialization.
16340,Awesome class! With Professor G as a gifted lecturer and detailed reading materials.
16341,Very good introduction to graphics design. Highly recommended.
16342,"A most powerful course for students, managers and those of us who are keen to continue to grow as wise and productive human being"
16343,A very interesting course and a good overview of Bootstrap. The teacher's style helps a lot to grab new concepts.
16344,"Very good good course for beginners, as an engineer I was able to understand everything:)"
16345,I like the way that this Course's brought to Students.
16346,I really enjoy this course. The lessons and homework were well designed. I hope a version of this course using Python.Thanks a lot.
16347,I learnt so much about addition and what it does to the brain...I wish I known this since I was a been. I have been sharing my learning with my family and friends and looking forward to helping my community in this aspect. Thank you ever so much for such valuable AND LIFE SAVING INFORMATION!
16348,"The two professors are amazing, very good course!"
16349,Short session need more hands exercise
16350,A great course. It took me out of my comfort zone of design ideas.
16351,Valuable not only for those who anna start without of's
16352,His course is exceptionally good for those who don't have programming background
16353,"Being from Real its really hard to get such course. I really enjoyed this course till now. The best part of this course is cheap hardware almost available everywhere........even in so called third world countries,"
16354,"The course was information, but seemed to be feared towards individuals not accustom to survival situations. I would enjoy taking a more advanced, in depth program.However, the course was clear and I enjoyed the assignment. Some of the quit questions were based off of information which may have meant more to the instructor than it was significant to the students."
16355,In introductory way to HTML 5...challenging assignment.
16356,"I enjoy this course, I recommended to anyone who wishes to improve or learn the art of selling! I would change the peer trading because you have to wait until someone grade your work. It would be better if the work is grade by the enter in my opinion."
16357,I loved the course
16358,I would have liked more guidance on the actual use of Lightroom for enhancing pictures.. all the slide controls on the right were covered much too fast for me!
16359,"The course is very well structures for a diverse range of earners. You could get a very deep knowledge and understanding through the reading (Greek tragedies, Herodotus, Thucydides etc) and the lectures, or a broad survey of the Ancient Greeks by just watching the video. The professor also combined the narrative, the methods used to study those narratives and the limits to our knowledge in an erudite yet engaging manner.Definitely recommended as a top quality resource for anyone who wants to learn about Ancient Greece."
16360,Great information course. A lot of practice gives the possibility to dive into Peter.
16361,I think there are only few contents.
16362,"1. Sometimes the audit of the recording is poor, making it difficult to listen.2. For non-speakers of Spanish, the translations are not so great and sometimes lack proper grammar or are almost literal translations of the spoken Spanish version. His makes the subject matter, although very interesting, very difficult to fully grasp. His also occurs in the quires, causing me to either misunderstand or not understand the questions.Overall, it is a very interesting course but the 'execution' is not up to standard. It could be improved by dating the audit recording, and correcting the translations for the subtitles"
16363,Good course for beginners who has no experience in programming. In introduction to patron and basic programming concepts. I think it is too easy for someone with a programming background.
16364,Excellent Into to the Social Media Marketing
16365,great introduction to my
16366,A really good foundation course for Machine Learning.
16367,"It is fun, it is useful, it is full of new knowledge (and I'm only on first week). It gives me inspiration and make me happy."
16368,"Vice course, well explained material that is address."
16369,Great course. I think everyone irrespective of their major should take this course.
16370,Very interesting et useful for daily work !
16371,Very Useful
16372,Great course. It's helping a lot.Thank you so much!
16373,"Of there hadn't been so many hiccups with the video and quires I would recommend this course. However, I lost a great deal of time viewing incomplete video and trying to complete quires covering material that was not addressed or only partially addressed in the video. When had to go back and Review all the video once they had been re-unloaded. It was a very frustration experience. I lost momentum and even motivation and as a result am now behind with the assignment and quires."
16374,The way of presenting topics of philosophy is refreshing and inviting for further reflection. The tests however are rousing on witty gritty differences or features in the presented video. Less motivation to submit the tests and invites me to focus only on the pressed video and excellent links to other extra sources.
16375,Great...
16376,too
16377,I like it very much! I have engineering background. I think differently than others a lot. His class provides me a different perspective.
16378,Love the professor and how detailed/information he is.
16379,Father elementary and slow-moving for my taste. But the material is competent presented and covers the material it is advertised to cover.
16380,"His was an excellent way to learn the basis of project management, clean, well-presented material."
16381,Awesome introductory course for beginners. Liked it very much.
16382,"The course is poor. Adams are too easy, video lessons are boring and not engaging. Content is poor too. Did not like the course."
16383,"Thank you for giving me excellent information on game theory. It is very helpful course for me. Thank you Stanford University,The University of British Columbia and Coursera."
16384,His course provides such a different perspective on the types of relationships we foster. I really do appreciate the interactive way in which the lecturer conveyed his material. I would definitely recommend this course to everyone whose willing to get out of the box!
16385,Very good to learn angular from the start
16386,Nobody has the idea how useful the course would be!!!It's Awesome...
16387,its a good course to get hands on development with machine learning algorithms. but one disadvantage being its using preparatory library
16388,"His course is very good for people who want to get some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. While it is not that long, it gives you practical experience and reaches you to do some practical things. I'd rather recommend it to people who already have some basic experience with web and programming (in any language), but the bar is not that high even for beginners. Nodule video and explanations are good and David Rossiter, who created the course, has my thanks and respect."
16389,"His course was a extremely introductory course in expel. I would not recommend it to anyone, especially at the cost of $95. Side from getting yourself thinking about using Expel and some minor lessons learned, I found it to be a complete waste of time."
16390,"West thing of this course is that it is self paced. To need to worry about submitting assignment or quizzez. However, this is also taking some some to get it completed."
16391,"Very good course, it help me clot."
16392,I really learned a lot and also that of is mostly A and not so I.Prof Andrew also reminded my programming skill.
16393,"The course was pretty cool. The professor is quite funny, I have to say, this series of study has been one of my most interesting experience, this course turned what seems to be mysterious physician's word and concept in to our everyday experience, and these wonderful experience plus a little computer edit then give you a complete new feeling of study that you can't have from ordinary schools. Thank you, Louis, it's a lovely course.."
16394,"Amazing, nothing less :)"
16395,Great course. I enjoyed a lot the practical part of it. Well done!
16396,Awesome course! Thanks!
16397,Great into to Python if you come from a non-programming background. Instructor is great and the materials are well produced and clearly explain the concepts and objects.
16398,Awesome Course !!
16399,Moved it! Hope a part two is in the making. Peter has great potential for fast high level development.
16400,of awful presentation but great instructor. I expected much more than this but :(Averaging employer brand is not complete :\
16401,well structures course
16402,Thank You!
16403,"Simply listening to somebody talk about the fundamentals of Agile, with no practical work whatsoever, could be an extremely boring experience. Thumbs up to the two people delivering the contents, because they both managed to do that in a very engaging way. Thanks!"
16404,"His is not a course for a beginner in programming. Of you are interested in learning R, I would recommend going to DataCamp and starting there. The lecture video were not engaging, and the jump from the lecture and quires to the programming assignment was quite significant (as others have pointed out). The lecturer for this course does have a pre-programming assignment on his GitHub depositors to aid in the first programming assignment, but this was not easy to locate nor advertised well (had to stroll through discussion forms before I saw someone mention it). The will assignment were the only saving grace for a class that was otherwise not engaging or structures well. The class could stand to be restructured: for example, it would have been nice for the lectures to cover the sir() function before our first programming assignment. Overall, this class does seem to be a good choice for a ""refreshed"" course if you already have some experience coming in R, but be wary if you have little to no programming experience."
16405,A fair approach to programming basis. A couple of funny video as well. Certain topics are a little bit over discussed. Liked the assignment although those could be a little bit more difficult to complete
16406,Great course to learn Internet of Things!
16407,There is a lot to learn and it is very interesting!!! The games are fun to play at home with your own dog.
16408,"For a person with absolutely not knowledge of programming its a very nice course to take. Its could be more widely explore the Biopython part, but reading the Biopython cookbook and the basis presented here its just perfect"
16409,"Really good course, their is a lot to learn."
16410,Great class by Professor Stay! I learned a lot and quick ago
16411,Extremely well designed course to introduce many practical aspects of machine learning.
16412,Easy to follow and information
16413,Thanks! It's a great course!
16414,"Another batch of interesting topics, but this time the laws are ... imperfect. There are are errors in the script, not difficult to troubleshoot and fix but still. Please review and correct them."
16415,The content of this course is very good to cover some greatest thinkers in human history. It is important to know them and their thoughts to understand the society and oneself. One thing could be improved is the exercises. They're repeating and fail to inspire me.
16416,Brilliant Course! Have me a new understanding of my cunning nine!
16417,Professor Meyer gave exemplary lectures while explaining a variety of different philosophical schools. I found the course interesting and enriching primarily due to the high quality of the lectures given by Professor Meyer. The questions during the lectures were helpful and the quires were short and effective in testing learning. May Professor Meyer live long and continue to teach!
16418,A perfect basic course for learning robotic.
16419,His is an excellent introductory course in the field of antimicrobial testing.
16420,"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coming. It times the code that were provided in the lecture video were out of date and a lot of time was spent on cooling to find the updated code. His is definitely not a beginner cover course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not code before."
16421,"Excellent course. A very good review for me. Having left material Engineering for some years and spending my time on hydrometallurgy, this was good material to review in catching up.Thank you for the class and hope to see more in this area. In excellent Professor."
16422,"Varied and well-explained that held my interest throughout. By only criticism is the English in some of the written quires, especially in the final exam, needs reviewing by native speaker as some of the answers are ambiguous when they do not properly explain the context of the situation."
16423,i like this course basically....i want to create html webpage so it is help full to create webpage thanking you
16424,Great course to help learn how to get through material that is difficult to understand.
16425,Fool course I love birds and now understand about them more !!!!! Plus I can tell my friends want to see a In look over there !
16426,Each me really something and offer ideas to overcome procrastinator.
16427,I am really satisfied with this course and feel like I have learned a lot enough about HTML to get started on other languages. The content and the teacher are really accessible and make it enjoyable to learn those new concepts. Looking forward to learning more!
16428,"Very good course, and tough too, you need good amount of efforts everyday."
16429,Great course and material. Well presented and practical!
16430,Fantastically organised and well-presented course.
16431,"Easy introduction to Python programming, encouraging"
16432,patient and systematic education is really attractive to student who hasn't much experience and concept in programming
16433,"Great course, will def be looking for more like this."
16434,really loved the course.
16435,"It was great course ,very clear and well explained too"
16436,His is a good refreshed on one's grammar and punctuation.It's an absolute summer that the quires are behind a paywall.
16437,"Great Expel course with clear content, detailed examples and instruction from profession firm"
16438,"It is more like a Unit course in the beginning or as far as i could watch. The methodology is not very precise and I could think in a few enhancements.Still, I could recommend for those who want just a initial contact with the method. To more than this."
16439,I was not able to complete this course for free. That was very disappointing! Universities like Stanford and John Hopkins find the opportunity to offer similar courses free of charge to people who want to learn. From University of Washington I have expected the same. Your bad!West regardsKonstantin
16440,Vice introduction to functional programming and learning how to think about problems in a different way. Earnings are not tied to just Scala - I also think I did not learn that much of the Scala santa during the course. I enjoyed the exercises and the course material was good which encourages me to continue on to the next course.
16441,It is not the best of ... but actually I was available to have some positive sentence about photography. Amazing
16442,A bunch of information condensed in small amount of time
16443,Sorry but he puts me to sleep. To emotion.
16444,Excellent flow.. starts little slow.. but good pace in the middle and end.
16445,It is a very information course for memory.
16446,Great course. Andrew G conveys concepts in one of the most articulate and elegant ways I have ever experienced with any teacher.
16447,Good introduction course to Python and programming
16448,A very good introduction about the different models.The only negative point is that it might be sometimes too theoretical.
16449,Excellent knowledge in very short time. Highly recommended course.
16450,Very excellent but we can't pass the exam if you are not pay.
16451,"Thank you, Air. Another great course material and wonderful explanation."
16452,His is awesome!
16453,Excellent introduction on how the international criminal court system works.
16454,"It is basic knowledge.However,it is useful to writing."
16455,"Huge gap between video and final assignment.Sides should be edited, we are not interested in trials and errors of the instructor."
16456,"would lastly prefer if this was taught using skin-learn and hands, given their broader use."
16457,His course was very helpful for the work I do.
16458,That a wonderful course to undertake. In my way to take all 10 courses :D
16459,A worthwhile of course. Would be shortened to 8 weeks.
16460,"His course is awesome. Of you really like the theme, you'll even want the course not to finish."
16461,a basic course of inference but i think perfect for this mood
16462,Good into to the topic
16463,Great course. Easy to follow and use the concepts in real world instantly. Course covers not only problem-solving but also change management.
16464,Excellent course for any beginner in machine learning.
16465,"Thank you Professor Uric and team to provide very interesting course where I have found new business models that are still infant in my country, then there is a lot opportunities to growth those models in my country. I especially love the case studies of Threadless, Of Printing. I would definitely recommend this course to everyone, especially students in developing countries where you can catch the opportunities in digital world."
16466,"Well presented, but this course should be optional in in the specialization. There isn't really enough material to justify it, but it does cover the basis for someone with little to no development experience."
16467,Good! But it's kind of easy.
16468,"The course is absolutely fantastic. The instructor and the team are well read, approaching topics from a variety of perspective. The course uses all kinds of texts and materials. Of you are into public law, history and social science, this will be great for you. Even if you are a reasonably advanced student, you will learn a lot, and if you are not - it's easy enough for a beginner to understand. Well done."
16469,Excellent! Is always with Have Dixon and his colleges! Impossible to improve!
16470,very good start to understand basis of clinical research and its statistics
16471,"Excellent course. You will study a very clear class about management, leadership and control."
16472,Very helpful. I learn a lot of useful tips and correct my previous bad learning habits.
16473,A clear and concise training of Data science. One example of Data science project would help to understand better. Thanks.
16474,"this course is well-organized although with the course going on i t goes more difficult, it is also a good challenge for us."
16475,"The course was very basic. It was nicely taught and the examples and the lectures were really enjoyable. However, some shortcomings I felt were that the colors in the sides could have been a bit clearer. Another thing was that some concepts were introduced in the lectures which were not explained completely. A real beginner would not be able to understand them which would in some parts defeat the purpose of the course.Other than that, I felt the course was really structures well. The assignment were easy and the quires did test the knowledge about the subject taught so far. It was such that any new person would not feel discouraged.Deep up the good job people."
16476,Rear course
16477,"Useful course. Interaction is not on par with in-person, but other than that the course is great. I should say, that I have already started getting the value from the key learning at my daily job and personal life. His is the best indication that the course was made right."
16478,"The course is very interesting,I like it. I was so happy when i got the certificate."
16479,Vice and Interesting start to get basis of Python Language.
16480,It's bittersweet reaching the last course in this specialization. I'm going to miss Or Chuck.
16481,"Great course, easy for whom already know how to program, but really great for the ones who are beginning programming! The next courses should be great too."
16482,"His course will help you to fall in love with AngularJS. Great explanation and exercise, assignment. Thank you very much."
16483,His course was very helpful. Would not be more grateful for the information.
16484,His course is very interesting and useful! Totally recommended for those who would like to review basic rules and gain some knowledge ;)
16485,"Really nice work, explaining macroeconomics in the context of evolution made it interesting and easy to understand. great work professor.Cried to understand the macroeconomics from the textbook, it was increasingly difficult until the context of evolution was not accompanied to the theories."
16486,Excellent lecture on neuron & synapses - building block of the brain.
16487,Provocative and engaging review of topics in human genetic. Requires some basic familiarity with biological principles. But well worth a personal investment in time and effort. Both lectures are fascinating. Only recommendation for improvement would be to present sources cited in the video elsewhere in the course materials. They roll by so quickly at the end of the video segments that it was impossible to review them adequately. Great course.
16488,Very good and to the point content. Very information
16489,The Professor is very slow and boring.
16490,Really enjoy the enthusiasm of the lectures. A couple of lectures run over the material a little quickly.
16491,Well taught Course !! Good Work Air. A Fig Thanks for helping me to understand the basis for Python programming very clearly.
16492,Thank Or. Chuck a lot.
16493,for novice teacher that's what they need
16494,I was hoping for something a little more scientific and a little less home-c-y.
16495,"Yakov does an excellent job with this course, really boiling down the difficult concepts behind Angular into digestive components. I like his approach of not only teaching Angular concepts, but also putting them in context of more broad design patterns (such as MVVM) and principles (such as unit testing). Great course overall, well done John Hopkins team!"
16496,"Very interesting course that gives basic information on a lot of topics related to finance and financial markets. Highly recommend for people interested in the topic with none or very little knowledge about it. The professor is not the best public speaker (paces around, use a lot of us, forgets his sentences and so on), but after the first few sections you get used to it and it is okay. But for one of the guest speakers, I think it was week 5, for me was very painful to hear him speak, so I ended up reading the transcribe, not listening to his speech."
16497,very good fully of information course
16498,Case study approach followed in this course is very use full and helps to understand the methods better.
16499,Very good introductory course to statistics and probability. His course is both entertaining and vigorous. I recommend this course without any hesitation to beginners and people who want to refresh their knowledge and skill in basic statistics.
16500,Finished
16501,Awesome course. The lectures are good and the lab portion is great. The lab really helps understanding how to use online tools and resources.
16502,Great!
16503,very helpful
16504,His course is pretty good.Algorithms' processing is clear in slide and teacher also explain well.I learned how to design API for data structure.I think it is important.
16505,short and sweet.
16506,Great course if you want to improve your skill to write
16507,"His class gave me a better understanding of expel and scratches the surface of excess capacity. I will never underestimate expel again. I appreciate the video, and other resources this class provides. I am business major and this class resented clot of the fundamentals."
16508,Very interesting!
16509,Quality stuff
16510,"I am highly disappointed with the policy of providing the homework only to the paid participants. It seems this is hearing towards another means of making business when it comes to education.I understand that trading and providing feedback requires effort and the fees charged is required to the cover those cost, but like before we must have an option to get access to the homework, allowing us to apply our learning while it maybe be acceptable not to have any feedback or certificate on the course completion.Currently, the closed homework policy goes against the basic objectives of MOOC and I hope it is reconsidered."
16511,"a little too slow, and a bit superficial on the difficult pieces. I would recommend to spend a little more time on the fundamentals, and a little less on the anecdotes."
16512,"His course was not a beginning level course as advertised.West cases for assignment were neither document nor otherwise explained within the course materials. Quizzes during the lecture were often unrelated to the material just presented or were given before the relevant material was taught.The course creator obviously put a lot of time and effort into this course. To it is difficult for me to write such a critical review. However, they missed the mark with this one enough that I can't recommend the course.Unfortunately I will not be completing this course only due to the fact that I have run out of time and patience to complete the last assignment."
16513,"homework assignment in matas are way too painfulthinking about if i should add x = 1 or not, X or X', how to sum over i,j,k, that was ok in 2010 but in 2016 there are tools that will spare us such details"
16514,"Great Course, I'd knoll over and over again. Thanks to our amazing professors"
16515,Some of the stuff is a bit overall but the instructor still manages to cover a lot of a material and he manages to explain it in a good manner. And then you just gutta love engineering. To other field would get away with talking about a bus full of slaves.
16516,Very good course. I knew some of the things in the course but I was careless about some others. Very information. I do recommend this course for people who never put too much consideration into personal finance before.
16517,"The biggest downside of the course is that instead of learning on open source machine learning nodules (learn) the course offers Dato's GraphLab, a proprietary piece of software that requires paid licenses to operate.To be clear, during the duration of the course students can use a student license that provides graphlab for free but this expired after a year. It seems like fine software but if you agent going to purchase a license after the class expired what the point? Also, Graphlab is built on top of python2.7. Of you are running patron 3.0+ on your machine you have to install a patron 2.7 instance.Otherwise the quality is solid. The philosophical approach the professors take is to give you a taste of a variety of machine learning models. The upside is that if you want to get a taste you can. The downside the course feels pretty shallow and then the next course in the specialization -- repression -- feels like a pretty stark contrast. In general it could be argued that this is a problem with all course courses. Now do you moderate course difficulty when you could be marketing students who are somewhere between high school kiss to computer scientists? To the course and the specialization tints between very easy and very hard."
16518,"It's a wonderful course, very helpful to my further study in neuroscience. Would be better if the nations of tutoring video do not have so many mistakes."
16519,"All of the course material and talk is available on Google documentation, didn't get to learn anything otherwise. Hero experience talk, no real scenario's/examples. Not worthy at all."
16520,With this course I've learned to improve my study habits and the technique it describes had been of much help at work where I have to deal with unpleasant tasks sometimes.
16521,"Each is doing valuable work and I like the premise of the course very much. The video seemed to present a lot of painfully obvious information, however, and I'm afraid they were not terribly engaging. Maybe just too much/too long? A shorter version of the course that digs in a little deeper somehow might be more alluring."
16522,"While this was one of the better courses I've done on Coursera, the start date of the course was changed without any indication of when it would begin. He've also been waiting months for the next course in the specialisation to begin, again without any communication. His was a good course, but I would recommend people wait until all the rest of the courses are available before starting this course and beginning the specialisation."
16523,Insightful and Grandson
16524,I took the initial offering of this course. It is an excellent class that I am sure will only improve over time. Prof. Muppala is a wonderful instructor and I learned so much in this course. By only suggestion would be to clarify some of the trading details as there were some questions on certain items in the last assignment. I would definitely recommend this series of courses and I am looking forward to taking the final course in this Full Tack Web Development series.
16525,"One of the best classes I have taken so far. Andrew of provides excellent intuition for the algorithms he covers. Machine learning technique like decision trees and resemble methods which are not covered here. I would also like to recommend that - it's not a beginner's course. Previous experience in linear algebra and programming experience is required, otherwise you'll get stuck. To prepare well and must do this course. Huge recommendation!"
16526,"Highly interesting and information course, it gives you a well balanced overview of the subject and act as a springboard to delve further into the study of the Universe and its marvels. Personally I really enjoyed professor Cockell's lessons, I found him amiable and his teaching clear.Of anything, I would say it is advisable to have a second source of information concerning space missions and science discoveries as some of these go back to 2013-2014, when the course was likely prepared."
16527,"One of the best courses, very useful material and the teacher was great !!!"
16528,"Awesome course, with awesome instructor and was. I spent a lot of time on it and learned a lot. Thank you for bring this course to me!"
16529,"In overview about machine learning. After finishing it, you can get some important structures about my.Deep learning."
16530,To complete and enriching. Well structures and organised.
16531,"For a student major in Literature, this video turns out to be very interesting and insightful, besides it is not too difficult."
16532,very good and useful.
16533,"Very funny and simple, I enjoy all video and homework"
16534,It is an excellent overview course of computational neuroscience and a wonderful introduction for beginners who want to join in computational neuroscience research.
16535,Very useful this course. Thanks
16536,Excellent course. Thank you a lot!
16537,Very good courses for machine learning! I've got a lot .

But after look the video over and over again, I feel better now. In China, I never witnessed a teacher jumping in front of the students, in front of the camera or in the livid classroom. To I really appreciate to see Or. German who show his passion in the field of study and teaching itself. I really love this course and the ""elephants"".Now I have less than 24 hours to finish the first assignment. Though many webster are forbid by the ""Great wall"", such as goose, I will do my best to finish the assignment which is the first English homework in my life."

16674,"Awesome course! By only critic is that I would have hoped to be challenged a little more. Although I do have rather extensive knowledge in programming prior to actually taking the course, just took it for a refreshed. It refreshed me wonderfully. The instructor was fantastic and I would recommend to another user. Thanks!"
16675,"Maybe, I am already somehow experienced, but I think that the time I spent on that was a waste :/"

16687,"I love the teacher so much! He can lead me to understand the mathematics problems which are really difficult to me. And he also taught some ""life experience"" by calculus: in terms of life curve, when you feel you are ""increasing"", which meaning f prime is less than 0, it's sad one way, but if the f prime prime is still greater than 0, you will recover again! To, keep moving~"
16688,"老师讲的很好，就是有些拖沓。实验部分希望老师在最后可以给出源码。A good course, good teacher, except that sometimes the teacher is kind of slow. And I do really hope that teacher could give us the final codes right after every exercise."

Him Fowler is crazy looking but he's very engaging, you want to share his haziness about calculus, and by the end of the course I found myself enjoying when new approaches come from previously learned.The only one slight minus for me was, that there is no medium complexity ""homework"". Rests and exercises are sometimes too easy and repetition. In the other side challenges given in lectures are too hard, and has no answers to check yourself ."

16706,easy and friendly to non-technical people (it's really for Everybody!) Thanks Prof for being so humorous and making the lessons interesting!
16707,The presentation of the course is a perfect example of how to engage students' focus and clearly present the subject one is teaching.

16745,Very interesting topics.
16746,I really liked to do it
16747,Very helpful in understanding the basis.
16748,"Fantastic course, for me the first one at Coursera and it was definitely more valuable than I expected. They not only give you insight of learning and several functions of the brain, they also give you concrete tools to use right away.I am sure all the things I have learned in this course are applicable for every one, despite age or background.Regards,Thomas"
16749,His course is superb!
16750,There are many interesting elements in the course but one of the coaches I can't connect to. I don't buy that coaches pitch as genuine.
16751,the course introduced me to different concepts about learning and it was overall quite interesting.
16752,In my case I listened to all courses as a refreshed of things that I learned in college about 25 years ago. It felt great to solve problems that I have not had a chance to do for a long time. I relived my college days in the process I gained a new insight that I can use in my current job as a of.
16753,"Course material was good. But, I was hoping the essay corrections and feedback will be given by experienced teachers/instructor, was disappointed at this as it was given by the fellow students!"

16760,"I loved this course, I read the Genius of Dogs and when I saw who the instructor was, I had to take it. Very information and engaging."
16761,His is one of the best teachers I've ever seen. He's engaging and information and he really knows his stuff. I took this as the free course (which means I am not grade) and am planning on paying for it the next time it is offered so I can do those grade assignment and find out how my work compares with my fellow students. Excellent course.
16762,Initially a little misunderstanding on the differentiation needed by the overseers of the course to relate to the diverse background of the participants. Formats and personal adaptations became more mutually understood and accepted. Course ended in strong accordance. The re-enactment and vignettes are excellent!! (and good--on purpose). His was the strongest component of the three so far.
16763,"I'of already finished this lesson. Frankly, it's simple and easy to understand."
16764,Excellent state up course for machine learning! Clearly explained what I need to know.
16765,"great course, like it the same way as the one on the macroeconomics."
16766,superb!!! Perfect strategics to learning and preparation to test.
16767,Overall felt it to be an excellent course. A refreshed in some areas and mind expanded in others. Was been decades since taxing my brain so. Had a few brother issues but it all worked out. Some of the prompt were interesting and quite a challenge. Compliments to the chess...
16768,His introduction is very well.
16769,"He aware that the beginning overview lectures of this course are radically different than the detailed lectures that come later.The beginning of this course should be sent to anyone that ever tells you that evolution is not a ""thing"": :after that, be prepared to do a lot of listening to Fig A little a and minutes about how genetic really works.His is a really good course.... not perfect, but really good. One star is removed because I think I would have preferred a bit more development and overview of the ""bigger picture"" (I fell asleep at times). I sometimes lost the concepts that I was interested in learning through the carriage of details, but for someone who is very seriously studying the subject, then it would be 5 stars.Prof Door is a good speaker: clear and has a nice voice and personality."
16770,Thanks for Awesome course. :)
16771,It's very helpful. I'm so luckily to meet this course.
16772,"His was really basic information. It's not really a 4 week course. It takes several hours. The into is necessary, but it's sufficient as a single week of content for a larger course."
16773,"Amazing course. Even though i knew many things in HTML5, i learnt many more. Eagerly waiting for ""Interactivity with javascript"" course to start"
16774,the professor nalebuff is a LEGEND
16775,Absolutely perfect
16776,I learned a lot thanks!
16777,One of the most thought provoking and important course any student could take. It is fundamental to almost all humanities and (especially) law. I give the highest possible recommendation.
16778,Really amazing overview of different approaches in of. I will highly recommend it for new in of.
16779,"I have not felt overwhelmed by information at any one point while taking the course, so it's a really great starting point for beginners."
16780,"I really liked this course. It was really fun. I learned a lot and I will put it to good use with my dog, Former. I also haven't got a chance to do Cognition so I will try to do it, It sounds so fun!"
16781,Thank you for reviving my interest in chemistry!
16782,It summarize views from different authority in the area. It takes 30 minutes to an hour to do the coursework. It's highly participatory.
16783,"great course , learned a lot and understood all my mistakes."
16784,His course guides earners of various proficient very well. Have was very thorough and methodical in his approach. Assignment are of moderate competence to complete with out any difficulties.
16785,In absolutely information and thoughtfully developed course that is easily understandable by persons with little or no legal training. I have a much greater understanding of the police power of the state vs. the power of eminent domain.Thank you.
16786,"Very well presented course, but in my view could be somewhat more to the point. Nevertheless, congratulations for a job well done."
16787,It was a very interesting course especially for those who are not English native speakers. I learned a lot.
16788,"His course is a little bit difficult to get started with if you do not have any code experience. However, it is a really great course because the content is sufficient but not too much and the course is clear enough. The last two assignment are tough for me and they took me a long time to figure out, also I read a number of materials about Scala functions on Internet. His is the first course that I finished and I really like this course."
16789,"By review: 75%. It's a big picture course. Despite not so deep, it's sometimes a bit confusing, because the topics are apparently uncorrelated. Maybe in fact I couldn't catch it..."
16790,"Late this class, I wasted 200 bucks on this cap and now I am stuck taking it..."
16791,Or Chuck is amazing! Enjoyed every second of the course!
16792,After ending all weeks and made all task I clearly see the agile path. I know - what direction I should chose and what I should do during the road.
16793,Excellent course to understand a little bit more about the history of Middle Last
16794,Amazing course! Each module was very well constructed and the supporting material was very interesting and professional.
16795,very useful for mechanical engineers
16796,"His course started very easy but ending slightly challenging so it was a perfect introduction to Python as well as general programming for me. By background is limited to writing lots and lots of SQL but always on the analysis side, not on the infrastructure side. Looking forward to continuing the specialization!"
16797,Outstanding course for anyone interested in game design.
16798,The Assignment are more of Trial and Error and not very helpful. The Course Material and Content is good. Reaching Staff is nowhere to be found.
16799,The course is almost about nothing. It seems to me that the teacher didn't make enough preparations and make a lot of mistakes during the house. After 8 weeks of Arduino-related courses I've got almost nothing new besides first 2 chapters of Arduino Started It book.
16800,Great introduction course on HTML5. Perfect for those who have no prior experience and want to get things rolling.
16801,"It's very good, help me a lot."
16802,Great course.Houses on the fundamentals and the practice part more. It helps you get a flair for of.
16803,"Thanks, fatty! :)-She"
16804,Interesting explanation of learning organizations applied to logistics. I enjoyed.
16805,"Interesting, ""agile"" and complete. The quires are of a good level."
16806,The course is very well organized covering a lot of topics. The assignment are mapped well with the course content and help to understand the system development well. Professor fig is very clear in his explanations and makes you feel very comfortable even with the difficult concepts.I highly recommend this course if you plan to learn machine learning using open source tools and practical examples.
16807,Absolutely loved the way Emily tackled the course content - the knowledge I gained regarding LASSO & lodge was something even I wasn't expecting. Also the optional video helped a lot to understand the mathematics better as compared to a mechanical write-down of the steps
16808,In our age of exponential change continuous education is becoming an essential part of life. His course provides a vital set of learning technique that can be applied to any pursuit or career. Highly recommended!!
16809,"His is the best course for Angular. Yakov is really great teacher, he knows Angular and knows how to explain it. He tries to make us understand how angular works behind the scenes."
16810,"Thank you course for the studies, it was all a great experience."
16811,A very nice course!
16812,The best way of marketing research
16813,"Beautiful and it reminds me of ""life is a learning""!"
16814,"Such an interesting course, would definitely recommend."
16815,Very nice and helpful.
16816,"Super-super, very useful!"
16817,Great course!! It's really useful.
16818,I am sad to be coming to the end of this specialization. I have learned so much and don't want it to end.
16819,Completed the first week of this course and I am very pleased with the instructor and the flow of teaching. Everything is explained clearly and simply which makes it easy for me to grasp the concepts. Pollen also makes it a point to tell students to actually play around with the code in order to see what it does and help make lectures easier to understand.
16820,Love this course. To interesting and so challenging.I like the way it's given and passion of Or. Fowler motives so much
16821,"A really useful course. It helped me to organize my everyday life, it even have changed my philosophy of life - each minute is important!"
16822,Interesting and information course for design of cling
16823,Thanks a lot to Or Like An and Or An Faulconbridge for this excellent MOOC.
16824,"A lot of material to memories, but very good information not only on how to influence others, but on keeping others from influencing you in a negative manner and turning their tactics back on them.His is also a great course if you are into politics and news media/advertising/marketing.You will really learn a lot and the speakers have good voices, fast paced, good video and dialogue that will not bore you as in other lectures."
16825,I like the assignment
16826,"Compared to other courses in the creative writing specialization, I felt that this one needs some improvement. The video lectures just didn't have enough meat to them. For example, in other courses in the specialization, there will be links to optional reading or video, leading to a deeper understanding of the concepts. Some reading, for example, would be welcome to give example of great (or even not so great) characterization."
16827,Very interesting and useful course. Really enjoyed it. Thanks!!!
16828,Simple and important concepts that everyone should know. Took this self paced course and understood all the video. I wish the course could have more information on Finance which is useful for entrepreneurs.
16829,I really enjoyed all of the data visualization technique and packages that were covered in this course.
16830,"His is an excellent course, though all of the topics were those that i had studied before but the way they explained it made so much sense and refreshed my knowledge."
16831,"Overall, a good overview for Hadoop, Mapreduce and big data concepts"
16832,It does what it says
16833,His is an amazing class for learning Machine Learning. I think I have learnt everything basis about machine learning and be able to apply it in real problem now. It should be the first course for everyone want to learn Machine Learning. Thank you very much Andrew G for such great course. I wish I have started to study this class earlier.
16834,"Very topical and extremely interesting. The professors were great. His course should be experienced by any American that wishes to be informed about the creation of the State of Israel. Nicely done. Thank you, Coursera, and thank you, El Iv University."
16835,"good quality, easy to understand, entertaining, I would recommend it to everybody :)"
16836,Must course. Should be done before taking any subject or learning new skill.
16837,Perfect course!
16838,good course to start learning cava with OOPS
16839,Good material but short explanation and no detail exercises and solution practices before the final test makes the test a bite hard to resolve.
16840,"I'd rather have assignment for which you really need to change/write code, not just run existing one. Otherwise the course by itself is great."
16841,"In my opinion the course was fantastic!! Very easy language, clear explanations and an excellent and nowadays topic: ""Good and Health""I love the video from May Dam!Andre AguiarBrazil"
16842,"Excellent course content, well presented enjoyed it thoroughly !!"
16843,His is a great course for this specialization but don't expect much depth.
16844,His course provides a wonderful glimpse into the world of plant biology and is delivered in a very unapproachable way by a clearly passionate speaker.
16845,Great teacher. With some issues. I found a little bit confusing the first week installing instructions with lots of data. But it improves.Exercises are surprisingly elegant. Not easy but once you with the functional way of doing it simple.
16846,"Great teaching and comprehensive, clear presentation of concepts related to the topic. I have acquired a deeper understanding of brand and product management theories, models, framework and concepts at a higher (more micro) and more strategic level that is very applicable to the real world. The professor is very engaging and I like his use of real-life examples (through his work experiences, etc) to make the course material very relevant. Hopefully this helps in my headstart in my career switch!"
16847,information. Met it was tedious and repetition I already learned this stuff in college.
16848,Great reinforcement of vital learning technique.
16849,Very easy to jump in for someone who has never programme before. A little slow for people who have experience.
16850,Instruction from its father.. such a fabulous course!!
16851,"His is a really good into course. It's not pitched at a terribly high level of difficult, but it does give you a fair amount of practice. I'm really pleased with it."
16852,"Update:Coursera or the course content provider has changed this course in a bad way: You have to PAY for the course of FULL AMOUNT JUST to get your assignment submitted and reviewed by peer learner.That a pity.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great course! Material is very useful and interesting!The course introduces concepts in a progressive and comprehensive way so that knowledge is easy to be understood. Practise quit and assignment perfectly reflect course materials.Also, professor Muppala is quite funny. Enjoy the course!"
16853,"It would be very useful for teachers, teacher-trainer etc. They must go for this course."
16854,Great!!
16855,"His is an excellent course with clear, concise easy to understand presentations, filled with useful tips on how to improve the learning process. Highly recommend it to anybody at any stage of life, as learning never stops."
16856,"Great course, I liked the way each lecture is presented (general overview of each concept; academic insight; practical recommendations) and having a deep and thorough look at how ""digital"" is impaction ""marketing"" is so important that is usually overlooked. People just move to specific merits and practices, but such a revolutionizing way of dealing with marketing deserves this broad and deep look so one can fully comprehend what is going on."
16857,"It was overview of things that one does using of. The instructor focused just on the concepts, leaving the internal working on algorithms and that helps someone is very new to this field to first get a broader picture"
16858,"The course is great. Although it is really fast and requires some advanced understanding of algebra and statistics, it is not bad. However, I would recommend to expand it and to include the advances in non-manipulation causation, as sustained by proof. J. Pearl and F. Squazzoni (specifically talking about sociology)."
16859,"Very good content, oo long, too many words to get to the point, and too many instructions on assignment."
16860,Excellent course for getting started with patron. To programming background is needed!
16861,"Vice overview of Galaxy, but does not really provide enough information for a beginner to start using it without additional resources."
16862,"A good course. Very basic, but that's to be expected for an overview course."
16863,"That was a pretty good introduction on how various systems work, together with a nice practical tutoring. However, the delivery has ENORMOUS potential for improvement... for now it's just sides with an extremely impassive voiceover. There are so many good ways to engage with the learner and yet none of them have been employed here. After doing a great Deep Learning course by Google on another platform, this one was a huge disappointment in that regard."
16864,The course is well-structures and useful. Thank you.
16865,"The teaching process is very elusive and subtle. The explanations in this course are very unclear and tricky, even some of them are omitted, which makes this course very hard to understand.His course seriously lacks of logic. It's more like a heap of formula thrown together and what the teacher do in this course is just to read them."
16866,"His course gives a very good overview of algorithms, justifying each new data structure or technique by examining the performance and technical problems that it is trying to solve, and explaining the meaning of the approach. It is a good idea to do a good bit of coming on your own, however, as the Assignment typically expect you to USE the data structures explained in the lectures from a static library rather than hand-code."
16867,"I think it's a really good opportunity to be able to obtain a TESOL certificate online and this course seems to be able to do it very efficiently. However, I have found the approach of the style of the lessons a little bit slow and too dramatic- and somewhat even childish. I'm sure the planning of this certificate program is to ensure that people who take it will remember it so that they can really make use of it in their profession- so they probably avoided long and boring lectures. But still, I must admit that the lessons look a little bit annoying sometimes :) Still, thank you for the opportunity."
16868,Communication and Active listening is so very crucial.
16869,"I loved this course, it allowed me to get more opportunities in my work field, I highly recommend it."
16870,"Excellent Course, but is not for beginners.Excellent Professor too."
16871,"His class felt a bit elementary . . . but it had some good material as well. I would appreciate a bit less operating and goodness (which actually praised in the course) and have a bit more academic material. In one of the video, the professor suggested that teaching should be slightly above the student's level but not too high. His course seemed to be a bit lower than my level (but I have taken education courses in the past)."
16872,Great course!
16873,Perfect course again. Run and challenging at the same time.
16874,"His course very amazing, give knowledge about how to become a leader,and professor light l thompson very amazing!"
16875,I am so glad I took this course! I have learnt what I consider very important aspects of virtual teaching such as identifying at-rise students or building a community with the students that engaged them in the learning. I have also had to learn how to produce a video for the students which I will use for my online course and I have also become aware of the importance of the QFT for deepening the learning of my students. Thank you so much Chris!
16876,the best
16877,i like it. simply and clear about time management and productivity. thanks!
16878,One of the best course I had till now. BEST!

16890,A great into course.
16891,His course goes straightforward to what matters.
16892,"It first I wondered how could there be so much to know about rehearsing resembles. All into except a bit is valid for all resembles from a rock group to orchestra. Or Van Feldman is a pleasure as an instructor as he has passion, a good delivery and lots of experience and knowledge. I liked the actual rehearsal video as he put to practice the technique, I only wished we could have seen the same in the chloral and orchestra segments as opposed to just a dialogue with the also very knowledgeable conductors. His was professionally done and the into is so very important. I took the course as I am part of several resembles but recently joined a university orchestra and this opened my eyes up to the process which had seemed had hazard but clearly was not, Sacro - micro, pleasing work, intonation,sectional work etc all have their place during the rehearsal."
16893,Very boring presentation of the material
16894,Too much focus on technicalities - not management based.
16895,Great course with quality instruction for introduction to the material.
16896,Very insightful.

16904,There should be some case study to feel real time scenario. Is far as the content is concern its perfect.Thanks
16905,A great course. Subject is presented in a very elegant and formal way by professor G starting with basic things and advancing with perfect pace to more difficult things. I appreciated the focus on real life work of of such as evaluation statistical models and optimizing tearworn effort and time.The only problem I found is the quality of audit recording: in a noisy room could be difficult to understand prof. G words for a non english speaker.
16906,"That's a good course. A little bit repetition if you have already studied about MKT. But it presents new concepts, interesting cases and give you some updated about what is happening in the market regarding the Was."
16907,His course is awesome and really understandable for Economics students
16908,Great
16909,The Teradata part is quite challenging and I think it would be better if there are more hints. I like the SQL part more.

16911,GREAT CLASS
16912,"Excellent course that improved my approach to learning.

16921,It is really hard fun to make games and I am blessed to have this specialization course!
16922,Great course.
16923,"I really liked this course. Although some of it depended too much on pre-made script it was at the level of games that make sense to a beginner without being to complex (like all of Unity's own tutorials are). Sometimes, it went to fast and I was quickly twitching from Unity to Coursera to hit the ""pause"" button to give me time to catch up. I thought that it took way to long to download other participants work in order to evaluate it, but I think that is an issue with Coursera and not with this course."
16924,way too many peer reviewed assignment.

16973,"Having done some other machine learning MOOCS , this course seemed rather basic to me and did not enjoy too much using non open-source software for the programming assignment. The material is nice, In this sense, I would have expected to 'default' to si-kit learn and offer using graphlab create as optional."
16974,It's a mandatory limestone for software management education.
16975,Or.chuck is the most awesome teacher! this course make everything related to Python and web so clear.

16998,"Feels like there is an extreme discontent from the tutorials/lectures and the programming assignment. The programming assignment, were at times, rather difficult and had little to do with the lectures from that week. Overall I feel like I have a decent base in R, however I still feel like a lot of concepts were lost/not explained thoroughly enough."
16999,Nicely target for the programme needing a jump start into Android while having a good base in Cava.
17000,"the Pollen van Went, pad to this course"
17001,A must do course for anyone venturing into the Machine Learning world.
17002,It provides me with exercises to practice but some of the video explain things awfully or just not at all. Others are good. The discussion boards are helpful. I just wish they didn't talk as much about what something is as opposed to how it works. Any video often don't show any code or very little which makes understand santa difficult.
17003,"The course covers an extensive important period of time and in a very organized way. You never get lost. The quires are of remarkable level, very well-thought and never superficial. The way things get related and start making sense helped me get to another level in my knowledge of history. I will never study any subject without making reference to other important events that happened elsewhere. And will always refer my reading on this theme to what I learned in this course. Great chance to watch Professor Zelikow's classes from Brazil. Thanks Coursera!"
17004,Good Course!
17005,"good advice, nicely given, easy to follow"
17006,"The course is very interesting. The explanations are clear, exercises are very useful to apply and understand better what is explained in the class. I really recommend this course to anybody who wants a good introduction to machine learning."
17007,Vice introduction to common tools in the area of data science.
17008,I really enjoyed the problems. I would strongly advise to solve them all.
17009,"All the basis - and much of the advanced stuff - is presented, in a coherent and inspired way. Thanks for grafting such a course."
17010,I very much enjoyed the information contained in the course - however I did find that it was difficult to apply some of the very glanced bases to the financial problems posed in the quit when many of the bases were used in examples outside of the stock market in the course reading leading up to the quit. I really wish there were more examples for each bias (and more from the world of finance) because some bases were really hard to distinguish from one another. In one hand I did like that I wasn't spoon fed the information for the quires but on the other I don't feel as though I was fully equipped to answer some of the quit questions due to the way the information had been presented.The information built on itself so I found myself going back to week 1 information and week 2 information in week three.
17011,His course was very helpful to me as a teacher. I can identify a child with dyslexia and help him\her in reading and writing. I am also very grateful to Vincent and Penny (our facilitators) for motivation the participants for their active involvement. I want to know the way to get the certificate for the course done. Your help on the above will be highly appreciated.RegardsMuskan
17012,"Good information contained within the course which has spared my interest in continuing to learn and build on my small amount of knowledge. Power rating than I would usually give for a course because of the way the lectures are delivered. Having a lecturer standing in front of a brick wall, plugging his book and not really connecting with online students was not great. A couple of times during the lectures I dozed off and had to re-run them. Of the plugging of own material was removed and the background and tone of voice were altered this could be a captivating and interesting course."
17013,"I have experience with scraping, so most of the concepts weren't new to me. That I valued here was the Python-particular gotchas, such as inventing and adding colony to if statements."
17014,Well refined lectures and wonderful resources.
17015,"Excellent course, easy to understand. may give you a few headache if you don't have the correct ArcMap Version but"
17016,Great course!
17017,very essential
17018,Vice and interactive course.Even takes subjective tests and helps get reviews from peers which is very constructive for a learner.
17019,"His course makes us re-think things that we take for granted. I was shocked in the beginning on how we ignore practices that should be the basis of any research. Is the course progress, I learned new concepts what is essential to our self development."
17020,"Very good, but after all the hard work one should be able to pursue a paid certificate at least"
17021,"His course help me to understand what is missing part of change!!! Very, very useful. ....and most important - this conception works. Any thanks to authors!!!"
17022,A very good course that makes you think.
17023,I learned quite a few new themes. His is a great class.
17024,"really interesting, many tools to keep going with this topic"
17025,A very helpful course in understanding how the team composition should be and the typical Mob descriptions of different members of the team.
17026,Thank you! Really fantastic course!
17027,"Overall course is really good.But I would be much more happy if he covers deep learning or creates other courses on specific topic like deep learning, recommendation system."
17028,Excellent course. You can learn a lot even if you are not a master in Baths.
17029,"Gives pp good intuition of machine learning,"
17030,Really the best!!! But It will be good if lecture includes some errors we can make and silly mistakes which affects results adverse. Jogesh sir is very good teacher and he is clear and brief in less time
17031,"Liked it very much. The exercises, however, could be better explained in some parts"
17032,"Really great course. A couple of issues with missing lectures and problems with quires, but the quality and death of the content more than makes up for it. Fascinating and inspiring."
17033,"Great introduction for people who eat a lot of processes foods and would like to change it. I liked the simple language, rather than difficult breakdown of chemical compounds and processes that I encountered in different course. I believe this will help many people understand the reason why they feel bad in a simple, understandable way. I cook at home every day. For me it's the best way how to stay healthy and know what's in my food. His course was right on track with my believes and I greatly enjoyed it! Thank you so much!"
17034,Really enjoyed this course and the people who participated. Thank you.
17035,Great course!
17036,Or. Charles Severance is an awesome online teacher.Learning Python this way is easy and fun and the same time.Thank you so much for this course.
17037,Really useful for learning Bootstrap basis!
17038,Easy to understand. Very useful for very beginners to programming. Thanks.
17039,very creative
17040,A very good for beginners.
17041,Great course!!!!
17042,"Not bad, I knew some tips from this course, it was rather brief and information, but didn't contain full information of resume writhing. To after finishing the course I can only orient on the samples given and on separate lifehacks, but not making my resume by steps.Still almost perfect"
17043,Excellent course. I really recommend it for everyone. And I actually think is a topic that should be taught in every school.
17044,"A very complete course, very interesting!"
17045,Great Course! Well taught and very clearly explained. I was doing a Computer Science Course after almost 25 years and felt completely at home!
17046,"Very nice and interesting!I learnt a lot. I wish I could make better use of discussion forms. Some questions and few concepts remained unanswered/ not clear, however it was a fantastic experience overall."
17047,"I have to admit, that most of the video confused more than they helped. For most of the topics I simply went to KhanAcademy and got it easily there and I was asking myself, why a topic was made so complicated. I have the same issue with the next course. I highly recommend to start visual explanations of what you want to achieve instead of throwing formula at people and confuse them. of KhanAcademy e.g. they do exactly this and you got the point and if you got the point, the formula wasn't such a big thing anymore."
17048,"A fun journey through the history and structure of the internet. His is a thorough but brief introduction. Well worth your time to check out if you're interested in history, technology, programming or just finding out something new. The diversity of interviews is impressive, although there is overlap with Or. Chuck's other courses."
17049,West for clarity. Interesting content too.
17050,Very interesting courses and extremely useful after take G's courses.
17051,a great course for beginners. college is a great teacher and the homework projects are cool.
17052,The instructions for using git and git hut left a lot to be desired.
17053,cool
17054,"To know more about the wonders of Python Language and its related concepts in the web world, this is the course that one can take. Thanks to all who made this specialization available to us :-)"
17055,wish i had a prof like him
17056,Help me a lot in understanding some difficult concepts.
17057,I've taken several music courses on Coursera and Introduction to Classical Music was my favorite.
17058,"His course is not very ""beginner friendly"""
17059,"His course is good in providing students tips for effective learning. Students are better in how to learn, however, it could be better if more cases, especially students with learning difficulties, are provided to illustrate how learning tips solve problems."
17060,"Although I am not a native speaker,but I try me best to understand it!Good teacher!Good Coursera!"
17061,The Course is simple yet information. Sometimes we ignore very simple yet strong concepts. His course is very good for beginners. Also useful for those who wish to brush up their concepts.
17062,"Fantastic course. One should make it mandatory to all university professors and would be great for high students and first year university students. I am planning on integrating it into my teaching and presenting some of the ideas and technique discussed in the course to my students on each class.I have tried a few other courses on Coursera and this course seems truly exceptional: the way the material is structures, presented and you can really feel the enthusiasm of the course instructor.Thank you very much."
17063,"His was my first course on course and I very much enjoyed it. It is very well structures, Andrew explained each topic in a very intuition way, and I feel like I have a very good idea now of what machine learning actually is and how I can apply it to real world problems. However, the coming exercises tend to be a little bit too demanding (at least at the beginning) if you only have little experience with Active's programming language and if you are not trained in econometrics/statistics. More (optional) coming examples might be helpful at the beginning. Nevertheless, this is a great course and I would recommend it to anybody interested in machine learning! Thank you, Andrew."
17064,great start using Python
17065,Short and easy.
17066,I found this course incredibly useful and practical. It has not only helped me better understand the process of learning but it has also given me valuable tools in how to optimism my learning process.
17067,"I love this course. Although it contains many basic ideas and fundamental lessons, all are stated, and explained very well. Without understanding those things, it's difficult to gain a keen insight as well as further research on Machine Learning. Thank you instructor, and Coursera team for running this course regularly. And not forget to mentioned Prof. Andrew G. for his great contribution to our community."
17068,Excellent and advanced applications. Thanks a lot!
17069,Great
17070,"While the efforts of the coursemakers are greatly appreciated, much could be done to refine the quality of the course. Any materials have broken links and the lack of character entry for some practice problems poses an issue as ilyin with tones is rather hard to type."
17071,information video. useful final project
17072,Great R started!
17073,"Contents of the course are very diverse, clearly changes your way and ability to identify patterns, and fit real world in to models to extract additional information ...It does not have a very in depth, description about most models, but enough to understand them, because there are so many different concepts that are fit together ...Its an excellent introductory course to models."
17074,Really good introductory course on of technologies.
17075,"I've learned a lot of how to build a programs in object-tormented language. Thanks a lot, it is the best course I've attended."
17076,Great class and really love it
17077,Great Lesson that offers me implementable knowledge
17078,Very thorough renown on the aspects of MATLAB. The instructor was very insightful and detailed.
17079,Extremely helpful and information. The benefits of this course is going to stay with me for the rest of my life.
17080,"Great course, I feel ready to develop some apes now."
17081,I enjoyed this course very much. It was easy to breeze through and very information. It definitely made me a better writer as I became more aware of very common mistakes that I make.
17082,"Of you have some background programming in another language, and some familiarity with HTML/CSS, this course does a fantastic job introducing both Ruby and Nails. The first week walks you through machine and environment set, the second walks through the basis of the Ruby programming language, and the third walks through using the Nails framework to develop simple webster in Ruby. All the lessons are laid out clearly with solid examples.That said, this is not a beginner course. It really only spends a week covering how to program in Ruby, and Ruby has some quires that make it a challenging first language. Of you're brand new to programming, do yourself a favor and take an introductory course first."
17083,"Good Course ,Good content for Bootstrap."
17084,"I found our instructor to be effective, and this course to be well taught and administered. The instructions material was an excellent preparation for the assessment, which made it a guide and model in addition to being a good course.Of six stars were statistical permissible, I would have given six stars."
17085,"His is my second course. A very good teacher, resources, and explanations."
17086,"His is a good course, I would just do some things a little differently, for example, I don't agree with weighing oneself daily."
17087,His is a great into to a range of topics in machine learning. I do recommend pursuing the entire specialization since this course only scratches the surface of each topic.
17088,Lots of good tips and reminders one may have forgotten in this busy lifestyle most of us live.
17089,"Met me heartily thank authors for the course. It was interesting and useful, and definitely I will use knowledge and experience from this course in my own practice."
17090,Well organized. Well presented
17091,His is a good started for setting and framing your copyright policies if you work with Multimedia.
17092,Round a lot of interesting and important information for me here. Excellent information on making prognosis tied with accounting and financial reports
17093,"Any thanks to this program, and I have confidence to take next step of writing."
17094,Very useful to make your leaning time more efficient.
17095,interesting and fun
17096,"Good course. His course is quite challenging for people who don't major in path or physics. However, it isn't so difficult to understand as the post half of this course has a lot in common. In my experience, understanding the concept of prior and posterior estimation is the core of this course. Have fun learning this course."
17097,"Thank you very much for this course, i have a hospitality background and always wanted to learn about luxury companies and this course definitely helped! Great job!"
17098,Thank you :)
17099,Easy into to basic structures in patron. Some exposure on advanced structures such as Counters would be useful too
17100,"Excellent class. Video lectures are very accessible and good content.The automatic parker is a pain, and can be improved. I spent a lot of time to get code that was working and giving the correct output to pass the tests."
17101,The assignment doesn't correspond with the content of classes closely.
17102,Excellent for a beginner!! Professor Severance follows a very smooth and efficient method of teaching that reduces anxiety and increases passion for learning!! Recommended to anyone starting Python!!!
17103,Must give it a try!
17104,It give me a new way of science analysis to know the business better
17105,Very helpful
17106,You will thank yourself for taking this course up. Assignment in this course are very well designed to give you a real experience. You have the best faulty here.
17107,I really enjoyed this course. It was very thorough and I felt like I got a good grasp on the basis of GIS which was really helpful for the future courses. Definitely a great course to take if you are looking to master the basis of GIS.
17108,"It is an awesome course, a must have if you want to get the idea how to develop and plan your software or design idea."
17109,Exceptional course content. Very creative way to make students learn.
17110,His course covered every detail that a started entrepreneur must take into account when launching an enterprise: from the naming of the brand and the pitch approach to the legal aspects in intellectual property. I have found interesting and important information that will surely help me save time in future planning.
17111,"It was a decent but definitely surface-level introduction to the concepts surrounding Web Pp development. A wealth of vocabulary is defined. There's just too much material to cover in one class to understand any one concept deeply. However, a broad array of basic concepts are introduced and I benefited from taking the class."
17112,His is a great course and I learned so much and now I feel like I can talk more intelligently about religion with my Buddhist friends.
17113,It wasn't Exactly what I'd expected but was still a good course.
17114,nice class!
17115,Challenging but fun!
17116,I can't start this course
17117,very useful and interesting as well
17118,His is a very useful class.
17119,"Great information on how to improve negotiation skill, as well as some valuable strategics. Presented in a professional and light-hearted manner. The recommended book isn't necessary, as the material is gone over in the lectures, but is still handy."
17120,Part of Neutral net could be better explained
17121,I knew R and was looking for an into to Python. Of you already know some programming this class is too basic.
17122,Very good and interesting course. I really recommend it.
17123,"Some of the information from video to video was repetition. However, I learned a lot about how organic food is good for people and the environment. Additionally, it was great to see how children can get involved in the kitchen and i hope that any parents who watch this try to get their children to be involved with a small garden or helping to prepare meals. Hands-on is the best way for kiss to learn!"
17124,Excellent course well suited for beginners but raising their level fast
17125,"Amazing. To much useful information, so well structures and presented and also keeping a young and happy spirit throughout the materials. (you will understand what I mean)His course is a really life changes and any person should take this. I warmly recommend to watch also the optional video to learn from real life examples.Good luck and enjoy!"
17126,I enjoyed the pace of this course and the constructive feedback I received from fellow students.
17127,Really good introduction course on Machine Learning. Andrew G is a great instructor !
17128,this course was very interesting and fun. It's unbelievable how dogs are amazing and how we just took them for granted and didn't even know!! Lucky you you came to the right place; Or Are will teach you all that. this course is really well made and will teach you a lot about the basis and way more. I highly recommend it.
17129,"The best thing, just after the course when I see the stars to rate the course of algorithm goes in my mind (The). Super awesome course, right from the basis to deeper. Sides and topics are split in right pieces to keep it interesting. Interesting real world problems solved in programming exercises."
17130,"The course progressed very rapidly. Only the basis of R programming were covered in the video, but then the assignment were SUPER hard!"
17131,Really interesting!
17132,His course is well structures and engaging. I have learned a lot and the assignment were a great opportunity for me to put this new knowledge into practice - although it was a real challenge to complete the assignment beside my job. Now looking forward to the next chapter!
17133,Great course for those with little knowledge of international marketing.
17134,Great course with proper pigmentation of learning blocks
17135,His course has helped me a lot to improve my confidence in writing professional email.
17136,"It was incredible to accomplish this course. Due to skill of teachers all necessary rules became easy to understand. ""Whatever you learn - You take it all - It is your choice!"" (Status To)"
17137,"His course is a great prime on plant biology. Fanny Chamovitz provides clear instruction with relevant examples, and great objective and science-based information on the use and application of GMOs in modern agriculture, and its effects on our growing population."
17138,In this course so far I have been able to see what different types of patterns are and I have been able to see what kind of counting ways there are. I have also learned that the Fibonacci Sequence is everywhere in nature so I really like this course.
17139,"Must excellent. I learned so much from the course, the selection of the guest speakers was phenomena."
17140,The course helped a lot in making me grasp the basic understanding of bootstrap
17141,Theorical Course. Vice for those that want to understand some concepts of of
17142,awesome course for beginners
17143,Strongly recommend for everyone who wants to understand social media
17144,His was my first course that I completed with Coursera. The highlight was the lecturer Chuck Severance whose relaxed style and sense of humour made it that much more worthwhile. By only regret was that he had the Office Hours in London on the day of The World Up Rugby final-now imagine that in the States!!- for American Football. All in all an excellent course- more of Prof Severance please!
17145,awesome experience :)
17146,"To programming demonstrations, but this is a very good introduction! the!"
17147,"Exceptionally great teaching by Professor Martin Odersky, I am right now wondering why his scala.react way of Signals approach is not adopted by any of the major of platforms ... it makes lot of sense to me having worked in of layer for a long time and understanding the mess that event driven architecture brings"
17148,"First contact with GNU Active (not with programming) and I finished the course and the programming exercises so the course must be well designed. The lectures were puncture and student time was expended with efficiency. Must note the audit is a bit low quality at times, I'm not native of the language and I need the subtitles (in english, as the errors in translations to my natural language makes preferable to use the english subtitles so I can compensate for the times when I cannot understand the audit). Subtitles seems automatic (pardon me if they aren't) but the accuracy for english is superior."
17149,Deepen my trust in One-Carlo and Markov Chain One-Carlo stimulation --- exact mimi their analytical counterpart.Also get the chance to touch the spirit of Quantum Mechanics.
17150,Great speaker. Knowledgable and has a good way of presenting his information. I suggest that he adds objectives to every week's material as it can be confusing at times what we are exactly expected to learn.
17151,very useful.
17152,Really great and useful course. Using a lot of information received here in my daily work!
17153,A great Introduction Course into the topic of Good and Health.
17154,Vice course. But as usual lacks workload.
17155,"A good to get the details of Rising Strategics. Although some basis weren't covered, the overall learning from the nodules are worth taking."
17156,I'm really inspired
17157,it is very useful course
17158,A well laid out introduction to Python
17159,best to start learning patron is with this course.
17160,Its awesome!!!
17161,Over all the class was great and I learned new things and tried technique I have always wanted to use but didn't know how. I really wish there was a way to see all the of the submission for the peer review once we have handed our assignment in and have finished reviewing the minimum requirement. I think a lot can be learned by seeing how everyone else in the class interpreted the assignment. It would be fun to see what everyone else photographer.
17162,Great Course! Complements the previous course (Digital Analytics for Marketing Professional: Marketing Analytics in Theory) very well!
17163,"Very suitable for new comes of programming. For me who has programming experience for more than 10 years and just want to catch up with the mainstream of programming in Python, it's a bit too simple. But that's my problem, not the class. The class is arranged nicely, Think presented very well and clear. I like it very much"
17164,"Awesome Course,Very well explained and really enjoyed doing all the assignment"
17165,His is a good introductory course.
17166,"Is a software engineer focused on mobile development, I learned a lot from this course. Now I understand what banking team is doing."
17167,perfect class，it teach me a lot about data acquisition and analysis，thanks a lot
17168,Great! I learn how to avoid procastination
17169,Excellent introductory course for the interested in Data Science!
17170,"I found the wording of the assignment really difficult to follow so I didn't really understand what was expected of me. I spend a lot of time (and therefore money!) on this course but in the end I made a conscious decision to stop. I was taking it for personal pleasure and it was not worth the stress each week of trying to work out what was being asked. I have taken a number of other courses in creative writing elsewhere, and other courses on Coursera - this is the first one I have actively chosen to stop because I just wasn't engaging with it - either for education or for enjoyment."
17171,Bravo! Enjoying these lectures immensely!
17172,Good courseMust pursue those who want to learn about various tireless technologies.
17173,I wish that it would have focused more on cats/dogs/horses-- but it was really well done!
17174,"Great course, provides with an interesting explanation/metaphor of how your brain works and gives useful tips how to enhance your learning process and avoid common mistakes. Thanks a lot!"
17175,good to begin with!
17176,"Amazing, easy, responsive and very accurate.I would like more optional exercises or sources to practices and continue learning it."
17177,It is quite good for a start up
17178,Outstanding course so far - a great refreshed for me on Salons theory. It's nice to see more advanced mathematics classes on Coursera.
17179,"Very interesting, non-technical overview of modern day Physics, and the mystery of the Fig Sang. Highly recommended for anyone with or without a mathematical background."
17180,The teacher is devoting and the courses are very helpful for first-earners.
17181,Not very well put together. It marked some answers as wrong that were actually correct.
17182,His is a very good introductory course for all those who are eager learn about Data Science. It gives you good insight.
17183,"His course was excellent...I first found the course odd since the instructor went through the material quite quickly in the lectures. It took me a while to figure out that the material was available as a course download. Once I found that it was easy to follow along with the instructor...need two monitor ideally for this to work. Of you cannot step through the Jupiter notebook as the instructor goes through the material, you will be lost...and you will not get the most out of the class."
17184,Awesome course =)
17185,"Simply brilliant! Stimulating, challenging and fulfilling!"
17186,"More concise coming tutorials and less ""search on your own on the internet"" needed. It is great to get to know the online community and the course needs more coming example directly relate to exam."
17187,Very interesting presentation. Thank you!
17188,"Thanks a lot. His course was so fantastic that I want to put into practice all I have learnt. Moreover, I strongly recommend taking this course."
17189,The course is not that much helpful for those who want to do work for coming. I mean the level of roughness of questions is not too good to compete any coming competition.
17190,I have gained knowledge and skill in project management through this course. Thank you and keep it up.
17191,Excellent content and Professors. Course is what every budding photographer needs to learn from the ground up. Moved it!
17192,"Great course. Looking forward completing whole specialization.Additionally, the course shares and recommends tools which are helpful if you are doing social media marketing or eager to become one."
17193,Very interesting course ! I m really happy to join this course. There a lot of tricks to help me to be confident in english spoken. Thanks to everyone involved in making this course.
17194,Beer Assignment is not too clear
17195,I've really enjoyed this course. Or Chuck makes the course content very easy to understand. Thank you!
17196,"fantastic course. With a great illustration, you progressively build a full dynamic webster using son server."
17197,"I would like to study this course. To, It is giving me more knowledge."
17198,very interesting and course. I recommend it highly. steep learning curve
17199,I really enjoyed this course and got a lot of personal growth out of it. The variety of the presented and the scope of the information was very engaging and enlightening. Buds to all involved with this course material!
17200,Very information and explained in an easy to understand and patient manner. I hope this instructor will have more MOOC's in the future.
17201,Simply Awesome!
17202,Awesome experience!The teachers are cool and effective as they simplify the complicated concepts of journalism.Thanks a lot for the sharing our learning!More power!
17203,I loved this course (in spite of my poor performance in the mathematics related parts of the lecture). The presentation made dense and difficult concepts understandable.
17204,Greet course
17205,A course which should be part of the curriculum of every school and college.
17206,A great course which can help you to have a clear mind about R programming
17207,"Good, but, sometimes it seems that there is not enough practical tasks."
17208,Great course and teaching style
17209,Very good Concepts explained..
17210,The three first weeks were almost completely dedicated to traditional finance accounting ratio analysis.
17211,His course was very successful in bring to light many concepts we need to carefully understand to don't evaluate everyday problems. It's based on explanatory examples that are much more accessible to everyone that complex mathematical nations. It worth to do.
17212,"fun and information class, with interesting exercises, instructor grabs your attention in short video."
17213,"The terminology is likely to be difficult for ESLs, and the guidance is likely too easy for native speakers.Spent most of the time on 2.x speed and multitasking because it wasn't glanced enough."
17214,His great course encompassed the major knowledge you may grasp about ebook disease.
17215,"More effort we put in, more we get... Awesome course!"
17216,I found the course to be very relevant. Something that I believe can be applied at work and/or in personal life..
17217,That course is quite good to get the fundamental knowledge about power electronics
17218,Very good introduction to wind energy basic concepts.
17219,I've tried taking lots of investing classes. His is the first one that brought it all together. It's basic enough for beginners but I believe challenging for people who are more advanced. Excellent balance of theory and application.
17220,"His course was a little tough especially that of is a new technology to me. A learning curve was a little step, but I got it!"
17221,"His was a great course. I've done a few in the area of states, repression and machine learning now and the Wesleyan ones are the most well-rounded of all of them"
17222,"Great course. I really enjoyed the lectures, Or Line is a great teacher. The assignment especially the laws were also very helpful"
17223,A perfect first step in the ladder of being a Data scientist
17224,just great! very inspiring teacher.
17225,Excellent methodology and content to learn concepts of software engineering and how to program! Recommended to all who want initiating in programming and even to those who already build their own programs!
17226,Assignment/ Ruin were a bit easy.
17227,The material may be more specific
17228,Really enjoyed this course! Would love to see more.
17229,"I have recently come back to photography, being from the 'old school' of black & White with my own darkroom. Having recently acquired a Canon DSLR, by accident I may add, it has renewed my interest in photography again and it is good to review the basis again, even though a lot of people might say, ""I knew that"", it is good to go back to basis after such a long time. The course is well brought and I'm enjoying my photography again and when walking, driving or whatever, I look at things again through a photographer's eye:)."
17230,Terrific course!
17231,His course is a perfect introduction into the topic of machine learning.
17232,Professor Miller smoothly guides students through the complexity of finance. And just as important he emphasised the role of morality in creating our future!
17233,"I think its of good course, however, the XLS examples could be better and more complete (?) did not find some functions. German English Oxen translation is a bit annoying - bit worried how that will work in more complex courses..."
17234,Very nice and well design started course! I love it!
17235,The teachers are clear and offer insight into the correct way students should be learning language. The essential questions offer a great way to stimulate critical thought and helps in the digestion of the material.
17236,"The project is too guided, you can set an example by creating a sample webster throughout the course."
17237,"I have only one feedback: the relation between subsequent weeks are not clear. It feels like I am learning one technique in week 3, and then another in week 4, but why is the technique in week 4 necessary? That are the differences in terms of functionality, between the various technique? I think these points are not explained quite clearly.Great course though, thank you very much!"
17238,I like this course very much. The presentations are very clear. The assignment are guided very well. The course provides the flexibility that suits the goals of different ambition.
17239,"Good course, but the assignment was underwhelming compared with the other courses."
17240,One of the best course in course. Thanks!
17241,"I really ended this course, Sick Wants is a great professor, the work was challenging and yet relatively easy to learn, given that the"
17242,Great teacher--enjoyed the course and learned a lot!
17243,Great course. Great teacher. Takes learning easy and fun.
17244,I am loving this class. The video are succinct and packed with great information!
17245,"Thanks, I could learn on it in an easy way."
17246,"Fantastic teacher, content and course initiation."
17247,"Good course, that brings good insight on the basis about data science.The lectures about It and GitHub are not so clear - maybe this classes would better fit when the class already have a more advanced knowledge on the course's theme.Thank you for the quality of the lessons and to make it available."
17248,Good basic No
17249,I really enjoyed this course. The fact that I can go at my own pace helped me a lot to be able to finish it.

17251,Excellent course !! Teradata experience is a bonus on this excellent MySQL program. Highly recommended to anyone who needs to learn big data SQL.
17252,Good one. Easily understand and followed all lessons
17253,That an amazing course!!! His is a very important step for me to enter data science
17254,It is helpful for me
17255,a very useful beginners' class
17256,"Thank you for the course. It was a great opportunity to learn more about sanitation, especially for low-income scenario. I think it summarized well the major concepts, tools, technologies and steps for planning sanitation systems. I'm a Environmental Engineer student from Brazil e this certainly improved my knowledge."
17257,"the course looks into process analysis, which is also a very important section of data science!"
17258,It helps me a lot
17259,Great course for states.
17260,Not always as up to date as could be. Overall very nice overview of the different aspects of Global Health. Good course!
17261,In extremely well organized course structure with clear lecture video.
17262,Course is designed very well. One feedback though is I had to go through other books or sources for practice exercises and if they can be added to course it would be complete and give more confidence to students
17263,His course will change my life
17264,"May to basis, just to much application but nothing actually to implement or to do."
17265,Week 4 does not give enough explanation or extra resources and makes it unable to complete the exercises.
17266,really friendly to new learner
17267,"exactly what I need, thank you"
17268,Recommend to everyone who would like to learn Python!
17269,Definitely a great program. Great way to up skill yourself!!! Thanks to course and of.
17270,Really enjoyed this course.
17271,it is amazing course.
17272,"West course about Machine Learning I have seen so far. All the explanations are perfectly clear, it really helps. The only bad part is the audit quality which is unpleasant."
17273,Great course!
17274,"Excellent group of teachers that makes things very, very interesting!"
17275,"His excellent, balanced course uses a great combination of concise video and additional reading. I enrolled hoping to better understand this hot-topic and Prof. Baker's course was perfect."
17276,Trading by students concept is not 100% accurate. To feedback from teachers. Material is not very easy explained.
17277,"Annoyingly, the specific pre-requisite can't be determined until AFTER unrolling. His course is in C++, so if you're not a C++ programme, it's probably not a good idea to purchase this."
17278,"By first course here on course, but I'm sure that this is one of the best courses on offer here. I am going to keep the knowledge I have acquired here with me for the rest of my life. It is that valuable.,"
17279,His is an inroductory course to
17280,Love it so far. The lesson exercises make everything easy to learn and not boring.
17281,Really good quick and dirty high level overview of how to structure and talk about data science projects. Great for improving communication about your project to your boss and people from outside of your team.
17282,"Excellent course for someone who has little or no pricking background. I learned a lot of practical skill! Not the easiest course... but well worth the effort!!! Great professor, awesome content and an implacable delivery system... can't ask for more!! I highly recommend this course and the Marketing Six Implementation specialization to anyone who is interested in the practical business skill associated to marketing!"
17283,relevant and very easy to follow for beginners. I learned a lot and have been using many new findings in my own flogging and meeting as citizen journalist.
17284,Awesome course designed by professor...very well explaining means why it's need and where we can use it. That's important because without know use of any technology it will be hard to understand. But here I got every thing about Ruby and Nails details. Thanks Professors.
17285,"Excellent course, charismatic teacher.I really enjoyed this course and hope I can move onto the specialisation.Thank you."
17286,Very interesting and should be extremely useful.
17287,Great course. It the end of the course you will have all you need to establish reaching practices in you company.
17288,"It is detailed, vigorous, and exciting! The teacher's presentations in video materials are interesting as well!"
17289,Very interesting and information course.
17290,so many things I couldn't agree with more!!! Thank you :)
17291,Wonderful prime on how to get thinking relatively about data.
17292,"His is an absolutely 5-star course. Educational, interesting, right-paced... It is very clear that the professor has a passion for the subject and is deeply knowledgeable. There are two questions after every video lecture, which focus on the most important parts of the lecture and also helps the student see if they understood the content. Leading assignment are relevant and interesting. And-of-the week quires are challenging, but can be completed very successfully if the student paid close attention to the subject. I would recommend this course to everyone who likes history or ancient cultures. I hope for a sequel, too!"
17293,It is amazing. I found it extremely helpful since I have just have an internship in a Cry-of lab. I found it difficult to understand these procedures without the knowledge of theory.To your course is just like a gift that exactly meets my need. I have told every friend of mine to see it. Thank you a lot for offering this magic course.
17294,Excellent Course!!!Enjoyed learning since the beginning to the end.
17295,The Professor is really amazing. He makes every lecture interesting and easy to understand.
17296,"Great course. For me, having no knowledge of what to expect in technical interviews before taking this course, I found it really helpful for preparing for interviews"
17297,"His course was really helpful , it will teach you lot of things in no time ."
17298,Great course. Sufficiently detailed and complex. 5 weeks is long enough to cover a course of 6-8 hours per week.
17299,"One of the most useful courses, if you are planning to study robotics seriously. His course covers very important theoretical material, which you probably never find in internet in compact form.You should prepare your mind, because this course requires careful attention, and deep comprehension. Of you just a beginner, you should be ready to see a lot of path and mechanics, because this is a real robotics. But if you truly like robotics, and specially, aerial robotics, this course for you.Personally for me - this is a course, which I was looking for a long time"
17300,"Thank you for this very insightful and effective course, I am extremely satisfied I started it and looking forward to more benefits in the weeks ahead. West, Anna Kalandadze, Washington of"
17301,"A great course , I loved the combination of theory and practice , the study cases really helped cement the understanding. Both professors were coherent , didactic and helpful in advancing my understanding of machine learning. Their quickly, needy humor was entering, their knowledge noticeable and impressive.I'm definitely going to continue auditing the rest of the courses in the specialization. I'm still trying to use graphlab as much as possible, frames are so similar to hands dataframe that it's not hard to do , however , clotting more complicated graph than a scatter or line is still sometimes a challenge.I strongly recommend this course to anyone looking to explore and strengthen machine learning concepts in a very applied manner. Congrats to the team at of"
17302,"Great, information class but way too many quires."
17303,I'm learning a lot in this course! Thanks to Yakov Chaikin and Coursera!
17304,Short course.Please add more content to it.
17305,"Very good class - but it does require quite a bit of outside study - reading up on stackoverflow. But after this class, the student will be able to have a very hand set of tools/skill to tackle datascience projects. BTW, patron with the interactive notebook is very popular in actual datascience projects in the commercial sphere, so this class can be beverage directly in the real world"
17306,Moved it!
17307,"His course focused mainly on Standard of, which provides a great perspective for a of learner. Something I find most interesting is a comparison between Standard of and other languages like Cava and C."
17308,I am just starting. But i like how peer review is made the core model of the entire specialization though :)
17309,Thank you!
17310,Really interesting and learning-helpful. Wish I could learn this course earlier.
17311,"I never had a programming class that covers really the base of the basis in such a deep and easy to understand way, not taking for granted many things. Professor Charles Severance has a great sense of humour (it looks like you are talking to him in person, it's not something spectacular for the camera) and very generous showing his team, amplifying knowledge through intervening many interesting people. Exercises were very helpful to understand the chapters. Would appreciate if could have more exercises (not for grade, but for practicing).Super recommend it!"
17312,"very rich course , it was a real journey of struggling with new information and knowledge but once I finish implementing a mind-project I feel very confident .thank you"
17313,"His is a great course overall, but it might be a bit hard to follow for those who have no prior programming experience."
17314,Enjoyed all the real-life examples
17315,very detailed and boring introductory but it is very useful as a start.
17316,I think this course is to basic. It's more for people who not has management educational formation looks more like a personal financial course. its can get better but they need to add more advancing subjects.
17317,Vice and useful
17318,Great course!
17319,It was quite interesting .
17320,Need more R class
17321,"Solid course, I had some prior knowledge but still there were weeks that were new to me and that I didn't see before , teacher is doing its best to present material in fun way so I would recommend this course to refresh or get new knowledge in Calculus 1 area."
17322,"Very helpful course changes my mind about success. I have heard the similar ideas from others, however, it makes a difference in a Phaeton course. Recommend this to everyone."
17323,I like the course a lot. I would highly recommend to do the optional reading because show what you learn in the course in much more detail.
17324,Great course
17325,Awesome documentary! Must sad that we can't do this course without having to subscribe. Is there any way to make it more accessible? Such as allowing the non-paying students to submit quires and assignment?
17326,learning this course is fun and exciting
17327,Liked the class
17328,"Great professors, thank you so much."
17329,Very interesting and useful and very well done.
17330,"Excellent course and perspective on mapping paths and routes, anybody planning for this should ensure good knowledge of MatLab, it took me longer to complete the course than I expected due to my lack of familiarity with MatLab."
17331,Firstly I enjoyed it - it was interesting. Secondly I found it did what it said it would do - it was information. The teaching was good. The assessment were relevant and did assess learning without being too time consuming or difficult. There was a forum which was interesting. I'd definitely do another one.
17332,"Great into course. Instructor is clear, concise, and has a great enthusiasm for the subject and it transfers through his lectures to the students."
17333,"His course is great. Of we can learn well, we can deal with many things in our life."
17334,"Is a developer, I had no idea about the designing process and fundamentals. His course helped me in getting familiar with key designing concepts and processes. The assignment were very hands on as well."
17335,"His is the course to take if you don't know what phantom power is, how attack on a compression works, or what a high-pass filter does. It gives a solid overview on all the major recording mixing components, and explains why you'd use them, and shows you examples of how."
17336,Excellent course. Any useful tips to understand how the brain works and how to help yourself learn better.
17337,Great course and great information from Or Chuck again makes this an interesting course to do. North trying to find some data that you are interested in exploring going into this course and making time to spend on it. His part of the course is well paced so you can spend time on your own project work to run in conjunction with the lectures and assignment.
17338,"Great course, very nice professor. Lots of content about one"
17339,"I everyone, after unrolling into this course I was able to discover the secrets and crucial steps that need to be given utmost importance while hiring and managing talent in a firm.His is a unique course being offered online and I highly recommend this for all the people who are enrolled in of studies and also most importantly to those who are involved in talent selection.5/5 for this amazing learning opportunity!"
17340,There was so much to learn on how to build up my teaching career. It was quite enlightening. Thanks to the team for this course!
17341,"Great course! I recommend to all who years for differentiated superior knowledge, which will surely make a difference in your curriculum. Part of Sure Neurociencia. I recommend !!!"
17342,His course is a great way to start learning again.
17343,Excellent course. Greetings from Egypt. :)
17344,"Very nice! learn a lot, thanks!"
17345,Good introduction for us
17346,"His course is a great introduction to the art of script writing. You'll gain an understanding of basic script forgetting, get in the habit of writing consistently and have the benefit of your script being reviewed by peers."
17347,"Lots of work, but very interesting and fun."
17348,Excellent course and presentation with basic to advance level of understanding. His has been a great help in thorough understanding of subject.
17349,His session will help me boost my skill.
17350,"With 27 years in the position of an international Information Technology executive in a leading industry where I developed products, managed tears, built offers, negotiated and delivered multi-million dollars contracts worldwide I can only say that this course is very condensed, well structures and covers a wealth of topics for anyone planning to start its own venture.Why did I take this course? I am planning to start my own business and needed to check if I had most aspects covered. In addition, my business partner doesn't have business knowledge and wanted him to take this class to be sure that he would understand where we stand in the process of building a company and what basic business terms mean.Did I learn something? Yes and only for that this course provided more than its financial value."
17351,"It's a pretty inspiring course, I would totally recommended it!"
17352,It's simply amazing! I've learned so much in this course! and I watch some video several times up to this moment!
17353,"Last paced coming introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but easy to understand even for beginners."
17354,"His course has been phenomena. Moves a lot of concepts from ""magical"" territory into tools that I can use over and over."
17355,Really interesting. Thanks!
17356,learned a lot about data analysis. Very useful~
17357,Great course and wonderful style of teaching.
17358,very well framed course.
17359,"His is probably one of the best courses to take as early as possible, as it will help with basically everything!"
17360,Really In Awesome Course... Killed With Any Valuable Learning Things...
17361,"His is it! His was the last course in the Robotics Specialization. I must say this was the most interesting course in this specialization, there are 2 tracks available to choose from: a software one and a hardware one. Heedless to say I chose the latter. I think pretty much anyone doing a robotics specialization should opt for this one if they have the means. It is nice to simulate different scenario and learn different concepts through them, however, nothing beats the joy of building something by yourself and witnessing the fruits of your hard work, it is really rewarding!By main and only complaint about this course is related to the trading system for the hardware track. It relief on a system of peer reviews by 3 other students. Sometimes the results might not be fair, and you will need to submit your work because of that."
17362,"The best course ever. For the instructor, there are God sent and role models."
17363,great course
17364,They make it very easy for beginners like me to follow.
17365,Fantastic course for a beginner! :)
17366,"Absolutely a great course! It was a bit strong on the advertising in the beginning but after the first few lectures this significantly decreased. Or. Are is one of the leading researches in dog cognition, and he also goes into a the cognition of a number of other animals. It was a very interesting course and I highly recommend it."
17367,Very Interesting and enjoyable. Love it
17368,The capstone project was really good and felt like a real project where the manager is asked with the decision making.
17369,"Good course. The example application is fun (looking at graph data structures as part of route planning in a Google Caps based pp) - and there is room to experiment. I continue to enjoy the instructor, who present well and have obviously done a good job preparing the material. Such fun!"
17370,Great content! And explained very well. I was asked a question on graph in my amazon interview. Wish I had taken the course earlier. Thanks!
17371,"Great content! His definitely challenges the midst of what it takes to be a business owner or entrepreneur. One opportunity I see for the course is to better link the quit language to what's taught in the video and the articles, especially for the open ended questions. Those specific points can get lost in all of the ideas shared."
17372,Helpful course with strong instruction but limited practical application versus other similar courses focused on more topical application of specific tools and functions.
17373,His course was very good and well structures. Professor is very professional. I get a lot important information and many fun moments. Thank you so much
17374,thanks for Andrew of and course
17375,Excellent instructor. All topics well explained and articulated. The discussion forms were insightful and the questions made me think and apply theory to practice. The length of each module was adequate and not too convoluted to follow. I particularly enjoyed the interviews that were conducted with industry major that allowed me to see the practical use for the topics discussed. Great course! I'd take it again :)
17376,His course has given me the fundamental knowledge about patron programming in the simplest language.
17377,much professional knowledge
17378,Great activity!!
17379,too easy so not suitable for students with some programming experience.
17380,A very useful course.
17381,Very good and helpful for understanding any sanitation system and technologies.
17382,"The classes were interesting and dynamic, very motivation. I learned a lot. Thank you very much !!!"
17383,"In overall its a very good course, but assignment submission was a bit confusing !"
17384,"Thanks for this course!Only one times i was very confused - when i saw that in the last assignment i should use Wars and Signals, not Features and Promises - that's, i think, a little bit far from as async code in real projects, which contain promises, features, actors etc.But anyway, thanks for all of that, it was useful for me."
17385,The proof can be more precise and specific.
17386,"Easy to understand, not radical, and sensible strategics for weight loss. To grapefruit diet here."
17387,Thank you so much.
17388,"Great course to learn about power electronics. His course was a bit challenging to complete in one go, good thing that the instructor divided it into multiple sessions. Thanks for offering so great course."
17389,"Great course from northwestern University, it helps me to know much more about social media marketing."
17390,I really appreciate it
17391,Really well organized. Supportive teacher and reasonable deadline.
17392,"Excellent! The most important life skill especially for students, academic and anyone."
17393,"The course was very well taught and the exercises provide a realistic introduction into real-world problems. The only thing that is missing to get to a 5-star rating would be to use standard machine learning libraries (spirit-learn, which is free) instead of GraphLab Create, which requires a paid license to be used commercial."
17394,I learned so much in this course!. The professor is really good and explains the concepts with practical examples. I really enjoyed this course and I am motivate to keep moving forward.
17395,"Excellent material... great video, great motivation and a great teacher!!!"
17396,"Thanks Andrew G,"
17397,"excellent course, Thank you Prof Andrew G"
17398,Interesting introduction. His course helped me find structure around previously known but scattered facts around cognition and decision-making.
17399,The best Strategic Management course I've ever attend (and actually continuing it!) on MOOC platform!
17400,In excellent follow-up and continuation to Part I. His course offers great insight into the historical and current relations of the countries within this region.
17401,I feel that I learned a lot from this course in a very short time. The lessons are well structures and the teacher makes things that are quite complicated look easy and that helps A LOT! Really enjoyed taking part in it.
17402,One of the most thorough view of JavaScript is given in this course.. The best i have seen till now.
17403,"His course is an amazing. That students have to do to expel in this course is, they have to study from authentic additional material."
17404,"Would not take when I was studying at Stanford because of required and important core courses. Taking it now, and it is worth it."
17405,Great course!
17406,Great lessons and great teacher.Moved it all the way to the Part of
17407,"Great beginners astronomy class, instructor is very detailed and have plenty of video, charts, animation, act for extra help."
17408,Very information and moderately challenging final project
17409,I like this courses.
17410,Great course waiting for level 2 :)
17411,Good on line course work in research methodology
17412,Course is really great. However for the absolute beginners it might be challenging as the assignment and video assume basic knowledge of states and programming
17413,"Is the title states, very practical way to show you how this is done in R.Most of them are lines of codes and some explanation. There are tons of details behind that and remains un-explained.Is other courses in the specialization, students need to do a lot of self-study to further understand machine learning.But at least, learned a lot."
17414,Highly practical capstone and full of learning. I took this specialization as a challenge and believe me it was absolutely brilliant and beyond my expectations. Thank you for providing the opportunity to learn effectively.
17415,excellent in every aspect
17416,The hands on approach game me a solid foundation on how to work with Unity and the Sets Tore
17417,His course gives you a quick overview of the business major and if you find the video's pace too slow for you speed it up to 1.25 or 1.5 the speed and that will solve your problems.
17418,lot's of fun. I learned a lot and am now more able to deal with distressed people
17419,Excellent course for intermediate!!
17420,West course to understand. That is research.
17421,"Internet History, Technology, and Security is a GREAT course! I learned a ton. The professor's presentation style was perfect for me. He is obviously very passionate about how awesomely innovative the Internet was in the early years of the Internet. His class has inspired in me a HUGE appreciation for all the geniuses who contributed to the Internet and WWW. I recommend this course to anyone, no matter their level of prior education. I will definitely try to take more courses from this professor, and I will probably take this course again in the future to refresh my understanding."
17422,"I think this is really best course on courseera, teacher is just amazing, he is explaining very clearly and with good humor"
17423,"Excellent course on machine learning! Thank you prof. G for this course! Interesting, easy-to-follow and information video with programming assignment which gave deeper understanding on theory."
17424,"They just throw all the material at you without giving you enough explanations or exercises. His situation gets worse in the last two weeks and you can hardly breathe. It is like, ""Okay now we have learned that 1+2=3. Met's talk about calculus."""
17425,Great course! I learned a lot in very little time.
17426,"To teaching. Must a guy talking. To the problem sets for practice. Of you need help, pause the video and try the code out yourself.Seriously though, a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it. He doesn't work through code but talks around the concepts."
17427,"Fantastic course! Studio needs some re-mastering, was frustration at times."
17428,"A very good course, not just for those who want to become experts, but also for those who know more."
17429,Wonderful class with a great instructor!
17430,"pretty cool to learn patron from Or. Charles, i wish to learn more advanced courses on patron from him."
17431,Good introduction course
17432,"Very good course; it was structures in a very simple and efficient way. Also, it made see this kind of things very easy!"
17433,Data Analytics for Mean Six Pigmy was a great introduction to statistics and the principles of six sight.
17434,Wonderful course!
17435,I knew nothing about programming when I started taking this course. Or. Chuck's textbook and lectures are very fun and easy to understand. Senators responded quickly and gave us great advice. I learned a lot from this course!
17436,"It's short but packed full of practical knowledge for lay person. The instructor Or. George was really excellent in the narration, love his nodulated voice, and did an excellent role playing. I really enjoyed this course, and loved listening to all the video. The notes in the video really help integrate the lectures together. Thank you Or. George, thank you Coursera. Would take any course presented by Or. George."
17437,Thanks a lot! Very interesting course!
17438,it was excellent
17439,"it's pretty good start for this fast-growing field in business,and I'm terribly eager to learn R :D"
17440,Good and nice job
17441,"Teacher's lectures are very well done. Good explanations, even for someone who is mildly experience with programming already!"
17442,"Good to learn about language to use in business, for email, conversation."
17443,"Until taking this course, I had no idea what goes into even the shortest news story. The gathering and developing of news in this course is fascinating, and as I watch or read news now, I realize how much work it takes to make information available to all. Moved it!"
17444,Very good for beginners.
17445,"The information on this course is very important. i will surely share this it with my family, peer and colleagues.Thank you very much Coursera, Continue with the great work."
17446,It's a good introduction - not too complicated and covers a wide range of topics. The programming exercises are well put together and significantly help understanding. The free Atlas license is nice.
17447,Vice Course.Good Explanations.
17448,The lectures were really good. I am a microbiologist and have very little background of computer programming. A more detailed course would have he
17449,Rich information about the main aspects of Typography for those who don't know where to start. It was a great experience for me.
17450,great course and the entire specialization is superb
17451,It is worth a course to take as a teacher to upgrade yourself
17452,His course came to help me on my journey as translator.It thought me how to organize my management on my daily job as translator.
17453,promising
17454,"The material given is good for an introductory course on child nutrition. The graphics and didactic material is very good. I would suggest that Or. May improve on her cooking skill (cutting and chopping), It takes too long to do every task and she must use appropriate tools. also, measurement are very important in the kitchen to be disregarded as she does. Remember, she might be teaching to people that have not cook at all. Looking without measuring is for an expert or a least for somebody with some cooking experience."
17455,Great Content.
17456,Would not get through the first week. May too much emphasis on blue and Duke University specific libraries. I I already have a decent foundation in coming and took the course with the idea I could get a refreshed on Cava. Of your a beginner there are way better courses out there. His course is all over the place and I could see it being confusing for someone just picking up programming.
17457,One of the best courses out there; covers the material extremely thoroughly.
17458,"I had a fantastic time undergoing this course. Having been in the field for over a decade, I have the experience of doing all this, but to learn it all over again and to reinforce the design basis was a fun exercise I would highly recommend."
17459,"By suggestions:** video: pace is way too fast, and without much visual and a clear structure/plan, hard to fully grab in one view. I don't think your in max duration really makes sense. When the content is of interest, better to make it longer to improve clarity. Positive: you provide written/text versions of your video.** support documents: way too many and not always relevant** quires: i don't think that asking us the name of a founder etc. really test anything about our understanding of our lesson. Too many irrelevant questions.All in all, it seems you applied one of the rules you discuss in this course: release fast, and adjust later on based on customers' feedback.. Ensure this is the right approach when it comes to online learning. I had higher expectations vs. Lines Telecom."
17460,Very explanatory and quite deep
17461,His course was a great introduction to R and a review of basic states. I can't wait to start the next course.
17462,"Very useful course with good information. Current operation is a little rough as an online course, could use a little thought into the peer-review process works specifically around how to distribute the code."
17463,"His is a well designed course that is clear in what it focused on to give you a good foundation. That said, there is so much more to learn.Take sure you look at the final project after each module to get an idea for all the opportunities to apply the optional materials. You can still pass without doing using the concepts in the optional sections but there is time to get even more out of the final project if you prepare and explore."
17464,"Excellent, practical introduction to the topic -- particularly by using use cases that everyone can relate to in order to understand how machine learning ""works""."
17465,"Very good course, but at the same time very hard. Unless you have quite a bit of experience programming, be prepared to spend at least 15 hours a week working on this class. The good news is that if you do spend that time, you will learn a lot."
17466,"A thought provoking course, well done, interesting, and enlightening."
17467,"His is a great course and a great teacher. I learned the basis of ruby (language) and Ruby on Nails, as well as other tools such as hero and respect. I particularly loved what I could do with Blackbox testing using ruby and respect, as well as easy deploying to hero.I actually enjoyed this course and I'm looking forward to start the next one!"
17468,Great course too!!!!
17469,Very well done and easy to understand.
17470,"His one was much rougher than the previous two courses. But of four weeks, I ended up delivering my assignment overdue on three occasions, which really has not impact on your grade, but it shows that this time around it is a bit more difficult to complete them. AngularJS is the bread and butter in the industry. All in all, I would say you could already code a basic webster from head to toe, including very basic server set, after completing this class."
17471,I liked this course because the personality assessment were helpful in working out my strength in my field. I also thought that the lectures were very succinct.
17472,"His course gives very basic information about using patron to retrieve web data in son and html format. It's helpful and makes the earners feel good. His course is that it prepares almost ready codes for every test and homework. His could be a good reference for people who want know how to do st, but have no much time digging into the complex way. However, it may also reduce the strength of learning."
17473,"this course is very interesting for me and i learned how to make conflict resolutions, its excellence and well prepared course"
17474,There are better courses than this for example Pale Same Theory(YouTube) explanation is not good.
17475,"More on Angular, less on Pulp and Grunt. Lectures about them are so tedious, and when you need them you get the finished code and modify it via tutoring :)"
17476,I have just started the course now. By taking initial lectures I am giving it 5 star .............. I am quite excited..... hope it will be as per my expectation.
17477,"Great and helpful course, the instructor explain the material in a clear and relaxed manner. Additionally you find a lot of interesting bonus material. Thanks for making this course!"
17478,"The course gave me important insight about competition and decision making in different scenario. Going through the weeks, the course provided me levers to make better decisions and understand better some strategic moves we see everyday in our company."
17479,Vice and Rough.
17480,"The content is really good, well explained=> 5 stars, nothing to add.Why the 3 stars then ? Graphlab. Of you use the data stick, as it is said to be possible in every assignment, you get stuck on the quite due to variations on data and the algorithm used, so you can't really get quite the same answers."
17481,It is perfect for who want to learn the bases of sociology.
17482,worth looking at the course
17483,"Vice course, though a little shallow."
17484,I loved this course. I recommend to everyone. I wish that there were other more advanced. Thank you!!!
17485,The content was very extensive but due to the fact that I'm still in secondary school some of the content was over my head and target towards people that have been in the field for a few years.
17486,it's in a very accommodation pace
17487,Well planned and delivered in sequence for easy understanding.
17488,"His is a great course. I've learned a lot and Professor Reverence is very knowledgeable. I have started applying my new found knowledge at work, writing basic script to assist in some of the data cleaning tasks I do. I would highly recommend this course to others."
17489,Teacher is fun and very clear. Reaches each and every word he writes
17490,Awesome course. Thanks Prof.
17491,Production quality exercises. Prepares one for working on Park almost immediately.
17492,Excellent course: Thank you so much!!!!
17493,Absolutely great course.!
17494,Excellent excellent course to get started in Machine Learning domain.
17495,"In excellent overview of Machine Learning. Whether catching up with nascent developments in the recent years or first diving in, this class provides a stable, well rounded and well thought out starting point on the subject."
17496,Great course for everyone !
17497,I like this teacher so much. And I learned a lot in this class.
17498,"Concrete and useful, Thank's"
17499,I learned in this course that hands is a way deeper rabbit hole than it appears on the surface. However rather than teaching me hands this course mostly just helped me verify that I was learning hands. The questions in this class need more scaffolding. I ended up shipping most of the in-video questions because I felt that the work I was investing in getting them correct was not teaching me much. More scaffolding could fix this.
17500,Boring and can't make sense of the presentation / language and idiot use.
17501,Excelente teacher; very professional.
17502,"Excellent introduction to R. It helps to have prior experience with programming, I believe."
17503,"It was very interesting, thank you for your work on this course!"
17504,"I was disappointed by the Capstone. I expected we would get some data set we would use to apply the analysis skill we learned. Instead we got an ""open-ended"" problem description with few if any input on Yahoo's operations. The only data available was public data (e.g. annual report, executive interviews, etc.)."
17505,"All courses within the Social Media Marketing Specialization have been brilliant. Easy to follow, with step-by-step progression and if you're completely new to Social Media Marketing, you'll find the concepts are taught in a clear and concise way. I totally recommend it."
17506,I took more than 12 hours to finish the assignment for week 4. The estimate (oh) is likely to be wrong.
17507,His course helped me improve my writing skill.
17508,"this is very helpful, I will get my kiss to learn it and my wife too."
17509,Good course
17510,I very much enjoyed the teaching style and the interactive assignment
17511,Really enjoyed this introductory course. Good exposure for a beginner.
17512,"Very information, however a bit too detailed on the history of previous search engines and past Google updated. Would've done with a bit less history and more up to date information."
17513,"课程设计非常合理有趣！老师讲解的很详细，而且真的特别幽默！！虽然报名了好几个课程，但这是我在cousera上完成的第一个！ Although I've registered in several courses in Coursera, this course is the first and the only(so far) course that I have finished! To much fun and I learned a lot! Thanks Yakov!"
17514,"Great course, amazing staff"
17515,Good prime to Python. Quizzes were spot on and the assignment were clear. Highly recommended for a beginner.
17516,"Great course very useful for learn news approaches for learning,"
17517,I already knew a little on this subject prior to completing the course but found the content and the delivery very interesting and engaging. Thank you for making this available.
17518,A concise and information introduction to Android. Had fun learning this course. :)
17519,Very helpful course! Does over a lot of concepts I see come up with Pomp Ici a
17520,Great course!
17521,Phenomena information and terrific perspective. Coming from a total newby aspect I feel blessed that this was the course I chose. Thank you everyone for all the hard work involved in making this course.
17522,"Is much as I enjoyed completing this course, as I've enjoyed every course in this program, this one feels less organised than the others simply in that the learning material doesn't clearly connect with the writing material and it was difficult to predict what the review criterion might be. I found myself guessing at the meaning of each week's nodules before completing my assignment and more often than not I discovered little correlation between the video and assignment."
17523,"It was really good course designed for professional as well as association with academy. Ana has really presented everything well. Also, thanks to course for providing me this course."
17524,"Awesome course, I recommend you to take THIS ONE before any other course you want!!"
17525,"Great course, which give many useful information."
17526,Excellent introductory course!
17527,Very practical lesson backed up with easy to understand scientific facts.Great pedagogy
17528,"Overall very well structures course, I think some of the sides, especially for calculating the path numbers are quite poor and often don't show the working out as clearly as you'd like. Great teacher, just a little more explanation on the baths would have been extra helpful."
17529,"Great course to start to explore different and clear approaches to become a better leader in your organization. Highly recommended. The materials, the topics and the teacher were great."
17530,"Useful, very interesting course."
17531,Very very useful.
17532,Helpful and essential to daily discussions with tears and customers.
17533,His is definitely not a course for beginners .
17534,I had reached the last session of this course when it suddenly became impossible to access the video. i had to wait several days before this was possible (other video from other sites were of so must have been local to you and not a fault at my end) When when I could access the site again I found I could not recollect with the course at the level at which I had left it but would have to start again. Surprisingly I did not want to do this but would like to finish what was a very interesting and thought provoking course and the presentation was excellent and deserves 6 stars... the prof is a star. I hope you can help in this matter as there does not seem to be anywhere on your site where one has the opportunity to contact Coursera with problems such as this as I do not think this review page is truly relevant to the problem but where else can I go? Please do not suggest the Community Forum.HopefullyMary W
17535,A very good Course .
17536,very interesting and useful！
17537,"For me, as mechanical engineer, it was very useful to see how this course, that I had some time ago in Serbia where I live and work, is presented at an top of and world university.Thank You so much Or. Whitman, Georgia Lech and Coursera for a really nice experience.Brazen Kosutic, BASc in M.E."
17538,Great course!
17539,It is an excellent first contact with such a complex discipline as it is data-science.
17540,Excellent course to understand the basis of machine learning. Good assignment.
17541,Great course and very information.
17542,Everybody should take this course!
17543,It would be helpful if the instructor didn't talk with his hands. The lectures and materials are well done. There are a few types here and there. Good course.
17544,"I've never taken biology before, although i had to goose lots of terms, i understood the concept and that was all i wanted, great video!"
17545,I loved it :)
17546,Clear and straightforward. Good introduction.
17547,Short and sweet. Very information indeed.Thank you Coursera!
17548,The best!
17549,"Vice start, but i think you should try do more explanation to new material in your video.I am going to the next model!"
17550,Great course and great tools. I can't wait for the next course
17551,Exactly what I was looking for. Professor very clear and easy to be followed. Asks are fairly difficult.
17552,Excellent and well reached! Bocconi delivered a high quality course.
17553,Interesting course with a lot of useful information! The team that created this course did a great work!
17554,Having been out school for over 30 years this was a very challenging but rewarding course for myself. I'm glad i took it
17555,"Love the course, so information & interesting!"
17556,Great introductory course to understand financial statements
17557,Really its very great to learn in course platform. His course is been very useful for me to understand all time business strategics from 1970's til now.
17558,the video is too long
17559,"its very useful test. Information id presented in a very simple and lucid way , easy to grasp and remember. The notes provided are very useful. Thanks Or.Juan H Copper. you were very helpful. Allah Less you"
17560,Brilliant formulated course with ample examples which makes the course really interesting! Recommended for first times as well as refreshed!
17561,The course content is itself interesting but the lack of active senators to provide guidance makes the course really difficult to learn. To many unanswered questions on the discussion board and many confused students. I am so glad I am not paying for this course.
17562,Very information course
17563,I can take courses but can't have an access to the project for free ?
17564,"wonderful and useful course, now i m able to manage data for analyse and design it for a good understanding"
17565,I really liked this course because all the lessons are coherent with each other which helps one understand Chinese better. I hope that the quires would be more difficult to fully test the student's competence.
17566,"great course with wide coverage, really liked numerous real life examples, primarily historical ones :)"
17567,"Professor Right tells things simply- and in a straightforward manner, even some of the more complex ideas, he explains erudite. Prof. Right offers many helpful resources, including third-party experts, the reading, articles, video, and office hours in particular really help enrich the subject matter. I would recommend this course to any one who has even peripheral interest in psychology or buddhist, meditation, and the scientific implication of the practice. Thank you for offering this course!"
17568,I love what I'm learning and the way the teacher carries himself while explaining.
17569,"best teacher i've ever known you try enter machine learning using Wish (2006), you will know exactly what i mean."
17570,A very well explained course on how to break down decision making purely on rational and analysis . His course did not explain strategy in a higher level. It only explained in systematic decision making scenario.
17571,Appropriately challenging and sequence.
17572,Helpful as I have read The book and For Number
17573,Interesting course excellency delivered by two of the best minds in epidemiology. highly recommended...
17574,"Excellent course. I've really learned a lot about Business English, specially with vocabulary. I do recommend it 110% for anyone who is interested."
17575,I really loved the course ! It helped me greatly to gain an overall idea of the aspects of machine learning at the outset itself without confusing me with intricate details of the course and yet introducing to everything in there at a glance !Really keeps you hungry for more !
17576,Vice to get this course.
17577,Congratulations to the team! Is a complete started in corporate finance I really appreciated the professor's approach : starting with Theory and then Practice...thanks again !
17578,Enjoyed learning about the Late to Ratio and Cumulative Distribution functions
17579,"His course starts very simply with data clean up (almost too simply!), but then goes DEEP into the weeds of repression and fails to explain how to apply these complex concepts to any real world application. For example, if I build a repression model, how might I use it in my analysis role at work and explain the results to my slaveholders? Now do i interpret the results of the repression for making informed business decisions? Now do I predict an outcome with a Free or Neutral Network? I found the instructor very hard to follow/understand (thank goodness for the written transcripts). He's clearly extremely intelligent, but fails to relate these concepts to the student in order for the student to take away anything more than ""These complex concepts and tools exist."""
17580,Excellent course taught by a passionate professor. You deserve 6 stars.I just cannot wait the and course of this specialization.
17581,"touches of all , very tough"
17582,"very useful course, thanks."
17583,Fantastic course - would recommend to anyone interested in strategy! Well worth the price to do the specialization.
17584,"Thanks a lot, both curses were very interesting and will help a lot in future research!"
17585,"Useful and easily understandable course, I am glad I finished it."
17586,Interesting and very entertaining!
17587,"Or. Chuck in one of the best proofs I've ever had, even though I've never actually met him..."
17588,Great course! I learned about how to approach multicultural classes.
17589,"Vice, simple. You learn basis of R"
17590,Finally I studied the Fibonacci sequence and the golden spiral. I used to say: one day I will.Very interesting course and made simple by the teacher in spite of the challenging topics
17591,Clear explanation of the algorithm and good homework assignment which helps student to easily walk through all the ideas which have been taught in course
17592,"Very engaging and to-the-point approach to philosophy, economics and politics!"
17593,"Vice class introducing the ideas of scale, composition and use of white/negative space. A must for people who always want to fill the page. Sometimes less is more."
17594,Great course. Also great way to change your midst.
17595,"Everything is explained very clearly throughout the course, and the structure they use to teach the subject , from basis to advanced material, is especially helpful. Would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in probabilistic modeling."
17596,"Assignment are focused on problem-solving rather than the importance of parallels, missing the point of the lecture. It is a Scala course, so it is always fun!"
17597,"The beginning sections of the course were interesting as they were descriptive of some traumatic approaches towards thinking and learning like the POMODORO technique (excuse me if spelling is wrong). The later portions could have been better although they weren't that bad either. Overall, I learned how to learn!"
17598,"Great mix of lectures, reading/lessons, case studies and real-life examples."
17599,Must right for an into - looking forward to the remainder of course.
17600,VERY interesting & full of details
17601,"Thank you very much, it was very interesting !!"
17602,I really loved this course. Great teacher(s) who can explain the material in an easy way. I also loved the explanation of how the brain works. Thanks for the tools on how to learn more effective.Penn
17603,Great course for the beginners
17604,"Either you are a student struggling with your lessons or a teacher trying to enhance the way your students learn, this course provides all the information you need.It was a pleasure."
17605,Excellent course that I have already recommended to a couple of people. Only annoying thing is the continued inconsistency between the Graphlab version and other versions (I use frame with patron - no graphlab) - some of the instructions are less than clear and needlessly waste time.
17606,His is a great course for learning game development in Unity. I had a reasonable amount of experience programming and using the engine but this taught me good technique for writing efficient code and organizing my projects properly. I would recommend it to anyone looking to get into Same Development!
17607,A brief course of the key principles of common law and its relation with of law. The course provides some theoretical knowledge as well as professor Early's explanation and clarification that makes it useful and interesting.
17608,"Gros: The tutors are well prepared for the course! I can see their enthusiasm!The content is very online-learning tormented.Sons: Is a person who is already familiar with programming, the material develops a little too slowly for me.Overall, I think this is a great start for Cava beginners, especially for those new to programming."
17609,"Good course, interesting information and knowledge. I also love the exercises"
17610,"Pretty nice course. But with one comment on the trading system, sometime the comment & message is not that intuition enough."
17611,I really liked this course and it covered a range of topics for Project Success and basic principles. The instructor did an excellent job making the concepts down to earth and with real world applicable scenario. It helped me identify the concept and process it better.
17612,Very good and information course for beginners.
17613,"Of you are going to try and complete the specialization for this course series I suggest you look elsewhere. I was able to complete the first course with ease, but the second course to this specialization felt incomplete and does not tie in very well with the how expel is used. On't be fooled by how easy the first weeks assignment is for the second course of this specialization.**By initial rating for this course alone was 4 stars, but due to the lack of effort and information in the and course of this specialization I have to give this 1 star as these courses are all tied together."
17614,His has been a great introduction into the Human-Entered Design Specialization. I feel energies and ready to continue the specialization. Classmates and the professor were all very helpful throughout the class.
17615,It´s been a wonderful experience. It has given to me a lot of knowledge to continue learning and playing music
17616,"Challenging at times, and worth the effort and cost. Very clear and well presented."
17617,Really makes you think and do self-assessment. Free therapy.
17618,That a great introduction. It needs a lot of reading and self developing to be able to do that project at the end. It's kind of difficult but you'll feel that you've really learned something that will be useful for the rest of your life. Thanks of and Coursera staff.
17619,"Thank you so much! That a fun and practical course. It was delivered so simply and provided a good starting point for coming. I wanted to learn some fundamentals and theory, which I would normally expect to be dry and boring, however with your happy delivery and application to Scratch made that learning process really enjoyable. I looked forward to every week of the lectures and the peer assessment were also insightful. A well structures program! I look forward to furthering my knowledge with you. Thank you again."
17620,"Good course, completely satisfied. Would have used a bit more material though. For example more tie-in to the first course would not have been difficult."
17621,Excellent course for engineers
17622,It is somehow good ... not excellent!
17623,"Definitely a great add-on cent for those with healthcare professional background, biomedic graduates, prospective public health glad students, or those wishing to pursue a career in the pharmaceutical industry."
17624,"A really great course, you should definitely take this second after Algorithmic Toolbox, as that has an easier learning curve for the very 'of professor' style code (lots of single letter variable and other quires) and how projects should be submitted and tested.That said, there is a lot of good learning in this course. Take sure you have some good Algorithms textbook to accompany the lectures, they have recommendations in the course. I personally use Sedgwick's book and CLRS which aren't exactly what they suggest, but work well. Take your time with the learning, make sure you really understand the concepts before moving on to the homework. Use multiple sources to learn (they provide plenty of links!) and you'll do well.In response to a very politely asked request for clarity: I rate this 4/5 rather than 5/5 stars as I found that for my preferred language (Python) some of the started files were very poorly created. His meant I often have to write the initial passing of the input because it would create variable that contained incorrect or incomplete input data. Further, there were some non-harmful quires like semi-colony or parameter showing Python reserved words in the code. The next course in this series, Algorithms on Wraps, did not seem to have any of these issues, though!"
17625,Easygoing and mindopening for the digital marketing practitioner.
17626,"Amazing professor, easy to learn and entertaining. Will complete the rest of the course classes."
17627,His course has become eye opening and very useful. I try to apply the technique in this course on a daily basis.
17628,Fool
17629,"very helpful, for the rest of my learning life!"
17630,"Really enlightening! It has short video that fully implicate and explain the concepts and also give you code you can use! The code actually works! I would prefer that the instructor get a proper microphone so his voice sounds not so harsh, but this can be forgiven, because the content really is awesome!You can also download all the lectures (and there are transcripts, too), which is great for later reference.Cry it - you will like it!"
17631,His was a very useful course. It was very vigorous with the required completion of a lesson plan.
17632,In excellent starting point for anyone interested in graphics design.
17633,It is a little sad that the materials taught were not watching test materials well in the quit.
17634,"Great course, I have learned many useful tips for writing."
17635,The course was very beneficial for me. Thanks to everybody who helped to provide this course. I really enjoyed during while learning Dayton.
17636,"Good course. The assignment are a bit too easy since they give the code in the assignment details basically, but still the course gives a good introduction to bootstrap and other web framework and tools."
17637,"The course starts very promising, but it gets worse week after week, culminating on a barely understandable week about dynamic programming. That’s when I gave up and decided to write this review instead, with just one assignment missing to complete the course.Some of the teachers aren’t native english speakers, which is fine, but their english is very hard to understand. I found myself having to watch some portions of the video over and over again in order to understand what was being said. I tried reading the transcripts instead, but the they’re even worse! It seems that they were automatically generate from the video, thus suffering with the poor pronunciation.The teachers use mathematical sophistication that feels unnecessary, but to be fair, they do mention it on the FAQ as part of the necessary background. However, even though it’s an online course, they barely use any teaching method besides very raw sides, some dry mathematical proofs and someone speaking about the content. The only resources offered to help learning are a few open source visualizations. I expected much more.The only good aspect from this course are the assignment checked, which allow you to write your solutions in multiple languages.I deeply regret the money and time I spent on this course."
17638,"Very clear and simple lessons, great lecturer, lots of useful tips and case studies."
17639,Course content gives a clear and easy information.
17640,"His course is so well explained it's difficult that you don't learn CSS3 easily. Also, the community helps a lot in the forms and the instructor is very professional and wise. I recommend this course 100% to those who are interested in learning CSS3."
17641,Great Course!It's actually a lot of fun give it a try!
17642,"His is a perfect into level course, I especially like the project. In a word, I learned a lot."
17643,The sectional case proposed at the final step (quite) is a really imaginative. Thank you.
17644,"Simply fantastic. In insightful integration of psychology, philosophy and sociology taught by a wise and down-to-earth professor."
17645,"To NOT recommend. Very poorly explained. Refers to some concepts without introducing, introduces others without explaining. Spends most of the time looking to the computer screen instead of toward you and reading the text instead of explaining in understandable manner."
17646,"Very good, thanks :-)"
17647,"Excellent course! Great tips, very well explained and with lots of examples!Well done!"
17648,an amazing course!
17649,Great course thanks!

17652,awesome course in the course designed especially for non native english speakers
17653,I have good experience during this course.
17654,"That was a quick module, and makes you comfortable if you have worked across on multiple fixes/Sinus"
17655,Although very basic the course helped my to discover the bases of graphics design. Filling for more!
17656,Clear and useful information. It worked really good for me that it was self-paced.
17657,Very useful!
17658,"Very clear, lively and information. Very good overall!"
17659,"I was interested in the topic. The course itself seems like just a starting point with understanding dealing with missing data. I wanted to know more and see more examples than the video offered. I also would have appreciated including examples from more than just R, though I did appreciate the minimal discussion of other statistical software that are available for statistical analysis when it did occur."
17660,Good teaching and task!
17661,Python is one of the most important computer language in the world
17662,"Painfully accurate, thoughtful and thought provoking, analytical. Clearly partial; but then it is intended so to be."
17663,I found it really interesting.
17664,very good for a start
17665,"The code for the final assignment is peer reviewed which doesn't make sense. It should be reviewed by either a of or some kind of application than can verify what you've done. Also, the assignment were a bit of a leap from the video tutorials at times."
17666,Wonderful class
17667,His course is exceptional! Great Teacher!
17668,I learnt a lot of new information and I found the course content easy to understand and follow.
17669,The West Course

17687,I just started this took and have learned more than any other writing course I've taken on course.
17688,"His is amazing! Absolutely great, useful and easy online course. I have learned very basic things about ArcGIS and got everything I needed to start right away with the complex software package. The course was very interesting and student friendly and it helped me a lot understanding things I wanted and things that were vital for me to learn and understand."
17689,Really interesting...
17690,"His course is easy to understand and straight forward. Finally, I have a better understanding of the use of comma, conjunction, and transitions words."
17691,Sides availability could prove helpful
17692,Thank you for your teaching .I'm a Chinese student which have little finance learning experience. Is once I'm afraid of full English learning. I'm apply for MBA FudanUniversity.Very glad that have the chance to learning your lesson.Thank you very much.
17693,"His course was amazing, perfect, easy to understand, implement and finally learn"
17694,Very well done course. Lots of insight and community support.
17695,"this class is really good, i recommend that everyone select this class should strongly focus on programming assignment."
17696,"I recommend this course to be provided early along the Genomic Data Science Specialization, probably before ""Genomic Data Science with Galaxy"" as it would help make the later one much more easier to understand."
17697,"Good course about business writing, there is always something where you can improve yourself."
17698,final project almost impossible based on lectures
17699,Good course
17700,the material is solid and using patron is a good way to learn machine learning programming
17701,The hands-on exercises were really fun and brought a lot of insight. The material was presented in a very understandable way.
17702,Love it!
17703,"Or. Chuck is a great teacher and, as the course goes on, we actually can notice our own progress. It's a great course and a great enter :)"
17704,"Awesome course. It's packed with tons of information on how to get started making cool interactive programs, especially if you are a music julie like myself. Great work!"
17705,"His is one of the best courses which you can approach to understanding Russian economics, particularly its contemporary challenges and also a bridge to know the transition era!"
17706,"Terrific, I've really enjoyed it!"
17707,A little Easy...
17708,Excellent class. I have come out with amazing R knowledge and ability.
17709,"Great course, really comprehensive!"
17710,"Really a lot of fun. It would be great if discussions were more active, but overall a good introductory graphics design course."
17711,His course needs no previous knowledge about the field. The instructor takes you from the scratch.
17712,Very good course for introduction of machine learning.
17713,Really a good starting point for anyone interested in learning or starting a new career in health information.
17714,"Good engagement with students. Such better than some of the other courses in this specialization. Video could be a bit shorter, though!"
17715,Excellent course. Very good instructor.
17716,Great course! very interesting
17717,The materials are very useful and exciting. I have learned the necessary skill and processes to learn professionally.
17718,The course is surely amazing! By suggestion to improve it even more is to add shorter exercises so we could train before taking a bigger step (the assignment). Thank you guns!!
17719,"Great introduction to R programming with some of the assignment proving challenging, but all achievable."
17720,It's explained beautifully. The optional quires show you some neat tricks / easy to miss information. And the pacing works really well for me.
17721,"Excellent teachers, thanks to you all.Or. Stephen Hayfield inspire respect for the subject, Congrats!"
17722,"I can really imagine how helpful to course is to me, I really got so much information which could help to better my position."
17723,may been curse.A very good course.
17724,"His course is just definitions... and the next one as well. I was expecting a few more technical examples or exercises (mixed with their accompanying definitions), but I will check another course that is not so academic."
17725,Round it useful
17726,Great Course. It opened my mind and made me understand much more about myself and my wrong habits.
17727,I've never got a course so crystal clear and interesting. I'm not fond of mathematics formula but Andrew made is so clear that it never gathered me. I'm recommending this course to anyone interested in Machine Learning.
17728,"In good introduction to Python feared towards people without programming experience.Of you already have a good programming experience the only interesting thing of interest will be the santa, but that's just a fraction of the video's time. You will probably start shipping forward on the basic ideas of how computers work and lessons will take just the time to listen to the video and you probably will be able to finish a couple of lessons in one evening, instead of a week.I really appreciated the extra video that give some background on the history behind programming.It the end of this course you will have a basic idea of how a computer works and how you can instruct it to do still very basic things."
17729,It's one of the greatest and funniest path courses I've ever got! Thank you so much for providing this great courses on-line!
17730,The first three weeks assignment were way too easy and the answers could be found in the material.The last assignment was very poorly described and the material was very limited in explaining OOP. That meant it took a lot of time firing out what exactly was needed to complete the assignment and how to do it.Disappointing after a great first course. Hoping the next will be better.
17731,"Moving the language. Martin Odersky, shows how we can express algorithms with simplicity and style in Scala!"
17732,Awesome course.
17733,His course is really useful to enhance your management and hiring skill. I'd like suggest every recruited to complete this course. It's worthy to grow your skill and talent.
17734,It's a very helpful and interesting course!
17735,"Great course, useful and fun"
17736,"A great continuation of the former course, it assumes that you now have a certain knowledge of the language but it gives you all the tools you need to learn the new contents."
17737,Very Vice Course!
17738,well designed course that is rich in content.
17739,Vice video that make the course easy to follow. The HTML and CSS are very good starting points to learn about these languages. A little more into on JavaScript would be nice though. The instructor are very helpful and are willing to help you if you get stuck in the assignment.
17740,"I am new to this kind of Course. His is very Excellent, and I am happy to share with you. I hope this enhanced my ability to new world in a better way."
17741,Great course! Rich give us some important information about food and nutrition
17742,great course
17743,Good Material with top instructor
17744,It was good
17745,Great course!

17747,Easy to understand and very nice relevant contents. May the lectures are delivered made it much easier to understand
17748,"Excellent course, chop full of practical advice and the scientifically understood reasons behind them. Not a long course either, but what an impact it has already made in my life! Any thanks Garb!!!"
17749,Simple and straightforward. Pollen does a great job.
17750,I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you. The professor is a great public speaker and very knowledgeable. I wish he was teaching another course.
17751,"A thorough introduction to the functional programming parts of Scala, with new topics introduced in a sensible order, justifications and explanations provided where expected, and assignment at an appropriate challenge level."
17752,Awesome course for beginners.
17753,Really Great
17754,Great course that gave me a new perspective on lesson planning and language teaching! Must have for teachers who want to develop their teaching skill!
17755,"Helpful tips, good advice."
17756,"Great course, the teacher did a very good job explaining a very difficult subject to a group of students with significantly different background.The quires were easy to solve once you took the time to see all the related video. There was a little bit of handholding in the programming assignment, but that may be due to the aforementioned background the student came up with.I'm a spanish speaking mechanical engineer with just a programming hobby and I was able to finish with a 99% grade. Of I could do it, anyone can"
17757,Only one star as it was not made clear you could also get 1/5 points in assignment noted as ties but no further explanation. I don't think I will bother with part 2
17758,"It was interesting, not tedious and very unfordable"
17759,"great course, compact and information!"
17760,"Thank you Roger, Brian, Jeff"
17761,"I am Rekha from Indonesia. During this session I learnt so many things which I was not aware of. For example our brain has two modes of learning focus and diffuse modes, about procrastinating, that it is when we skin some problems when we feel it hard , about reading, that it is not the correct way of learning. Recall the understands, deliberately practicing and repetition are the correct way to learn and memories. Thinking was so new to me. I never heard about it. The course was little difficult for me. However, I finished it successfully. I am happy that I got opportunity to improve and enhance my knowledge regarding how to learn. Thank you so much."
17762,Great course for non-programming people like me to start with!
17763,Brilliant!!!
17764,Informative and it is easy to understand
17765,"Moved the outline of the various areas where music has a strong effect: body, mind, psychic, relationships, community, and culture. I really enjoyed the video by Or. McFerrin. The provides excellent overview of the issues at hand. I also loved learning about the different perspective coming from presented from all over the world. His really enriched the overview of research in the field. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the title is very general and therefore a bit misleading. His course has a very strong Musical Therapy plant which is not obvious from the title. I was expecting to learn more about the scientific research about music on the general population (similar to Media Collins' approach or the research in Stay Worn's book ""Imperfect Harmony"", not in a therapeutic setting. Anyway, if the organiser change the title then participants will know better what to expect."
17766,Great course. Absolutely loved it. Thanks to Carry and Coursera for facilitating this. The approach was simple and interesting. The course has be instructed in a creative and easy to understand manner. The course material is very much superior.
17767,Very interesting.
17768,Dear teacher… you are the best because you brought out the best in us.
17769,Vice overview for those of us schooled in the language. Syntax of the notes and text is in need of major editing-proofreading.
17770,Or Chuck makes Great JOB!!! Thank you Or Chuck!
17771,"Although a bit in-your-face, the presentation is excellent. It combined the clarity of highly visible and easily audible, well-prepared material with a friendly informality. I especially like the paper-and-charpie technique."
17772,It is one of the latest programming language
17773,Great contents and better professor
17774,Insightful and effective material; great facilitators.The sessions were a little less engaging in between because the facilitators didn't talk to/engage the user but were talking between them.
17775,Fascinating explanations of how our brain works when learning. Highly recommended!!
17776,"Prof. Andrew taught very well. His lecture started with basic example, which is very clear for every student. I don't have much computer science background but I can still learned well by following the instructions."
17777,Good overview and gave me all the cards to do thing by myself
17778,"Enjoyed the course, it was a nice and simple introduction to effective technique for maximising output in the workplace"
17779,Good content but extremely basic
17780,I have loved this course as much as the first part. By work has dramatically improved by taking this course as my understanding of what I am doing has increased. Thank you for providing this specialization and I look forward to the next part.
17781,Well structures and information.
17782,"Awesome. Andrew G is an amazing instructor, the course has a strong technical basement supported by the path of the high school. All the concepts can be applied in the real world, as the instructor shows."
17783,"I always thought that the photo are in focus right real perfectamenet, without anything that moved.Today that capture the motion with my came is an artistic way of expressing my vision!"
17784,Great course! I learned a lot.
17785,"Great, been learning so much through this course. Highly recommended."
17786,Really helpful. One thing: the video in Couture weren´t able to watch
17787,I really joy making this course.
17788,"His is a good and effective course for managing your network and learning how to influence people. Any tactics are provided for earners, so we can try different ways in different situations to get a better influencing."
17789,"Moved every second this course, Prof.White is a truly professional and it`s been an honor to be his student even for a short period of time."
17790,"It is one of courses, independent of age, discipline, degree or subject is useful to everybody."
17791,Great course
17792,"Is a professional actor I knew the ability to write my own material would be an invaluable skill. I've been writing to/film ideas for years without a the slightest clue as to go about creating a full story in script form. Having no formal training, this class was the perfect introduction into the craft. Professor David Wheeler simplifies the intimidating feat of writing a to pilot into a realistically excitable series of steps. I will definitely be visiting this course in the future."
17793,His course is help full to managers and is fair in teaching skill. The picture quality is good and the real time examples are nicely explained. The course and syllabus is framed in a correct format. The course is very good for up coming stars.
17794,great and awesome
17795,"Very good course and teacher, specially about nations and staff and."
17796,His is the best course in getting the basic understanding of AngularJS. I really did get a lot out this course and I would highly recommend anyone for trying to learn angular. The organization and the layout of the course and also the professor explanation of the concept are really great!!
17797,Informative and sometimes fascinating.
17798,Great class !
17799,"Excellent! Not to be missed, it will change your life!"
17800,"Absolute amazing, I will recommend this course to all my friends!"
17801,too redundant
17802,A great introductory lesson for beginners in HTML.
17803,Andrew G is now my idol after this class :)
17804,"His course does a good job overall of framing the importance and challenges of working with big data, and certainly inspired me to want to learn more. However, I think the material could be organized better, and the lectures are not nearly the same quality as the universities' courses...not to mention too heavy on the PWC patches. The quires and assignment don't necessarily correlate well with the lessons, and the assignment are structures poorly. Based on my experience, I would not recommend a PWC course to serious earners."
17805,"Very interesting subject and well structures course, with good exposition of the subject. Looking forward into Part 2! Knocked one star off (would be half if I could) just because there is some discontinuity between the three sections/speakers and still a couple of rough edges to smooth out."
17806,Moved every moment of it
17807,"Excellent! Elucidate the definition of, value of, contributing factors to, and behavior leading to happiness. Further, it is not only philosophical, but evidence based. Both thought provoking and practical. Changed my attitude and approach to happiness."
17808,the course is great. also I would like to thank course for the fee-waiter opportunities without which people like me could never afford to take such high quality and up to date training!
17809,it's great and i knew what is calculus rather than doing thousands of problems i do frequently
17810,Excellent overview of the systems engineering methodology.
17811,Another great course in this specialization that shows how patron interact with database. Professor Chuck does a great job in explaining all the concepts and showing examples. I am already looking forward to the Capstone project.
17812,"the learning curve is quite steep, requires more than just mastering what the lecturer said."
17813,pretty good basic analysis technique of most common converted circuits.
17814,Vice and helpful course
17815,Great! I have really learned a lot by attending this course. Hope to see the AngularJS 2 or React course daytime soon :)
17816,I loved this course because it was simple and enjoyable. I could easily finish is alongside my choosing and extra things. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in a career with animals :)
17817,"His is a very inspire and deeply interesting course! All of parts architect are simple, competent and logical. After course i find many of my bad mistakes and i hope it helps me to be better and learn faster. Because we learn through all the life!I finished my university many years ago, but now i would learn by Barbara Early and Or. Senjowsky with pleasure. You are the great teachers! Thanks for learned me how to learn!with respect, Rouslan Boulatov, Moscow, Russia."
17818,"It's helps me a lot to identify my learning habits, especially the bad ones."
17819,"Like it. It gives me a big picture of of, tough I still weak of coming/implementation, but grab the concepts do helps me.Hope to reinforce myself in some advance and more practice course."
17820,"Very nice video, understandable language and a great teacher! Of you want to get more knowledge about design, it is a great course!"
17821,Very good! Vice knights about captivity in a practical way.
17822,"His course offers an insight to most of the machine learning technique currently deployed. However, it does not go in depth for any of it. Amazing programming exercises, very well structures, very helpful and easily understandable. They make sure that you only implement what is relevant to the course and all else clatter (reading, typechecking, etc) is already in place for you. The instructor is easily understandable and the presentations are very well structures. Coming from an engineering/computing background, would hope for more path and insight, but this is a course that can be taken by economics or other major. Really enjoyed it and has prepared me to delve deeper into machine learning and craft of systems as part of my school or in my free time."
17823,"Good course, I think Charles should avoid explaining the code so in detail sometimes that makes the course pace very slow"
17824,"It was a pleasure learning with Professor Thompson. It's a pity that ""Taking the Team"" and ""The Truth About Negotiations"" are not available for buying on goose play books."
17825,Challenging and very information
17826,His course has improved my understanding of how human brain works.
17827,"Excellent class, learned quickly and simply !"
17828,His will probably be the worst course in the specialization and for good reason. The entire course is designed to overcoat you with terminology to get you up to speed for the follow courses. Is a result this is a pretty bland and boring 4 weeks. The assignment feel like tedious filler an a lot of the questions in them are very poorly worded. The saving grace is that the course is just 4 weeks and can be completed in a fairly short amount of time.
17829,Good into to APIs
17830,Very well explanation.
17831,very insightful lectures and case practice. strongly recommended
17832,Great introductory course to cancer. I love how the course includes the clinical side as well as the biological implication of cancer and provides the information in a very simplistic style. The coursework is not overwhelming and I loved this course.
17833,Excellent course and teacher! Congratulations!!
17834,"I loved the way Andrew G exposed the concepts, without entering into much mathematical details. His course will leave in you a great foundation in machine learning, becoming easier to learn from now on. In conclusion, this course balances well enough the mathematical formalization, in a way that you grow accustomed to it, using it in your advantage sometimes. Thank you Andrew!"
17835,Learning a new language is really difficult. Thanks to course and the instructor they made this course so easy that any one can understand the concept of the programming and complexity of it very easily.Thank you course and special thanks to the instructor.
17836,It is great
17837,Essential for anyone interested in GIS and wants to get the basis. I really learnt a lot in a short space of time at my own pace. Brilliant convent.
17838,"Andrew G is very clear in his lecture. The assignment are well written. Most of all, this course inspires me to learn machine learning!"
17839,"Good to get a formal overview of all the phases and ingredient of data science projects, without getting lost in the details."
17840,Great course!
17841,wonderful course
17842,To far I've been reading and watching course material pretty much seriously. And I can tell from my experience that I've liked this course so much that I will give try to another courses down the stream.-Layer B
17843,"Great case study, but the way to engage the audience might have been way better. Assignment were individual and it was very difficult to use them at full power, because they were quite boring. Interaction with other earners would be very beneficial in a form of group assignment. Sides are very boring and useless in comparison to incredible content in the first 6 courses of the specialization. Capstone should have been done by the same (high) standards as other courses in specialization."
17844,"Great insight. However, the treatment of SVM (Support Sector Machines) was a bit too light for my tastes."
17845,Great introduction to Machine Learning.
17846,Very well presented and explained.
17847,Excellent course with good challenging assignment. It improves our understanding in designing complex webpages in a smooth and easier way. Recommended for everyone who are wishing to grow as a web developer.
17848,"A good course that I would recommend to everyone that want to follow a career in creative writing or to improve their passion.It helped me to acknowledge things that you have to take in account when writing a book.I could not imagine some of this things when I was thinking about an action,and,how to put it on paper and sound good for the reader.The assignment are very good and you can also complete them in audit only mode , but only for yourself , no one will revive you.It`s not that easy to write something when you don`t know much things about the structures , how to build a character and so on , but , here you have everything you need and it`s free.I finished the course in audit only mode but if you have the possibility to buy it , don`t hesitate."
17849,"Recent introduction to SEO field. Now level, introductory course."
17850,One of the most enlightening online classes I've yet experienced
17851,Very interesting and useful course!
17852,"Awesome course, love the professor!"
17853,"I didn't like this course as much. Mostly because the peer reviews were strict and forgiving and as an experienced, essay writer, I didn't feel I needed the rigid, boring academic structure required for this assignment. However, I made it through with a decent mark so I'm grateful for it."
17854,I like the course. Very well taught and provided us good amount of information in building projects on Scratch. Thank you.
17855,Good course . A must take for beginners !
17856,It is very helpful for a beginner like me. Prof. Chuck makes students both have broad views and know detail functions. Run to learn!
17857,"West professor and best material.Very useful to ones having no knowledge about private equity and venture capital except some basic knowledge. Of you have some basic finance knowledge and you interested in the topic, you should start to learn."
17858,Thank you very much for this course. I really enjoyed the level of the course. In particular the fact that a decent amount of research was needed to work on the assignment.A few issues with the programming assignment. Especially at the beginning. I am assuming this is because this is the first version that uses jupiter notebook.
17859,Excellent! Really helped me a lot. Thanks yakov :) May you get lot more colonies in your life :P
17860,"I found this course really fascinating. The key concepts, academic insight, exercises and assignment; all contributed towards real world and practical learning experience."
17861,Great course!
17862,"Great Course, great professor, great video and very very good content.Ve if you're not a beginner you should do this course to refresh your knowledge."
17863,"Excellent course, even the persons lacking the very basis of cryptography can understand."
17864,Proffesor Jogesh K. Muppala is probably the best instructor I have ever met in Coursera. He is active on discussions and really help us to understand the topic. He is also has a great sense of humor and his lecture video are magnificent. Good Work :)
17865,"The course is interesting, but the trading system needs to improve substantially. The grade bags considerably, and the questions are often not well defined, which requires a lot of unnecessary trial and error to understand what exactly the question was about. Finally, complete the assignment took way long that what it is suggested."
17866,Brilliant Course. Would recommend to anyone who wants to learn from scratch
17867,Great to get started!
17868,Hello everybody!the course is arranged so that every next class is expected with great anticipation.I enjoy every moment.Thank you very much.
17869,I have studied this course as part of the Executive Data Science Specialization. I think this set of four courses meet my objectives by providing a very nice overview on the key points of data science projects. They are good to give a flavor on data science and data science projects helping decide if you want to search for more in depth knowledge.
17870,A much much valuable course...
17871,Thank you
17872,Great course for someone whose starting out and no background of SEO whatsoever.
17873,"Changed my life, best course I've ever taken!"
17874,Great!!!
17875,"Amazing course in Finance for managers ,loved it.Specially the professor Tom's teaching style and amazing communication skill and detailing of the concepts.Will recommend every manager to take this course and save hell lot of money in going other colleges and spending huge money.In experience to cherish!!Thanks professor Thomas smith !!"
17876,"The course gives an general theoretical overview about nutrition, but not goes further into details or practical example."
17877,"Great information, innovative format, humorous presentation, of credits. His is a GREAT course."
17878,Important basic information...
17879,Good basic foundation of HTML and CSS.It will help if the trading public needs to be more flexible in order to assess smaller outcome. I found it too binary to be of use for accurate assessment.
17880,Thank you. Very interesting course.
17881,Very insightful.
17882,The course contents are composed of some superficial concepts of cloud computing. And the code framework for programming assignment written in c++ is probably the worst kind of code I've ever seen.
17883,I really enjoy study this class!
17884,"Very good introduction to Hands Series and DataFrames for Data Science. Last paced course with good supplementary materials. The homework is progressively challenging. Sophie the Reaching Assistant is particularly helpful in the forms. I don't recommend this course for those without programming or patron scraping experience. Also, the homework exercises took me significantly longer than the estimates projected, but I budget about double the time and was able to complete the course on time."
17885,Extremely beneficial if you work in education!
17886,wonderful instructor
17887,"Great exercises. By only complaint is the last 2 weeks, the instructor weren't visual enough. They kept using hand gestures and not enough concrete visualizations of some of the steps. There were a lot of concrete visualizations for the big ideas... but not enough for all the different material and intermediary steps they were trying to teach."
17888,"excellent course, content and professor. Very enlightening material delivered very digestibly."
17889,Great course for starting working with of in patron. Good portion of theory and practice.
17890,The lessons contain brief explanation even if this is an introduction study only. There are a lot of key things and terms to remember (that are mostly hard to comprehend if you do not have marketing knowledge) which I also believe are necessary in further B2B market study.of. I like the funny introduction and side comments of Prof. Hang.
17891,A very good introduction to Algorithmic technique. Well worth the cost of entry!
17892,The lessons and explanations were very interesting and easy to understand.
17893,"Great course! The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is that assignment are too easy. Of we can resolve some real problems, that will be better."
17894,Great course!
17895,Great one!
17896,"A good course, giving a thorough understanding of the various types of renewal energy, their issues and opportunities. I cannot rate the course higher because some of it is so out of date. It really needs to be re-done. The Paris Agreement wasn't mentioned, some of the research is from the early 2000s, many of the lectures are at least 3 years old. His is an area that is changing rapidly, monthly, and this course can't really be seen to be current any more. Particularly the politics section in week 8."
17897,His is a great course. Gentle on the beginner but very robust content.
17898,I love this course.
17899,"It's still a good series of courses, and now they are breaking down the lectures into shorter chinks. That makes it easier to download and easier to manage my study time.The sides and screenviews are still hard to see. Tiny purple text on a black background just *does*not*work*.Up to week 2 I'm finding the explanations are not deep and detailed enough, and the assignment are too easy and superficial.But I guess that's of, it's a short course and it gives you a quick overview of a bunch of different technologies. It is very good at that."
17900,"Reliable, good for people who still need to find their first position in the industry"
17901,"Wonderful... just love how much there's to learn. Love the exposition the data, how it was developed. The perfect timing of the sound and english subtitles.Excellent professor.I will enjoy to more Paleontology courses"
17902,"It's a good course and learnt many things and the expert Or. Wooldridge has awesome skill in teaching, an expert touch. Good course good teaching. But I thought available and available energy nodules will also be there, that was missing. Except that, it's wonderful."
17903,"I learned and enjoyed this course, I feel confident in my future writing and with the knowledge on how to continue. I am thankful for this opportunity"
17904,good tips for testing experiments
17905,Great!
17906,Rough course! Very close to being in a classroom with plenty of material in every video. Deep a book on the topic handy and you will understand the material better.
17907,"Excellent course, very good examples and perfect approaches !´m really satisfied.!"
17908,I think this course it is fundamental for give to student a perfect basis for learn to programming and knowledge of science amputation.
17909,"Pollen is everything that's right with the world, I can't say enough good things."
17910,Excellent course and great study material
17911,"UVA and Garden are the best. UVA and Garden are not ranged as the top public university and best public business school in the world by several major publications for nothing. I've even studied at Harvard and UVA is way better IMO, plus a nicer camps."
17912,Very well structure and developed I started with JavaScript but find this language much more friendly for beginners like me.Congratulations to the faculty.
17913,I enjoy all the information. thanks
17914,A very good summary that will help you to navigable in the future of technique.
17915,Everything is good from the teaching. The Only Problem I faced is with the Jupiter. Rode works fine in my Computer but the Vernal dies in the Jupiter. I also had a problem in importing some functions in Jupiter.
17916,"Very good course for understanding HTML, CSS, of.Now we can add russian subtitles"
17917,I loved the first course by professor Chamovitz and I loved this one. His passion for plant biology is inspiring. I hope for more courses by him.
17918,His course was very information and helped to solidity the knowledge that I had coming into the course. I would recommend this course to anyone from novice to expert.
17919,Good course helpful in realizing mistake you may make as you get more occupied in schedule
17920,"It was great ,and is very useful to me."
17921,Very much enjoying the course so far! Am glad this topic is so well handled.
17922,There is quite a bit of material within this course. Having the supplementary book and Princeton online material helped substantially especially when debugging the assignment.
17923,"Straightforward, interesting, and easy to follow. I wish it were a bit more challenging."
17924,"A great refreshed to the calculus from high school, and then some."
17925,Excellent course for understand the 'why' for the basic elements of CSS.
17926,Challenging and totally recommended!
17927,Must amusing. I love this course!
17928,"The lectures were too wordy and the lectures tripped over their words too often (which wouldn't have made it so difficult to listen if the lectures hadn't been so wordy!). There was too much focus on high-level details of the course project and too little attention paid to technical details. His rendered the lectures simplistic, boring, and sometimes a waste of time. His felt like an introductory level course, made more difficult through poor teaching.Also, the sick web interface was slightly difficult to navigable in comparison to other Coursera courses."
17929,Barbara - you are amazing! That an incredible resource you have put together and shared with the world!! I'm now a HUGE fan of anything that you do!
17930,Great
17931,"Assignment are extremely helpful in fully understanding the topic. Lectures help in completing assignment, especially with the optional video that explain in greater detail how to examine specific bones and interpret certain patterns."
17932,Very useful!
17933,well explained. It would be more good if an entirely new worksheet is given for work at the end of course
17934,Improvement over the first course. Most of the material did not require many references to the apple documentation in order to complete the assignment. Final project was comprehensive and built on previous work. A major flaw of this course is that it is not updated for the newest version of Swift. Any of the technique and methods taught will not translate to Swift 3.0.
17935,"I like how the course was structures, it made it easier to absorb all the historical comparisons of instruction methods."
17936,"Of there were more stars, I would have selected them. Highly recommend this course!"
17937,Good course. Especially enjoyed the crowdsourcing lectures.
17938,Complicated mathematical concepts explained in a very simple way.
17939,Great course!
17940,Prof. Lava's courses are amazing and easy to comprehend. Finished two courses of Prof. Lava. Thanks for the knowledge sir.And
17941,"Fantastic, fun, educational, and indeed, sharp."
17942,Using Mind Caps to explain can be a lot more easier!
17943,"His was a very well done course with many different ways to practice the skill being taught. There are a few bags in the assignment section, particularly in week 4, that impacted students' ability to review one another' work."
17944,very useful
17945,His is the third or fourth time I've reviewed this course but it still keeps asking me to
17946,"I am writing to thank professor Michael for his great course. I considered this class one of my favorite courses. His class honestly gave me a new understanding of the world. His lectures were always so well organized, and easy to understand.His excellent teaching skill helped me a lot.I learned so much from professor Michael and I look forward to learning more. Any thanks for being a remarkable teacher .best regards, And In Madam"
17947,"The course is so great for the beginners who want to know about the machine learning.Is a beginner, I learned a lot from from this course and the enter.Thank you!"
17948,"I liked the assignment, and the course... for the most part. That I didn't care for was so much time being spent on the IBM BlueMix and other software tutorials. I don't really see the value in those software, and it felt very sales pitch-y. I can't imagine using them in my day to day, so it just felt like a waste of time. But I did like all other aspects of this course, including the Face Well insight, as well as the details on Social Mention and the other free web applications that is more permanent to future social work."
17949,Excellent course! A real challenge! It is awesome when you apply what you have learned!
17950,The teaching approach is nice and followable.The course materials are understandable.It's provides a good basis in programming.
17951,I think the level was a bit on the low side and the time i had to spend on each week was far less compared with the first module. Sides maintain high standard.
17952,"Amazing course. I learnt everything I wanted (and needed) to know about the basis of good nutrition. I loved how the course doesn't just give you general information but also practical tips to shop, cook and eat better. I feel that I gained knowledge but also the ability to apply this knowledge in my everyday life, which is very empowering. Is a social scientist, I appreciated the effort put in addressing socioeconomic factors affecting people's diet. To me, the course was complete and thorough its its objectives, and the great quality video were very enjoyable to watch. I could tell that there was a team of professional who put their passion and skill behind each one of them."
17953,Excellent initial overview course for people without a knowledge of the Arctic or Environmental Science.
17954,great course
17955,"I enjoyed the course. The available teaching materials and presentations were very good and helped me better understand the sustainable concepts and initiatives carried out in the countries of Scandinavia and that can serve as examples for other countries, especially developing countries like Brazil.tvillarim@email.com"
17956,Great course!! Very practical and useful!! Thanks for putting it together!!
17957,"It is fantastic course, helped me learn new and powerful technique for learning. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and expertise to students like us. Thanks for this MOOC as many would not have the opportunity to meet you guns or study with you in college to learn these technique. His online course has solved the problem."
17958,very professional
17959,Vice course and all the chapters are well explained.
17960,"Great course. I am learning a lot so far, onto Week 2!"
17961,really feasible for engineers!!!!!!!!! awesome!!!!
17962,Very visual lessons explaining step by step how to code in SWIFT. Of those that do not speak portuguese can easily follow this course. I would recommend that nations in English are added to this course or the instructor presents it in English.
17963,"His course really helped me to come up with a great weight loss plan. I know the hard part is still in front of me, but I feel more confident now than I ever have embracing on a weight loss journey."
17964,Very interesting course. Well explained. Some basic banking knowledge might be necessary.
17965,Great Introductory to Machine Learning and a great way to learn it by implementing Machine Learning algorithms.
17966,A bit thin on the psychology. References are not hard to find and post in Resources.
17967,Very useful and effective in learning english.
17968,I loved this course! Definitely try it out!
17969,Definitely helped me understand my dog (and others) in a much more thorough/politic way
17970,"A Very Good overview of the ""Fundamentals"".One feels like they have all the information they need to start managing after completion.The Questions are fairly simple but the Content is Meaningful.Overall, I got a lot out of it, it's an enjoyable introduction to management."
17971,Extremely comfortable way to learn. I have some machine learning background from a university course 10 yes ago so this course was a super way to refresh and learn new concepts. Programming exercises could be made a larger part of the course. Or add more optional programming exercises.
17972,Excellent format and path from the beginning to the end. Martin Tender provides a great learning experience based on real-life examples and forces you to put your knowledge into a bigger perspective.
17973,Instructor is really good giving lectures. History suddenly seems full of fun and power
17974,"It is an excellent course, really happy to learn with it"
17975,"Very good course, with clear explanations of the key concepts. However, I felt hindered in being able to complete all tasks in the homework each week as many questions alienated someone like me with little mathematics/physics background. I feel if the questions were more general I would have been able to perform better each week. Very good lecture content though."
17976,"Well, while I felt really frustrated after having played ALL of this course video, I have first put very negative comments here for its reviewing. I have then been kindly asked to reconsider my comments under the light of the usefulness of this course to some audience. For sure, it might be that I was not of the attended audience. And I still think that this course was of no interest to me - this is the reason why I'm still pleased not to have paid for its useless certificate. Nevertheless, this course might be of interest for some students. His is definitely true. To, let me suggest a new title for it: ""Design and Take Infographics for the Summits"". Because that's it! His course is definitely perfect for the ones who know nothing about Infographics and they might enjoy it. Finally, I shall neither modify nor remove my previous comments on the examples used by the author.Please notice that Coursera still gets all my confidence about the usefulness and the quality of their proposed courses. For instance, just have a look to the course ""Machine Learning"" of one of its co-founders, Andrew G.------------------------------------By previous comments here below:For sure I was not the correct audience for this course. But nothing useful to be learned in here. Karl Rude is too much speaking of what he has formerly done, which is of only interest to him. I dislike the examples he uses : violence, sex, illness, accidents, weapons, war, drugs - and fruits, ok. Are these the only topics of interest to him? Finally, it appears that the $45 certificate does not worth it. I'm pleased not to have paid for it. And I definitely not recommend this course. Haste of time if not even waste of money."
17977,"Great course to gather a politic view of the industry, clearly explained, engaging, great tutor (awesome stories), perfect for those who want to gain insight into this field."
17978,His is very useful with the
17979,It's really excellent! The course helps me a lot! Thank you.
17980,"Easy to follow. Right be too easy for some people with experience in data analysis. However, the instructor also talk about some framework and insight from their experience which could be helpful even for those who have some prior experience."
17981,Very Vice Course!
17982,Very good those who want make their career in business analysis field
17983,"Great mental lookout. Well-explained, but the coming challenges and bonus questions are challenging enough to allow for a lot of growth even for more advanced students."
17984,Great course with good instructor.
17985,"Great contents as the rest of the courses in the specialization. I'm afraid I need to be a little bit critical with this one though:1) The contents are really jammed into 4 weeks - The last week's contents are actually some kind of miscellany between mongoose, http, authentication and BaaS2) Not a single quit or self-evaluation of sorts along the course - To be completely fair, the exercises shown along the way might make up for it. Still, I think it's important to spread some quires around so as to make absorb the concepts more effectively) The quality of the presentations is somewhat lower than other courses. There's even a video towards the end of the course where a Linkedin ratification springs up on top, which even makes the presented pause for a few seconds.On't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this course and definitely appreciate the effort put into it - Given the newly introduced Coursera fees, I'd expect much more quality in place to make it 70 buck-worth, though"
17986,Great course for an introduction
17987,His is pretty exciting.
17988,5/5 if there were more pictures and diagram of the methods while they were talking to better visualized.
17989,Great and complete course in getting to know of by interlacing with the Arduino!
17990,"Great course, I've learned a whole lot!"
17991,Very detailed introduction and instruction on this topic! I have learned the basic elements needed for game developing from this course.
17992,Very good course and lectures
17993,"Its a great course. Even if it's a basic of the Trophic Design, it's pretty detailed and a good start to anyone interested in the subject."
17994,I really learn a lot of useful skill from the teacher in the vi
17995,I really enjoy learning from Professor Bias Kretschmer. He has all these interesting drops related to the examples that always grab my attention and make me laugh. His course is suitable not only for those who want to learn more about strategy but also for those who are beginners to the business world. I'll definitely start the advanced one soon!
17996,Or. Andrew taught the material very clearly!
17997,"It was very helpful, well directed and precise! Thanks for the great learning experience."
17998,Great set of mind and heart tools to develop
17999,good powerful insight into statistics. Thanks!
18000,His is an awesome course to understand the fundamentals behind developing a good learning skill.
18001,His is probably the best course I have taken on Coursera. I have always been a voracious reader of books on modern history but never studied it or taken a course. Thank you course for making such an awesome course available to people all over the world.I must also say that Or Philip Zelikow has structures the course very well and the load is not too heavy. Thank you Or Philip for opening up your course to the world.
18002,"Very nice course. However, the final project is not very close to the course content. Still, it is very well double thanks to the very helpful tutor / enter."
18003,"It is very interesting course, everything understandable. Sick is excellent teacher."
18004,Very insightful. Highly recommended for anyone who is new to hotel revenue management. A good foundation course for hotel marketing and distribution.
18005,"The course is good, but in my opinion, it's too basic for people who are already developer (in platforms other than in). Hopefully the next course in the series will be a little bit deeper."
18006,Great course. It really re-united my interest in history.
18007,"It is a gorgeous course!!! It has helped me to modify the way I was learning and has also shown me my errors and how to change them.Totally worthy!!!!!Barbara,you have changed my life!Thank you!"
18008,His is one of my favourite course! I recommend it!
18009,"Excellent course. Learned a lot of things about fundamentals of GIS. Thanks to Sick Wants, of Davis and Coursera Community."
18010,I really loved this course. It was quite interesting course and I learned a lot from it. It kept me engaged throughout the course.
18011,Course could be a little more challenging but it is pretty much up-to-date and very well presented
18012,His course was very interesting. It gave me many things to think about as I prepare to become a teacher. I liked the different articles and I now have different ways to think about teaching and learning.
18013,"His course is very good. Also, the teacher is very good and eloquent."
18014,Unfortunately we can not submit our tasks with do In upgrade in our account.
18015,"It has made a lot of fun, only what I didn't like, that in this course GraphLab is used. He do not use it in my company, so I would prefer to use Open Source Software packages and not one what has to be bought."
18016,"His course was information. I especially loved the interview with Russie from Face Well. I feel like I learned a lot from her. The only part I did not enjoy from this course was the Beer to Beer assignment. On't get me wrong, the assignment was very information. I love the concept of peer to peer assignment because I get to learn so much more in different sector. However, socialmention.com was NOT working for me. It was very slow and I could not even load the page. I had to go to a cafe with high speed internet in order to load my keywords, hashtags, and influences, but I couldn't until the last day (which is why I handed in my assignment late). Other than that, this course was (probably) better than the first one."
18017,"Very good introduction to the field. Not too complex, so a good starting point."
18018,"Very condensed yet accessible material. Great invitation for further, more deep dive studies!"
18019,I'd expected it to be more difficult.
18020,Good into. Very motivation.
18021,Learning how to learn has a fundamental importance
18022,The Professor is very humorous and the class is very interesting
18023,Great teacher! Not's of into and knowledge!
18024,The teacher is very kind and humorous. The whole set of video is elegant. By gratitude!
18025,His is a best class I joined in course whit high quality of sound and method of teachingtnx
18026,His module covers all the basic and yet very important information to be able to set your goal/priorities right everyday. Planning and making an estimate with the task for the day helps me to identify what I need to do first. Knowing what is multitasking and how to be effective in delivering several task at the same time.Thank you for all additional nodules and video.
18027,Perfect fantastic!
18028,Vice learning course
18029,To instructor participates in discussion. To one ever passes the programming assignment because it won't accept any answer.
18030,Gained hands on knowledge in Fig Data and current Data Analysis
18031,It's really a good course to take a first step in project management
18032,"Good, precise, relevant course. Course video along with assignment is really helpful. Tutor is simply perfect, well planned. Really helpful and useful in day to day professional life."
18033,"I'd highly recommend this course to anyone starting out in Machine Learning, or to anyone in need of a comprehensive memory refreshment on topics covered in here."
18034,I love this course
18035,it's too much basic stuffs.
18036,"great course, could be better if there more practice ."
18037,For a developing manager this has some great insight to help you work to become a great manager in this changing environment.
18038,A bit less engaging than the other parts of the Executive Data Science course.
18039,i need Chinese caution
18040,Very good course. Well prepared and full of useful basic information for young negotiations ;)
18041,awesome just it
18042,it was a great course.
18043,Great!
18044,Very good course. Gives you good tips to improve your learning capacity.
18045,Perfect course
18046,Really very good but basic introduction to the Python programming language.
18047,Very interesting and useful course
18048,very good training.
18049,"Excellent, can be little advanced."
18050,I have not taken Statistics 101 and Probability Theory 101 since college. His course was a great refreshed course for review! I highly recommend this course as a refreshed/review course to jump into real-world-application courses down the road.
18051,Great courses! Challenging but rewarding!
18052,"To useful for Project Manager, you should take this course and learn sap."
18053,"Thank you, It was such a great experience, I learned a lot."
18054,Excellent!Head the book with the lectures.Inspirational. Thought provoking. Informative. Challenging.Enjoy :)Enemy KMS and Community College Path Instructor
18055,Perfect!
18056,I loved this course. It helped me very much and I'm grateful for everything I learned here.The only thing I think need to be improved is the evaluation system.An't wait for my next course!
18057,"Interesting content, great stuff for every parent."
18058,"His was a good introduction to Coursera for me. Some of the information I already knew, but it was good to learn the ""why"" behind some of it. There were a few of the quires that contained questions from video that hadn't been covered yet. Her information about food galleries was good, I would like to see her offer a class on just that topic."
18059,His is a very difficult course
18060,"Very structures and organize Course , You will have a great time learning with Sick Wants !"
18061,Perfect!
18062,"very helpful course on fundamental elements of machine learning, and Andrew does a great job articulating ideas without overwhelming path. Great experience learning machine learning on Coursera!"
18063,North the knowledge. Notes were fun to take. Strongly Reccomend
18064,"Moved the course video and lectures were entertaining. I was a bit disappointed with the outright dismissal of non-traditional understanding of these ancient monuments and thought the explanations on why and how they were built, were lightly treated.A great course ..."
18065,Really great instruction...this is the course if you are new to programming. I completely understood the foundation of programming and patron.
18066,"His class was extremely helpful with teaching some of the most basic learning skill we never learned growing up. He've all been put in school and told to go learn but we were never taught how to learn! Thanks to both the professors aid input and tips on tickling tough material, I now feel much more confident heading into any type of course of program of study."
18067,Moving it!
18068,"It's a very good course, I learned a lot and enjoyed it a lot too"
18069,"Great course! Have me a very strong knowledge of the machine learning fundamentals, which letter me understand harder topics."
18070,"Is a pediatric oncologist, I have not had to deal with either lung or esophageal cancers.The use of endoscopic analysis for determining lymph node involvement was quite an eye-opened.Likewise, the immunologic histochemical variation was a valuable learning experience as were thepathologic descriptions of adenoma variant.The only possible criticism might be the thoracic surgeons use of acronyms without explanation, buttons was minor.Buds to the teamGratefully Herald Vladimir of"
18071,"An't wait for Cryptography 2, excellent course, fantastic professor."
18072,helpful
18073,Excellent Course !Easy to understand! Love Or. Chuck!
18074,"To far , very interesting and covers much of the material that was covered in my Strategy Course in my MBA. It has been a delightful course as a refreshed and putting more up-to-date examples than when I covered much of this material some time ago. Have another 2.5 weeks to go but I will look for more courses from LMU & Bias !"
18075,"Horrible. His course is too fun, too short, and a big tease. The discussion forum is congenial and academically stimulating. I hope it leads to a follow-up continuation."
18076,"For what it was, it was a decent course. For some reason I thought it would be a little more advanced. His was a very basic class. Wording of the last assignment limited creativity as it was hard to tell if you had to limit your pictures to 2 shapes,(as in one circle and one square), or 2 shapes(as in as many circles as needed and as many triangles as you needed, but don't add any squares). Reviewing these assignment, because they were so basic, made it hard to offer much in the way of constructive criticism."
18077,"A really interesting course, and also, basic and simple. The lectures are a little fast though. I hope I would continue this course if I have time."
18078,Awesome experience after getting snapped with Or.Dan Beget's thoughts and amazing lectures. His course changed my spiking pattern entirely!!
18079,"Information was very useful, but some of the content was difficult to understand due to the heavy accents."
18080,A very interesting way to do a lot of things without a very few code!
18081,"I liked the professor very much, and the expert interviews were interesting. In the other side, she used a lot of articles from the internet which gave not much knowledge. I think it would be better to use more material from professional manual, not from ""trend"" webster."
18082,Enjoyed the content and examples through the moves
18083,It worth every minute... Take a look you'll like too.
18084,"His is truly a course for EVERYBODY! To bidding. Now can you be a student or life long learner and not learn how to learn? West of all, it is exciting but also challenging in the sense that you will be hearing some things for the very first time. Welcome."
18085,"I love this course! Especially with the practice exercises. His course has helped me significantly improve my understanding & the technical skill revolving data warehousing. It would be much better though, if this course has a lot more technical exercises, learning how to utilize essential data warehousing tools efficiently."
18086,"Too much theory, too little real life examples."
18087,"Practical advice rooted in understandable explanations of scientific findings, with a lot of opportunities to dig deeper in necessary literature. Excellent course, highly recommended."
18088,great course! I enjoyed it! Thanks!
18089,His is a great course!
18090,Thank you
18091,The instructor give beautiful explanations which make course fun and double.
18092,Absolutely awesome course for beginners :)
18093,"The teacher reaches in a formal yet enjoyable manner. He is far better than any other teacher that I have ever seen, even in real life. He reaches with a balanced mix of enthusiasm and explanation. By only trouble during this course was being unable to log into mooculus.ou.ed."
18094,Very interesting course. thank you
18095,"The best introductory course for Python, especially for those who has zero programming knowledge. Or. Charles Severance is the best. Hope to learn more from him."
18096,"A great course, learned a lot but due to not being in a position to purchase the certificate of could not submit quires or assignment, such a shame as I could not get feedback"
18097,Excellent. Completely changed how I perceive the world.
18098,Great introductory course to Clinical Trials.
18099,By only wish is that I had taken this course in high school.
18100,Good course. Had arrangement!
18101,"Absolutely great start for statistics with R. Not too heavy in time, not too light. Amazingly curate course."
18102,"Great gentle introduction to ActiveRecord, and by the end of the course you feel like you can create pretty much any webapp."
18103,"I learned this machine learning course. His is my second course about machine learning.Gros. [1] Mathematical background are well introduced. Of their proof is quite long, the proof is omitted. [2] His course provides chance to construct major machine learning formula using MATLAB/Active. [3] Resources offered at last seem to be very useful to deepen my study on machine learning. I am going to use the references as a compass.Sons. [1] Studio quality is poor. Is an English learner as a second language, this makes me spend more time to capture the meaning of speech. [2]"
18104,Amazing course! It helps you look at the world with a whole new perspective!
18105,Great
18106,"Of I wasn't already familiar with statistics, I would find the lectures and course book difficult to follow. Of future revisions to the course are made, consider including a cheat sheet with the rotation, parameter abbreviations used, etc. It would also be helpful to write (or at least include a reference back to) the equation being used in the example calculations instead of immediately filling numbers in."
18107,"Vague content, quit and programming assignment not exactly related to video lecture content."
18108,"Or. Chuck is a brilliant teacher. The Python for Everybody Specialization is perfect for absolute beginners. Between the video lectures and the textbook, I was able to practice each concept until it made sense to me. I have absorbed a phenomena amount of vocabulary without feeling overwhelmed. Or. Chuck has boasted my confidence that I can learn this new skill, enjoy every moment of the process and... dare I suggest... get a job!"
18109,"Very interesting,The teacher is very clear and it s nice to lesson to him."
18110,"Amazing course, everything you need to know about network calls and security. 5/5"
18111,"Excellent introduction into the subject. A lot of theory and practical illustrations. Surely, to master the material entirely you should practice for years. But the course gives a thorough overview of what the blue means. Of you don't learn how to play it you at least will understand what happens there. By only critics is that I did not found any written materials that are used in the lectures. I don't understand why. I used the printscreen button to get examples from the video. Would not it be much easier to include the music sheets that are disposed publicly anyway."
18112,Engaging course with a lot of information.
18113,"Great, excellent information. Very hope"
18114,Great it was
18115,Very helpful
18116,reasonable difficulty levels and speed
18117,Simply great course! Highly recommended!
18118,"Great course, I learned very interesting keys and skill."
18119,Awesome course and awesome prof!!! I learned so much. Thank you!
18120,Great explanations and very good assignment.
18121,"Really, fantastic and helpful course.Thanks Coursera and University of California."
18122,A must take course. Really useful knowledge.
18123,I enjoyed everything in the this set of nodules
18124,"Excellent course and nice instructor, keep it up good work....."
18125,"His was my first MOOC course and I must say, It was a wonderful experience. Andrew is a brilliant teacher. The course is very well designed and the programming exercises are really fun to do. Thank You Andrew and Coursera Team!"
18126,"I loved this course, mainly due to our wonderful Professor. He focused on very permanent subjects in Psychology (I felt like we covered the highlight of a whole year worth of subjects in 10 weeks) AND he did it in a very engaging and fun way. In a nutshell, he is AWESOME!That I did not like, which is also why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is mainly due to organisational matters:1) the course schedule does not follow the weeks as listed in Coursera which creates TOTAL confusion, and it can be very easily solved. It the very least, the mid-term and final exam should be placed after the correct weekly schedule. Right now it is shifted by a week (earlier)2) The instructions about the peer assignment were not fully clear. I think also there, this is a quick fix and quick win. Simply adjusting the wording to better explain the process would help reduce questions on the forum.3) There was almost no staff involvement in the forum. The responses were very far in between, which also made the forum discussions not as lively or exciting. I would have loved having the professor himself on the forum, or at least one of his assistants in the forum, sparkling discussions, responding to threads etc. His was almost on extent.To in short, I would highly recommend the course due to its content! But I also feel that there are organisational improvements, which if made, would make this course a true 5 star course!"
18127,i have b.a in accounting from an Egyptian university and i found in this course all i needed
18128,"I've just finish this course and it is the last one for me in the series of the paleontology courses provided by University of Albert. And I must say, I'm simply blown away by all these courses! The topics covered are absolutely fascinating, the material presentation exceeded all my expectations and Scott Persons, the presented, is probably the most engaging teacher I've ever seen, absolutely perfect at holding attention and delivering the material.I liked the way the course is structures - individually following the evolutionary tree of all three major groups. It's really interesting to see how evolution worked out for them.The material itself isn't short of terminology so it's treats listeners seriously, providing witty-gritty details of how the evolution process took place, I really appreciate that. And it's never everyone, so a person without a special knowledge background can go through course just fine. Although it won't hurt to start these courses with In 101 first :)Interactive materials are a very nice touch and a welcome addition to excellent video and great lecture notes. Moved the use of fossil as well, it's a joy to get a look at some treasures a university like this has in their possession.Hopefully, the staff behind these courses will be able to find an opportunity and new topics to continue to share knowledge about that mesmerizing time of prehistoric life. Until then, many thanks to all of them!"
18129,Really well done.
18130,His is a nice slow introduction to patron web programming for those who have no experience or prior knowledge. Otherwise it is not at all challenging.
18131,"Great course. Must what I needed as a beginner in writing lyric. I've been singing/playing/producing, but never really try to write lyric. His course opens up the subject and gives you the opportunity to understand that writing lyric is a craft."
18132,"Brilliant course and the senators are simply superb. Excellent content with perfect articulation . A big thanks to all of you.Arm regards,Makeev"
18133,Sides were a little slow. I would prefer more sides and actual information to memories and then video as an option to hear opinion and real time experience.
18134,Great class! Great materials. Thanks so much.
18135,"I have to say thanks to both teachers, who teach me a lot of things useful for my career."
18136,Very fun and easy to get into
18137,Excellent introduction to the language.
18138,It superb
18139,"His courses touches many interesting aspects about R programming but I did not like the structure , it does not seem to me that it adequate its difficulty coming from ""The R programming environment"".Also I miss some will lessons for many of the reading from the book. There are not too many help from the senators and the peer assignment in week 4 took me too much time and had to consult a lot of external resources. Headings in general are of but too simple.I have learnt many things but"
18140,"A great course for the beginners!!! And a good and funny professor at the helm of the course!!! A really good experience for the students!!! Thank you, sir!!!"

18160,thank you
18161,"Beautifully delivered, made it easy to understand material that was new to me. I highly recommend"
18162,Good Course but slightly schizophrenic due to the object tormented topics. On't feel that they belong in this course and would be really picked off if paid for it.
18163,"The course gave a great insight into how to learn. There are certain technique that I've already been using, but many of them were new to me. The explanation of why some methods work and some don't was extremely clear.Thank you for this great course, I will gladly use the lessons learned in my future learning."

18169,Great start for students seeking Web development
18170,"A very good introduction, especially starting with SQL"
18171,"I liked the course a lot. I was impressed by Or German's passion to quantitative research methods (though sometimes his vivid gesticulations and jumping distracted me from the material). Assignment were quite useful for understanding of course concepts, though they took a lot of time."
18172,"Very organized and detailed about the basic, history, characteristics of typography.I really enjoyed it and wish there were other courses by the same lecturer.Thanks for the great course!!"
18173,Very great introduction (and it s coming from someone with 0 computer skill)
18174,His is great
18175,"Very practical, great exercise, easy to understand and follow through, the student doesn’t need major computer programs or high quality technology in order to complete each assignment. The design of each assignment is made to use your imaginations, hands on tools and materials. Love the video, clear, to the point beautiful made. Lots of room to work and do something quite good and unique if the student want! I am really having fun!Thank you!"
18176,I really like the content of this course and the quality of the reading. The video are intuition and help you go through the most important concepts. I definitely recommend it! And big thank you to the teachers that delivered high standard course!
18177,Informative and practical use of Security design
18178,In amazing tool for entrepreneurs
18179,"Instructor seems like a genuinely invested teacher who provides plenty of resources, points you in the right direction in considering how to approach a client meeting, and provides in-depth explanations for what you need to know and do. A few of the later more advanced concepts really relied on students to follow along and type themselves, and you will want both notes and comments in your code to help you remember the important details (<!-- --> in HTML or /* */ in CSS). His combined with one or two other HTML/CSS/JavaScript Resources provides a comprehensive introduction to web design, though! Must be sure to allow yourself time to learn, absorb, practice, and work on the assignment. Plug into the community with detailed information when you have questions and you will be fine! :D"
18180,The course is well organized and touch on topics that matter in the real world.
18181,His course has good interactivity)
18182,"The lectures weren't always easy to follow but the quires were really useful as they meant it was necessary to understand the material. Definitely a useful course, I will be interested to see how it relates to the real world of derivatives pricking."

18191,really great!
18192,"Great lectures, poor challenges"
18193,"In excellent course, I learned pretty good tips to improve my understanding on how I learn, it is still a day by day process to get use to, but it is fun and encouraging to know our minds always have the opportunity to grow."
18194,"Incredible Resources, But A It Monotonous Which Sucks But The Enthusiasm To Complete The Course. But Take To Mistake, His Is One Brilliant Course And You *MUST* Cry His To Understand The Universe Round You A Little Letter."
18195,Very good course. Social media could have been an additional topic.
18196,His one is more labor intensive than the other courses but worth it. I learned a lot.
18197,Well structures introduction to programming. Of you want to try out coming this is a great place to start.
18198,"I am hopeful that the information I've learned in this course will show its usefulness in the future. I feel that the course could've been organized a little better (and if I had it to do over I would check out the Leading a Case very early on in the course.) Is a teacher, I am disappointed at the public that is given because students are trading each other and may not know what an ""average"" response is I feel that the public should be better structures to help give a more objective grade."
18199,"Excellent course, Very highly recommend it! His is my first course in Coursera and what a surprise, it was great! Well explained, concise and the professor is excellent. His class is A+"
18200,It was a great experience and a very good course. The instructions were clear and very interesting.
18201,a good and information course.
18202,Good course to introduce Python
18203,Very Informative Course ....
18204,"Even knows his stuff and shares valuable insight. Overall, it was well-information."
18205,His is one of the best courses I have ever take in thinking.
18206,"His course helps me much in real life. It improves my negotiation skill in many situations of life.But I think it has a little bit much of's law, it is not really helpful for everybody, but some specific region."
18207,"I really enjoyed this online course)I gained a lot of knowledge, which I can apply in teaching sphere and other fields.Thank you very much to Coursera and MoMA Team! :-)"
18208,Incredible
18209,I really enjoyed this class. Introduced me to a number of concepts I hadn't heard of before and I found the experiments interesting.
18210,"I love writing, and even if English is not my mother tongue this course is enjoyable and useful!"
18211,One of the best courses in Depression Modeling.
18212,"I like the course, very useful tutoring to start working with Galaxy, as a programme it gives me a lot of knowledge to help the big molecular scientists"
18213,It is a wonderful course. Professor Siedel has covered all the necessary areas and explained each topic with his mesmerizing teaching style.
18214,"Always wanted to be a software developer, this course is very information for the beginners. Any thanks to teachers of this course!"
18215,"It would a 4.5 star actually. The thing is the course thought me more in just a few hours than a 4 month physical course in Same Design. That it super awesome.There a few things here and there that i wish were more elaborated upon, but then again i only united the course not participated in it actively."
18216,"Great course! It was interesting, thorough, and information. Caught by a very talented, energetic professor."
18217,"The course gives a good overview on the algorithms types and problems, but it's cannot be used as standalone source of algorith,s learning. You should use good textbook as well.The programming challenges are really interesting (and challenging), sometimes it took for me a couple of evenings to complete all five week assignment.Thanks!"
18218,good but supporting material are poor
18219,"I liked the course. Is with the previous three courses, Or. Severance does a great job presenting the material and explaining how the code works. I felt that the assignment and the book were lacking a little bit:1. The textbook needs to be updated to include the Object Printed Programming section that is covered in Week 1.2. There is no programming exercise for the OOP section, just a quit.3. There are no assignment in the textbook for Chapters 14 and 15. The examples of the code and how it works is awesome, though, which is a trade off of sorts.4. The Chapter 14 programming assignment only require minimal programming in Python and/or SQL. I would have liked to do a little more programming.5. Chapter 15 felt like it was shoved in at the end, and the assignment was really easy. I was hoping for a little more rigor on that one, also.Overall, it was a good experience and I'm looking forward to finishing up this specialization when the Capstone is unlocked and becomes available."
18220,"Excellent course, very high quality present"
18221,I want more practice
18222,"Excellent course, with plenty of encouragement, community discussion, interaction, and of course learning! His course sets a high standard of how a Passive Open Online Course (MOOC) should be. Of you have any interest in coming mobile apes, CODAPPS is a great place to start. Going can be fun, and opportunity awaits! See for yourself. :-)"
18223,His is the second time I take this course. I have already got a certificate of this course in 2014. But still I love everything taught in this course! Andrew rules!
18224,"Fantastic Course; A bit heavy on the statistics, but very interesting to learn about a transition in food culture. Would be interesting to see a course about other places can apply the findings to change their own good culture."
18225,Awesome Course
18226,Very interesting
18227,Good into to the tools
18228,"Now! I really loved this part of the course. It has been a pleasure to take part in it. I have learned something new about Listening, Speaking, and Pronunciation that I have not thought about from this point of view. Thank you very much!"
18229,"I learned a lot from this course. I especially liked the guest speakers, they were some of the most respected and knowledgeable people in their field."
18230,A great introduction to the realm of machine learning. Would recommend it to anyone serious about of.
18231,"His course was an eye opened for learning what motivate and drives employees. Any of the technique taught in this course I have personally implements into my own work habits. Of you're new to management or seasoned, this course has value for everyone."

18233,very good course for begins
18234,wonderful and comprehensive introduction to infections !
18235,Great course!! To help me a lot in study!!! Especially chemistry and mathematics!
18236,Course gave great tools for understanding the mental processes involved in learning and how to use those tools for your own learning goals. Thank you very much for this learning experience!
18237,Outstanding ! I loved this course.
18238,"I think this is a very advisable course as a whole, The capstone offers a good occasion to put into practice what has been learned during the four previous courses and also works as a sort of review."
18239,"The course is essentially a self-help guide rousing on the idea that cooking real food promotes health. His is certainly a message that many people need to hear.Unfortunately, the advice concerning what to eat is less sound. Met me illustrate this with a historical counterexample.Round 75 years ago, a Canadian dentist visited my home country of Switzerland, where he examined the health and diet of a population in a secluded mountain valley. He found them to be of exceptional health. Their diet?breakfast: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheeselunch: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheesedinner: rye sourdough bread, butter, cheese and potatoes, along with some vegetables in the warmer half of the year, and small amounts of meat on SundaysContrary to four fundamental recommendations in the course, these people ate a lot of saturated fat (butter) and animal protein (cheese), but few vegetables and had hardly any variation in their diet.They did prepare their own food, grown or pastured locally, in very mineral-rich soil, which imparted their butter and cheese with very high amounts of fat-double vitamin A, D and Of. Perhaps animal foods are not as unhealthy as the course suggests, and food (and soil) quality is paramount.Instead of taking this course, watch May Dam's TEDx talk (http://www.couture.com/watch?v=5-gyIkA-cry) and brows the recommendations of the Lesion A. Price Foundation (http://www.westonaprice.org/) to learn what to cook, in particular their Healthy4Life dietary guideline (http://www.westonaprice.org/up-content/uplands/Healthy4LifeEnglish.of). Of you still need a self-help guide to actually start cooking your own food then by all means, take this course. It'll only take you about an hour."
18240,I found this course a really good introduction to the Project Management. I cannot wait for the next one.
18241,"I thought there will be more on interface and views.Not really ""West practices in interface design"" course.But it is good in More Data and UITableViews. North time.Change name! :-)"
18242,I thought this was a good course. I felt it met the objectives and kept my interest. It wasn't difficult at all and was very reasonable in terms of the time it took to take the course.
18243,"A very high level approach. These courses require a better path background and far more concrete explanation, since the student has a passive role and lecture mode is on."
18244,It was a very helpful and interesting course learned a lot from it.
18245,"His course sets the tone for knowing essentials of Oil and Was. Its biggest advantage is that it provides a structures knowledge so that we know what to know about the industry. I would strongly recommend to anyone who has interest in knowing essentials of oil and gas. Though, I would recommend that the course should have more input about markets like China and India and some policy coverage."
18246,"Wonderful Course , Amazing way to present it in very simple format , Not to learn true meaning of love, gratitude , micro-moments. It gave me new perspective about Positivity . Instead of ""being positive"" in every situation , which is not possible in many situations , ""Being Open"" in any situation really worked for me to be more Resilient while living my Imperfectly perfect life ."
18247,Great course!
18248,"Excellent course, well-explained and complete! It does need a lot of focus and practice to actually understand and master what's going on there."
18249,very good course
18250,Have been looking for something like this for twenty years - exploring Buddhist with a technical bent and relation to modern understanding of the mind. thank you. impressed with Robert Right.Would have liked to see a certificate and would have been a=happy to pay for this aspect if that was the barrier.

18261,Pretty good!
18262,"Like it all, except one moment -- ""rubles"" theme. But I think it's not about the coverage of a topic, but just me.Anyway, thank you!"
18263,"By this lesson, I can more learn about communication skill and method to manage many other project. I think this lesson is the best to make people's project management skill. Thank you for professor:"
18264,great course!His course help me a lot as practical approach to the pursuit of data science career.
18265,Excellent course material with a lot of emphasis on getting hands-on-experience.Any business and marketing have given their valuable insight that has made the course an excellent one.His course is really of!
18266,"By first course on Coursera and definitely worth it. The time load is 3-5 hours a week, which might be a scar number, but I'm glad I did it as I now have a nice overview of the things possible with of."
18267,Good variety and challenging but achievable. Thanks.
18268,liked this course so must ..full of great information ! ..it's really great course
18269,It is actually a fantastic course that great professors of University of London has created.Really grateful to them.I expect that they will develop more such courses about making root webster like that of Amazon etc.Thanks a lot!!!
18270,Or. Chuck is the best!
18271,Beer review is not best way to grade if requires some form of subjective judgement from people that maybe are not the very qualified to provide it.
18272,In excellent teacher and excellent content for people interested in programming (even if they don't have the basic knowledge of algorithm)
18273,Produced useful tools to deal with decision making
18274,His course has been very interesting for me.

18277,Pretty Effective Course!
18278,"Good explaining on data structures, however shallow for people who already have good programming skill."
18279,Moved this! Great for beginnner poets. The professor's energy really made this course for me.
18280,His was very help of everything i need to know about managing and dealing with different kinds of real world problems.
18281,Good course. I feel like Week 4 could have been explained slightly better but otherwise I really enjoyed it.
18282,"I enjoyed the simplicity but at the same time depthness of the course, it gave me useful and easy to apply tools in my practice."
18283,"After completing this course, I have to say I'm impressed. Normally I struggle to pay attention, but I found this subject absolutely captivating. Also, the teacher was very engaged in his lectures and did a wonderful job explaining all the concepts he talked about in the lectures."
18284,"Excellent course, with plenty of useful information and supplementary resources."
18285,"I really appreciate these series of courses, I want to thank Prof. Crosart and his coligues for their great job on preparing and presenting these series. Thanks a lot!"
18286,Thanks a million
18287,slightly repetition of classification course with no real use-case value except lots of path..
18288,"Very helpful, the teacher is super cool and he like Nape."
18289,"Suites are inconsistent with given dataset. Questions are bad: i.e. what is the difference between ""number of distinct countries mentioned"" and ""number of countries mentioned in sweets""."
18290,"Great Work by Coursera Team and University of Michigan , Looking forward to complete entire specialisation course..."
18291,His is all information I already have in my arsenal after searching health tends and learning more about how I should eat. I was hoping for something a little more detailed.
18292,Very good course
18293,good course
18294,Nicely designed course for students who don't have any prior knowledge in this particular sector. Really appreciate it.
18295,Great and helpful information for professional starting off in business writing.
18296,"The lectures are much better than Nodule 1 BUT still too thin on information required to complete the final assignment. I probably spent 30 hours in all completing the assignment because I had to spend so much time looking up material that was not covered in the lectures. A lot of my time got wasted since it is very difficult to figure out the santa/structure of the language from the very simply lectures &/or the very technical Apple documentation.Also, not ONCE did the instructor participate or respond to the forum discussion so it was not a surprise that the forum was barely used at all.I am stuck with smoldering on with the next 2 nodules since I pre-paid for the specialisation but really I am very disappointed with what I am getting for a paid course."
18297,Very Interesting subject. Nodules were very planned and slice.
18298,Excellent introduction to the ideas around what data science is and useful software.
18299,"Of you want to learn Python and are wondering where to begin, you are at the right place."
18300,Last module on Deep learning is not explained well as compared to other nodules.
18301,Thoroughly enjoyable and information course
18302,His course is excellent!
18303,A great introduction to Project Management. Clear and concise.
18304,"Often on Supra, I'm answering questions like http://www.quota.com/Which-programming-language-to-start-with-for-a-beginner/answer/On-Dark-1. I've upgrade my answer to point to this course. - as a good introductory course for Python beginners.I rate the course only 4/5, as I'd like to have (maybe optional) quires/assignment which are a bit more demanding, so that even a non-beginner would feel challenged."
18305,"Great explanation, challenging quires. May be very difficult for those who aren't used to grasping concept in baths."
18306,helpful
18307,I have learned so much from this course. Anyone that wants to write for young readers would do well to take this course. Thank you.
18308,Amazing teacher!
18309,His course gives us very fundamental idea of quantitative modeling but advanced modeling and/or tools. It's good for enter level students.
18310,Good start for the specialization
18311,"I enjoyed this course so much i wish it didn't have to end.The peer review experience in this course is completely fun and enriching.Even if you think you'd be terrible at writing poetry, just give it a go!"
18312,Fantastic course as always from the legendary Or Chuck
18313,Course is very good for beginners and for continuing to refresh the knowledge.
18314,Excellent! Nothing minus!
18315,"Awesome sir, awesome lectures and the best part awesome assignment..:)"
18316,"Highly recommend this course for all dental professional. Even though I am a dental hygienic, I have learnt so much by taking this course. 5/5"
18317,"awesome course and sir u are one of the best,but the problems/quit should be more rougher"
18318,"Good instruction, but it was a bit too basic - many of these concepts are common sense to most people in college or beyond."
18319,Extremely useful for families~
18320,I really enjoyed the passe and the visual stimulation. I appreciate that Or. May Dam made the lecture personal by sharing her experiences and including her family in the video. Thank you and I look forward to completing more courses especially if Or. Dam is the presented.
18321,"Very exciting and interesting course. Both the do of Or Robinson and Prof Ferri made it possible to understand the fundamentals of Electronics. Is a graduate of ECE, this was a perfect refreshed for me."
18322,His is probably one of the worst courses I've taken in Coursera.Must an enumeration of what's on each version of the operative systems and few more information.
18323,amazing classes and you can find more information around the web to help your site to be well done
18324,"ÓTIMO CURSO, IREI REALIZAR TODOS!"
18325,"Great course to start with, lot of resources to help you, playground tool is awesome!"
18326,Excellent material and explained well by the professor!
18327,I learned some interesting Tools about Learning. I would love the course to engage us with more concrete Learning
18328,cool class about machine learning
18329,Good Course. A bit short but goes straight to the point.
18330,Great Course :D
18331,"The best course out there, not just in of, but in all of online teaching. Beautifully designed course content, expert designed assignment that are tough and though provoking, and lot of help through forum. You cannot go wrong by choosing this course"
18332,"Barbara is an incredible teacher. His course has given me the tools to be able to continue my studies with strength and confidence and without feeling lost. Now I have a guide to follow :) Thanks, thanks and thanks."
18333,"His course was a very exciting experience for me. Professor Robert is in love with what he is doing. That shows in every step of the course - the structure, rheumatic & length of lectures,& the guest speakers interesting & useful web sites. And that prof. has not only very deep knowledge & passion for the subject, but also very broad practical experience, which he generously shares with the students makes the course even more valuable. I am MBA student and Financial Market is the key subject of my program, I find that taking this course was a useful & inspiring journey. Because of not having became with my lawton I was not able to verify all the Ruin but It was really a great learning and gaining knowledge. Thank you Professor Robert Miller."
18334,"I really enjoy the course, now I know the tactics I need to influence others and how can I protect myself from other people using those tactics on me. Thank you!"
18335,Great course for people who are struggling to connect to this world.
18336,"Lots of great condensed content. I miss a written summary of the video though. Furthermore, the quality of sound is awful. Well designed quires and assignment. Good: In-video quires."
18337,His was a very good experience for me. The material was easily digestive but at the same time with at lot of depth. I love how the professor invites you to dig into the more academic material without it being a prerequisite
18338,"The course, as intended probably, is theoretical and gives a good snapshot of project management. Following the PMBOK guide and covering all the relevant portions in the limited time deserves an applause. The only area of improvement, I felt, was the case study.It could have been a little more detailed and has scope of increased level of difficulty. A good course overall and beneficial in almost all walks of work :) Thank you !"
18339,Nothing can beat this ...!
18340,Great course! Prof. Fanny Chamovitz is a very good teacher and I feel that now I know much more about plant and life in general. Thank you for the course.
18341,Fascinating course about how the internet developed and how security works. Seeing interviews with some of the prime moves and developer in this field was particularly rewarding. The encryption exercises were great fun too.
18342,Very good introduction to Of game development in Unity game engine. Projects are also interesting and leave ample room to showcase our own creativity.
18343,Extremely useful and well organised course for beginners on project management.
18344,"His was a great course, lots of information on analyzing problems at work and coming up with the best solution"
18345,great clearly explained ...
18346,Great instructor!
18347,"Very interesting, useful and also enjoyable. I have also liked the professors' style very much, clear and pleasant."
18348,Life changing. I always thought I had a learning disability. With this course it taught me who I am and how I learn. Taking advantage of how I learn to enhance my life.
18349,when you finish the course you won't be able to print out your certificate so don't even waste your time with this is webster. I am beyond passed in and I'm reporting this to everyone this a real comment about this course too.
18350,"Content is good, with clear explanation.The programming assignment could be improved by adding more challenging questions."
18351,"Is good as Course 1, grate learning experience"
18352,Great course on teaching!
18353,important and very interesting.
18354,Very nice explanations!
18355,"I found plenty of useful information in this course overall but lectures often spent too much time dwelling on the detail of simpler concepts while more complex areas, and sometimes critical information that was later built upon, were only touched briefly or sometimes skipped entirely. I missed a sense of continuity as we skipped from model to model with a minimum of time spent on how the models complement each other and their relative strength and weaknesses in application.The way data structures were defined in the code was particularly difficult to deal with. The coming exercises all suffered as a result. It ended up taking way too much time to figure how to decide the data and trace logic around it. His meant that grasping concepts and learning from the questions came in a distant second priority to debugging.Or Toller mentioned that the material is aimed at postgraduates. I felt that the level of content covered here would just as easily be grasped by most undergraduate in technical discipline if it had been delivered in a more structures manner with clearer progression across models (conceptual and mathematically) and better code examples. When delivering in this format, allowances need to be made for the facts that tutoring sessions do not exist and the possibilities for informal Q&A are limited so any gaps become very difficult for students to fill in themselves.Despite the above shortcomings I'm glad I did the course and I would still recommend it to someone interested in graphics models as it does cover the basis well enough to make a decent start. I'm not sure whether or not I'd recommend the programming exercises as they are a significant time sink but at the same time, without spending time attacking the programming problems the concepts are not likely to get based on the video and quires alone."
18356,"His is a wonderful course that strengthens the ability to learn and remember information, and also encourages the participant by teaching that you are capable of more than you thought."
18357,great course indeed!
18358,His course was of great importance to me. It helped me to start learning without struggling as much as before. Technique that are shown in course are really useful and helpful. I would recommend this course to everyone.
18359,"His course is helpful and I have learned quite a bit about punctuation and sentence structures.However, while things like tense are important, to be able to differentiate 12 tense contributes relatively little to typical academic writing. Father, I have had trouble with seemingly simple questions such as when to use past tense and when to use present tense in a literature review. But these aspects are probably the most useful when it comes to practical writing. It would be helpful if these issues are addressed.Also, the use of articles is a common weakness for a lot of students (to ""the"" or not to ""the""). It is helpful to include this component too."
18360,100% of satisfaction.
18361,Excellent professors and materials!
18362,Was been fantastic so far - hoping to purchase and complete it
18363,In awesome and must take course for the burdino.
18364,"For being a free course, it was pretty good."
18365,Most advanced course for essay writing. One of the MOOc has prepared such quantitative course till date.
18366,"The course gave a well structures overview on sound synthesis and I found it a good idea to combine it with building a song-project. It is really an overview - and this could be better labelled in the course description (there are a lot of other synthesis types like am, wavetable etc.) - however looks like trying it out is the best way to get into it. To this is a starting point into the wonderful and complex world of sound synthesis."
18367,Very good course showing how to interact with the internet. Assignment could have been a little more taxing but on the whole it gives a flavour of what is possible.
18368,"One of the best courses i ever had. Amazing lessons with real time examples to understand and analyze the business situations, risks, competence and many more. Wonderful Course and Wonderful Professor. Learnt a lot in this course. Thank you so much !!"
18369,"In order your programs do what you need, you have to learn how to organize the data in the best possible way.His course gives you the necessary tools so you learn what is the best way to use data in your programs.Easy to learn and best easy to apply"
18370,"The capstone was well constructed and the choice of Cela as a case study was on point.However, it would be nice to have the option of preparing a marketing mix plan for our own business - as an option to replace the capstone. That being said, this is an excellent specialization and I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to learn how to apply marketing mix principles to real business situations. Excellent course!!!"
18371,good course
18372,"His was an excellent introduction to HTML5, and I liked the emphasis on inaccessibility."
18373,"His course on the Fundamentals of Everyday Leadership was really useful. I did not know what to expect at first but the logic in the video, the brightness of the case activities and the richness of the papers to read before helped me to build the foundations of my leadership skill. I am really eager to do the other courses and gain more knowledge and skill.A special thanks to the Professor for his personal stories that add a lot to the concepts !"
18374,"the course was fantastic especially the 1 minute lawyer segments. Not sure if it is a site problem, problem with the course or with my machine but I frequently had times where the picture would freeze and audit would continue. The video while information were also quite long and it might have been a better idea to divide each 20 minute video into 2 smaller ones. Otherwise though it was a great course by a fantastic professor."
18375,His is very nice course. At's off to the professor.
18376,Excellent course! interesting topic!
18377,Great course for an introduction on competitive strategy. Easy to understand and follow and the quires keep you on track. Recommended!
18378,"I recommend this course to all my colleagues. Its enriched content certainly helped me to understand things in better way and provided content in structures way, which is I liked most."
18379,interesting course that helps you to improve your English writing. Very good
18380,Great course!
18381,His is very useful course
18382,Great course
18383,Interesting insight in the history of photography and current way of how photo are seen.
18384,It is a good introductory course in Data Science
18385,"very useful course, not only for Luxury industry. Any topics talked about are enlighten. After learning, I think I am more reasonable facing all fancy things and choose them more sophisticated."
18386,it's a great course offering a great quality of work covering everything i needed to know about meetings and how to handle meetings in a great professional way.
18387,very hard but excellent course
18388,"very good for beginners , who dont have idea about programming , and good start for every one new in patron"
18389,His course is really fun to take!!!
18390,"It is an excellent course. The graphics, explanation, and examples are quite exceptional. Congrats"
18391,Excellent course! Maiden University's courses are great as always!
18392,It is an excellent course .. it put me on track of learning of .. It is not so advanced so one can easily follow G and it is not so trivial. G is doing great job by simplifying the ideas and algorithms .. I recommend this course for beginners
18393,want to learn it again
18394,It has been extremely useful and insightful.
18395,Very light workload if you're technically competent. I would have liked to have had more to do with the path and such...
18396,"It's a must-take course for all people interested in mastering Machine Learning. I'm so glad I went through all the video, review sessions and assignment!"
18397,"I think the Course has great content but there´s too many activities per week, most of the time if you don´t have time free you will loss the deadline and after all loss the certificate."
18398,His is a very good course with lot of fundamentals as well as practical examples and suggestions. Prof G is surely an expert in this field and it was a real pleasure attending his classes.
18399,very nice course
18400,"I really appreciate the process we were walked through, it's awesome to really get an understanding of Flogging West Practices through this MOOC. I wish we could have covered additional style and turned in more large assignment. I suppose that's what the Capstone is for!"
18401,"Very useful and didatic, even for a non English speaker, congratulations teacher!"
18402,"I just want to say thank you so much to Or.Have Dixon, Or.Austin Shewell and Jessica Into for the wonderful job :) Love all of you ."
18403,I hope this can be on demand course
18404,"excellent , actually and well driven by Or Bandy Lava"
18405,I like this course! All information is important and really necessary in the work! Thank you Prof. Siedel for this work!
18406,Great learning experience. Learnt lot of concepts and pricking models. Thank you Faculty for efforts in explaining various aspects of financial
18407,"I enjoyed this course a lot! It gives a good introduction to the topic of real time systems, the lessons are well organized and you don't need to be a computer science expert to learn and understand the material taught in the course. The course not only reaches theory but gives you practical guideline and very useful examples/assignment to illustrate how the theory is used in practice to solve typical problems and design real time systems , which is the feature I liked most about this course. His ""hands-on"" approach is very useful to the practitioner, with some expensive and simple hardware at your disposal the open-source software tools introduced in the course can get you quite far in designing your own real time system! Heedless to say, no course is perfect and there are always things that can be improved. For example, the wording of the assignment and quires in this course is in dire need of an update/edit."
18408,top notch course
18409,"Not useful, learned very little from it."
18410,In enlightening and valid course for learning in sustainable development. I strongly recommend the course.
18411,"A great course, its very interesting!! Describe!!"
18412,His course is both intensive and challenging. Or. Innate does a fantastic job with real life examples and explaining subtle points that will help get ahead in the weekly quit.
18413,Not to learn about various tools and their uses.To it was a very information course to start with data analysis
18414,"I admitted in this Course , and I completed it. I would like to say that this course is the great course to improve our English skill. Even more, this course is the best way to start studying business for whom interested on business."
18415,Amazing course! The teacher keeps it super interesting from start to end! Its definitely useful if you want to get into laws and policies and you have no background knowledge about it!
18416,His course and material does not articulate the 'Google Loud Platform' offerings. Maybe Google does not want to compete with Microsoft Azure and AWS alike. Of Google itself has approved this 'Google Loud Platform' training on Coursera then vol I am out. I am way better off supporting AWS and Azure (at least they have tons of good training and stuff to keep folks in the field excited).
18417,"Really useful! Well-explained and well-organized, unfordable price. It helped me a lot for my job! Really worth it, I suggest it to every beginner who wants to know the bases and also some advanced features of html, iss and javascript.."
18418,It is worth to do it
18419,I learned quite a lot during this which I can use in practice. Everything is well explained in the video's. Of I had to call a down side then I would say that I had a hard time with the path. His is because I never did something marines and linear algebra. For those people who miss this background into I would like to say: if you're dedicated then you should be able to survive this course!
18420,"His course was the most efficient and complete I've ever watched. I'm so grateful that I have an opportunity to enhance my learning skill. These materials can be called 'gold' without any doubts. I will try to put in practice everything I've got in this course. Also, I want to say a tremendous Thank You to the creator and participants of this course! His work was worth doing."
18421,"well, it's the previous part of the Python for everyone. Why did Coursera split it to another course?"
18422,Love this course.
18423,One of the finest courses dealing with heritage and its conservation.
18424,Deep views. The why part o things is something very special.
18425,this is for your kind information that due to some technical problem i am suffering too much. kindly consider and give me certificates . Thanking you. NABAKISHORE PANDU
18426,"wonderful, clear, passionate"
18427,I liked a lot of this course until now.
18428,"I found the course to have some really helpful approaches to solving algorithmic problems when test input are unknown. Great ""Toolbox"" for a programme."
18429,"Excellent job on content selection, visual materials, reacting clips, guest lectures and presentation! Truly appreciated Or. More's engaging and pleasant securing style - his passion for the subject is truly contagious and inspiring. Thank you for putting together such an information course that gave a good picture of evolution and devise of the Woman Empire, but did not overwhelm with too many dates or characters - not an easy thing to do given the complexity of the history and the time span covered."
18430,Amazing! He all need this knowledge in our day by day.
18431,Insight after insight ... great course
18432,Absolutely Named. Programming for every body. His course will remove any kind of fear about programming and makes learning fun. cheers to Or Chuck. :)
18433,"concise and integrated organization, complex concepts wrapped up in short direct sentences, no reasoning is needed for the students because everything makes sense directly. Startling slide show in the background very content rich and a lot of work to put it together, he can make a 15 min material easily digested in 5 min for the students."
18434,"Highly theoretical presentation on attributes of TCP vs UDP packets, and also about IPv4 vs IPv6 packets,A little more on advantages/disadvantages of one over the other, some background history on why and how it was developed, response from device manufacturers, and some opinions on future adoption would be great value-added to the course.Thanks, Professor Hung."
18435,Vice course on Bootstrap. From an entry level to a fairly advanced in just four pretty intensive weeks.
18436,"Is a systems programme, this course was a great into to the world of web design. The introduction of HTML, CSS, and of was absolutely perfect. The site definitely gets more difficult in the latter weeks, but with a bit of extra time everything I needed to succeed was there in the lectures. Great course!"
18437,Very good overview and straightforward explanations of the different methodologies of of. Vice tips on how to do of with R.
18438,"To far so good, It was a bit difficult to get going but I'm excited to continue with the specialization."
18439,"Great course, good overview over the most interesting topics of machine learning with the possibility to try them out with your own code.Easy to use submission system (both Active and MATLAB worked fine).Minor drawback: an overview of more advanced/complex implementation of the concepts shown would be helpful for deciding where to go next after this course. Still, 5 Stars, because the course covers the important algorithms well enough to understand and use them, within very short video."
18440,Clear presentation. Interesting examples. Encouraging knowledge. Helpful professor.
18441,"I absolutely recommend. I graduated from business school, passed all three levels of CFA but I gained tremendous from this course. Made me realize I didn't know fund"
18442,"His has been a fun course. The length of it is ideal. It's long enough to think I've learned something, but short enough that I'm not bored or dreading it. I definitely spent at least 10-15 hours a week on it. I had to read most of the relevant text book sections (the free, online one) to do the homework. Results may vary. I'm not sure how intense this is compared to an actual college course. By guess would be about half as intense, but it would definitely prepare you to breeze right through such a course. I took it out of genuine interest and I might use it in my current career."
18443,"please be nice to Chinese mainland students, the net problem, just like we can't use goose in China, but we need to unload some assignment on it."
18444,Excellent. Thank you for an interesting and well presented course.
18445,"All the content provided is very good and the tests are of a good level too.Was just sad that the course on of system didn't say a word about the extra organ represented by our microbiome, that nothing was said about the immune system, hematopoiesis, developmental physiology and genetic, the detailed functions of the liver (nothing on the production of urea and the veto mechanism), and some behavior aspects could be interesting."
18446,His course was improve wonderfully my project management skill.
18447,"I had very high hopes for this course. I was actually planning to purchase the specialization - just as a thank you gesture. Unfortunately, there is very little to be grateful for here.In this course, you get a series of super short lectures giving you an overview of the path and physics behind the aerial robotics. I can't be the judge (since I hold a degree in this area), but I don't think you'll be able to get much if you aren't familiar with the topics yet. And you most certainly won't learn anything new if you had some previous training.And then suddenly there are assignment. That have almost nothing to do with the lectures, but require quite a bit of Atlas programming (did I mention you won't be taught any Atlas in the process?) To make things worse, the assignment are rather poorly explained.By the way, you won't get any replies from the course team - they even ignore questions about errors in lectures.The course looks very floppy. Is if someone forced the team to put together something for Coursera. A huge disappointment :("
18448,"I loved this course and all the interesting speakers. I learned a great deal and how much I am prepared for a disaster, I had no idea. Well worth every minute."
18449,"Great course for data preparation for of which is sometimes neglected in other courses. Great instructor. Useful assignment. Assignment require research on your own which is good. I would recommend to maybe make the course longer and cover more topics (in-depth string processing etc.), because it felt a bit short. Thanks Or. Brooks for putting this together."
18450,Probably the fist course that one should take when starting his/her learning career with Coursera.
18451,Good course content but it can be very difficult to get help if you are stuck on something.
18452,Highly recommended! Pollen van Went is the coolest instructor!
18453,good course
18454,"The effect of this course on He is amazing , worth going for interesting and great !"
18455,"Great Course , Great Teachers.Its like McDonalds and I'm loving it!"
18456,Great course. Excellent instructor.
18457,Not worth wasting your time over: they state that which is blatantly obvious and provide little insight into human factors of security.
18458,"The concepts are excellent, but I was a little taken back that the content examples, required reading and/or case studies were dated. Perhaps the best research and case studies are 4-5 years old. I thoroughly enjoyed reading them and learning from them. I guess the reason I didn't give the course 5 stars is because I expect at least one reading or case study pre module (ideally) to be published within the last 12 months. Overall it was really fun and information and I will be taking more classes. All the best...Stephanie Schreurs"
18459,"While the subject is interesting, the professor sometimes makes it confusing and dense to understand the basic ideas.Maybe this course does need a mathematics or economic background..."
18460,"Very well structures, content well explained and extremely relevant for someone starting Project Management."
18461,"Outstanding perspective, excellent insight and an awesome professor."
18462,It very basic but still very useful
18463,Course material is very good for people like me who are completely new to R.
18464,"While the overview of the content seemed very reasonable both in scope and pacing, the lack of will exercises meant that the final project for the course was a bit jostling. Overall, I think this course still needs some development in the way of exercises to familiarity the student with the practical exercises associated with machine learning."
18465,very good！I love this so much！
18466,"It was a great pleasure to follow this course who helped me in acquiring a thorough understanding, and awareness, on the benefits of positive psychology. I will miss my weekly appointment with Oct. Fredrickson!"
18467,I have learned a lot from this course. Highly recommended for any one works in the commercial department of any fashion and luxury company.
18468,"Great course about principles of economics. Nowadays, the most of economists forget thus history of economy."
18469,"Outstanding introduction to Python programming language that will lay strong foundation to the more advanced topics about Python. The teaching style is superb and the things you learn stick in the long term memory really quickly. You need, however, to put additional effort on your side in order to truly ""get"" what's going on and learn and program as much as you can, as doing is really learning. Excellent, excellent course, teacher and the community."
18470,Course is enjoyable and interesting so far.
18471,Good platform to start about analysis
18472,"The speaker isn't very good, he speaks looking at his monitor all the time while he is reading the sides. I am not very happy about this course, I think it could be better if subjects would be deeper."
18473,A good course but needs to be updated and also new material has to be added.
18474,I found this course extremely interesting and very information. I have long been interested in the evolution of society and in particular the advances made by society. The development of the nation state and its institutions was fascinating.
18475,Excellent content and overview of the field. Appreciated the links to journal papers as extensions to the lecture notes. Course is let down somewhat by lecture notes that skin the surface too much to really be useful and outright errors in quires and assignment that will hinder completion unless you read through every forum post to find the missing information. (Ruin 13 was the worst offender).
18476,Great course for begginers! Thank you!
18477,Excellent classes! I really recommend it!
18478,"Great course with a lot of hands on and practical information. I would not mind going into bigger detail. It will be a big effort to implement it in the company, but it will be worth it. Thanks for the course!"
18479,"Course objectives are clear and concise. Course instructor's voice is beat and she articulated well. Visual are simple and focus on key concepts. Course contents follows a logical progressive flow from easy to more complex concepts. Small chinks of information makes it easy to follow. His is an excellent course and definitely worth while the investment. For me, It has spared a keen interest in the field of SEO and it has build my confidence to proceed to the next level."
18480,I really enjoyed this course it was very information.
18481,"It was my first course here in Coursera and I'm really grateful for all the knowledge that you have given me. I am eager to learn more, thanks for this opportunity."
18482,Very good course.
18483,"Now, really nice course! Well done! Or Matthew can explain everything clearly, you can lean a lot from him!"
18484,very helpful to fresh leader on machine learning .
18485,Good. Waiting for session to began.
18486,His is a great introduction to d printing and the maker movement. Things I thought I knew were corrected and resources I never knew about were introduced. Very worthwhile
18487,Very interesting course.
18488,Great course. I learned a lot; thank you so much for all this time!
18489,I really appreciate the work that is done by Andrew G. He is a talent and a great teacher. I definitely recommend to take this course if you want to start learning of.
18490,"In amazing course that reaches you to practice self-knowledge, understanding your bad habits, accepting procrastinator and how to stop it, so you can improve your learning skill. I highly recommend this to anyone that want's to learn better, stay motivate not only on college classes but also at work."
18491,It's an amazing course. Thank you Professor Yakov! I'm going to continue learning your angular course
18492,"His course was wonderful. I learned new things about grammar and punctuation I don't recall learning in grade school while blending and improving my known knowledge. A tip for those thinking of just unrolling in one or two random courses of the five specialized courses, knoll in all. It is worth it even if you think you know. For instance, some of the papers in Advance Writing expect you to know some of the previous courses into and that could lead to some misunderstandings or struggles on quit/peer reviews."
18493,"A excellent overview of Internet History, the underlying technology and a quick tour of SSL/TLS. The interviews with some key folks of internet folklore was an added advantage. Highly recommended."
18494,Well thought out. Learnt some new approaches to common tasks.
18495,brilliantly designed courses...
18496,Great Course...especially for someone who doesn't have a CSE background but is immensely interested in learning it
18497,Pretty good beginner's course
18498,"The course is excellent. Only problem is, for me, it is very hard to understand the meaning of the final assignment. The description is too simple."
18499,"Very engaging professor, easily understood. The obvious editing was very distracting and made one wonder what was being delete."
18500,"His course worth devoting a lot of private time. I got overall knowledge of Machine Learning. I'm a mechanical engineer and I'm not sure this course help my career. However, I believe that someday this knowledge will help me go through better career."
18501,Great course. Love how it's broken down and the explanation of course work and subject are easy to follow.
18502,Learned a lot.The notions of testing and debugging really inspired me.
18503,Good introduction! I wish it was deeper though
18504,Vice introduction learned a lot thanks madam for your valuable lectures.
18505,Relent overview of all knowledge needed to become a better photographer
18506,nice one to get into the strategy of any kind of the competionsyou could pass it even if you didn't go through the Part1anyhow it will be more then useful to understand the basis
18507,"It´s easy to follow up, well structures."
18508,"Great work with building up the course, especially starting with the core concepts and then progressing gradually into practical implementation.I especially liked the introduction to handlebars. I was not expecting it in this course."
18509,Was very interesting and useful. Would recommend to my friends ad colleagues. Session of Or. Chuck was really Interesting. Thanks a lot Or. Chuck for my first course on Coursera. Looking forward to the next course.
18510,His is an excellent course with questionnaire support and exercises
18511,Absolutely new to Python and this course made it all simple. Great contents and great delivery by the Professor.
18512,The only thing is I would have liked to have the chance to give more detailed peer reviews.
18513,I like the way it's presented.
18514,"Very interesting, information & important course for the teachers.The course became very exciting, interesting & information mainly due to Or. Have Vision!Thank you very much!"
18515,"Well-structures lessons, comprehensive covers planning & initiation stages of project management. The quires felt a little easy at times!"
18516,"Simple to follow overview of useful concepts, helpful reference documents for further reading."
18517,Great course! Would be improved with more practical exercises.
18518,Really awesome course. I like that it has all the theory and a lot of hands-on projects to practice and learn the how-to of design. I totally recommend it.
18519,"I strongly recommend this course to everyone: Caught by a great instructor, this is a well developed course that encourages you to conduct an actual negotiation with another person (for me that was someone across the globe I found through course forum) and put the learning into practice and receive valuable insight about my personal negotiating style and how I could improve it. I also purchased the text book written by the instructor. However, I am disappointed it doesn't extend much beyond what is already in the video. To be honest, I felt the book was necessary as there were a lot of margin and not-so-clear rules I had to master; especially as a physician, I found contractual law to be challenging. The final exam was tough, but not unconquerable.Thank you Or.Siedel!"
18520,great introductory level course on using patron to study stock.
18521,It was an enjoyable and quite complete course. I really learned a lot from this. Thank you so much!!!!
18522,"Thanks a lot! I do learn a lot from this course, and I'm sure will take more lessons like this."
18523,It's an excellent course where you can remember and learn concepts about the behaviour of materials under certain forces.
18524,"Very easy to understand, in just some hours I felt familiar with the basis of the code"
18525,"Awesome material. The Concepts are well explained. Only downside in my opinion are the lectures sides, which could have a cleaner look."
18526,"I liked the initial approach of this course, swell as the resources given. However, I feel that the difficulty the exercises showed wasn't really linked to the concepts: many things were not explained in the lectures, and I had to find the complementary information in various sites. To, rather than evaluation the understanding of the concepts given in the lectures, the skill to look for further information was possessed."
18527,"The new platform is very versatile and easy to navigable. The page layout is much more clear. It is easy to navigable from course material to discussion boards.I like the Ruin format, including expanding the number of choice for the multiple choice selections, but the trading was confusing. For Ruin 3, some questions came back with multiple ""Well One"" comments, even when I had not selected the answer for which I was being praised. I also was told I made errors on the same question.... and this was after I answered the question (Question 2, on R genetic functions) the exact same as I had answered it when I took the course earlier this year.I was not a fan of not having to take a picture to submit work, so I am pleased that is no longer a requirement. I hope the tying pattern match is sufficient to affirm identity.I have one comment on content specific to this class. Week 3 content lacks relevance to the project and data products in general. I agree that knowledge of R packages, classes, and methods is an important part of understanding R. I am not sure where that fits in the Data Science curriculum as a whole, though. Maybe expanding the curriculum to include a second, more advanced R class, with a project to write our own methods, build an R package, or do something with that. That would assign relevant work to reinforce the lectures.I would be happy to do further beta testing.DCP"
18528,Very good course. You can get a common sense how to make
18529,"Definitely my favourite course so far from whole of specialisation! For such a short time course is packed with everything you need and hints where to search for more knowledge. Oh, and instructor is such a nice and bubble person which makes the whole experience even more positive, I wish I had this kind of teachers at my un back in the day!"
18530,Excellent course.The final exam was awesome.Very demanding and exciting course
18531,Assignment needs slight abolishing. Otherwise course delivers what it promises.
18532,Very out of date.
18533,Great！
18534,I have been trying to get a job at largest hospital here in of. I went through an interview process and I let the parties involved know that I was taking a course on medical terminology from PITT. I believe this was a plus and I would like to thank you for such a wonderful course. It was very challenging since I am not familiarized with the healthcare vocabulary but you guns made it easy with the many resources that were provided. I had fun and spent lots of time searching the internet as well.The good news is I got the job and I finished the course just in time because I will be starting my new job soon. Thank you Mrs. Swigart and Or. Old.
18535,Vice course on reproducible research!
18536,Great lecture and great course.
18537,Very well done. I would have liked it if there were more assignment.
18538,Very good but should be longer
18539,"Great class, very applicable. I am glad I come across this class."
18540,highly recommended
18541,Thank You! Andrew G!
18542,A good introduction to functional programming in general.
18543,By first step in my new world...I love it!
18544,"Interesting into to JSON, REST, SOA with Python."
18545,"Great, great class! I've already recommended this course to all of my colleagues and I will finish the entire series of classes."
18546,His is a great course that covers a lot of fascinating topics. Professor Empty does a great job presenting the material. Thanks a lot for the interesting course.
18547,It is an interesting and easy to understand overview of the topic. I recommend it for derbies to the topic and those who just want to refresh basic knowledge they might have gathered in other courses.
18548,"I'm grateful to the professor for constructing and delivering this course. I learned a few things but the lack of musical analysis was a disappointment. I know that form is important but there was no mention of population, chord progression or decadence style (John versus Paul). I feel the course should have been title The History of the Measles."
18549,"Awesome and excellent course for students, professional and everyone interested in Planning & Design of Sanitation Systems and Technologies for low income countries like my country Siberia."
18550,very clear and interesting for anyone who want to improve your language skill :)
18551,Very interesting and existing work please keep going.
18552,"Very well-organized, very clear and straight to the point. All the materials and exercises are really useful."
18553,His course comes in handy for anyone without finance background and attract to learn it
18554,"Straightforward, quality content."
18555,Good overview course.
18556,I loved this course and I believe I gained some valuable skill and knowledge by taking the course.
18557,"its very good course and I seriously inspired the way it reaches me, first time I opened R programming and now I am little more comfortable, hope and wish I will continue my zeal toward data science, thanks for the course"
18558,"The course is great for beginners and the professor takes through most of the important aspects of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Assignment are very helpful."
18559,"I like the way the instructor explained each part of the Grammar and Punctuation, I understood easily and practiced after session. His course is very helpful to me. Thank you for offering this course."
18560,Its an excellent course and thanks to Professor for making this course so practice tormented.
18561,"Great guideline and teaching schematics, I love the way the lectures are approach and how this vast topic has been made basic, easy and understandable."
18562,Love it.
18563,"The video were not always easy to understand because of the unclear pronouncing of the key speaker. Also although most of the tests were easy to complete, the ones that you had to write the answer down instead of only choosing the correct answer, were hard since if one word you wrote was wrong you lost the question."
18564,Great overview and practical insight from the industry. Very beneficial as a good introduction.
18565,Straightforward and the homework submission process is great... very simple and streamlined :) The only recommendation for improvement is that some of the video dwell for quite a while on very simple operations but skin over some of the more interesting or complex operations. it would be nice to see more time on proofs and less on super simple things.
18566,"Excellent! The best programming I've ever seen, down to core basic, easy to understand and follow."
18567,"I enjoyed this course and learning, specifically how to adapt a wealthier diet and the evolution of food in the of. The video were interesting and the information was insightful and applicable to daily life. The only thing I might change in the course is having the professor incorporate definitions to some of the terms (i.e. nutrient dense, , metallic abnormalities) in the video, or as a supplemented document.I would recommend this course to others."
18568,too many trading errors.
18569,His was great!!I wish there was a training exercise for weeks 10-11.Thanks a lot :)
18570,"Amazing course, definitely learned a lot regarding systematic reviews. The only thing I found to be a bit challenging is that at some lectures they assume you have previous knowledge in states, while for someone like me this is my first states course. But don't worry, it doesn't interfere a lot without your overall understanding of systematic reviews.Note: it focused a lot more on systematic review that it does on met-analysis, which kind of makes sense because met-analysis is only an optional component of a systematic review, as you'll get to know in this course."
18571,Thorough and the course lectures really transmit their interest and passion for the subject which is important in any course. Thoroughly recommend it if you are interested in planning around a subject and seeing the bigger picture.
18572,"Great introduction information for newcomers , Thank you"
18573,Very interesting through creative assignment you can learn and refine things about image telling.
18574,Awesome course by ProfJeanne M. LiedtkaonDesign Thinking !!!
18575,"St the West Teacher and an incredible course, cheers chuck! :)"
18576,"Lots of good material, though I don't like how they've repacked the original material from the prior longer version, which I worked through at my own pace a year ago, off session. Framing all the material relating to NoSQL and Graph Analytics into the final week without assignment is ineffective. Instead, consider rousing the th week on NoSQL, and keep an assignment with it, maybe even the original Fig assignment that required and AWS account. I don't think the nominal charge Amazon will levy would hold anybody up who's serious about learning to process data at scale, it's just a few bucks."
18577,"To the course is a mixed bag.PROS: The lecture content is useful, albeit a bit dry. I can't give them too much slack for the dryness, after all it's coming. However, they could have shown more real-time coming, rather than just strolled through powerpoints with the Command Window passed. You definitely need to have R open when following along with the lectures. The quires are also quite useful, as you're required to know both the background of how things work and use the commands learned from the lecture.CONS: The assignment assume you know a lot more than the basic knowledge, and there's no real way to know how to do the assignment just from the lectures. The quires tend to be on the easy side and the assignment camp things up quite quickly. There's no intermediate material to test your skill. You have to have worked in R to have even a minor chance at succeeding on the assignment."
18578,Excellent course content and delivery. It has kick started me to move on my own pace and dive down into data sciences.
18579,Awesome class!!More courses please.Maybe some courses to rep for topic proficient as well.
18580,Breaks page in end.. Some of Bootstrap components were only described do this and this instead WHAT are the parts and option and WHY do we do this and that.
18581,"Such a nice course offered by the Coursera! Our course instructor professor Brain Inn design the whole course syllabus such a way that anyone from the beginner level can easily understood the basic things of Same Development.I just love and enjoyed the whole course, and very much interested to finish the whole specialization courses."
18582,"It is very easy and clear, good for all the first year international students who did not perform well in TOEFL or GRE. Maybe a little bit too easy and too slow for advanced learner."
18583,Very light overview.
18584,Very insightful and important topic! I am thrilled that this is available. His should be a requirement for everyone who works in any setting with and
18585,"Excellent course, taught by absolutely amazing and intellectual stimulating professors."
18586,"I found the programme very information and engaging. I learnt concepts in neurobiology and post the programme, I am able to see neurobiology play out all around us in our everyday life. Or. Mason's teaching style is informal and engaging."
18587,A really good and information beginner course.
18588,Great course into the physiological aspects of addition and brain psychology. Please have expand the course.
18589,"Great course, i learned a lot from it. I look forward to another course like this :thanks!"
18590,"His course helped me a lot! Very useful and meaningful! Very week assignment made me a little bit busy and crazy, but those were also meaningful works for me!"
18591,Excellent course. Highly recommended.The mathematical nations are sometimes confusing.
18592,"Excellent Idea and concept, thank you!"
18593,"Starts off really basic, but is thorough. Overall, very information."
18594,Great course
18595,"It introduces very practical methods helping me get out of learning troubles, thanks very much!~"
18596,The teaching is very clear. It will be better if there are more tests. Exercises are important in coming.
18597,Lecture sides were well explained and assignment were not too difficult so getting demoralized was out of the question. Thanks for everything.
18598,"There was some really great information presented, but mixed in with tangential and unimportant sources (I don't care about the fashionable aspects of of!!)"
18599,"Excellent, as all the other courses!"
18600,To cool and much practical.
18601,I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Machine Learning.
18602,The projects are to die for.
18603,"Comprehensive, pitched at just the right level. Perfect length of course. In eye opened - highly recommend."
18604,Amazing course!
18605,Good Course
18606,You cannot get easy answers for homework and it pushes you to think hard.
18607,It is the best place to learn.
18608,It really helped me a lot in my studies. thank you coaches!
18609,more than great!!!
18610,Basis are well covered. I would recommend this course to everyone.
18611,"Beer Review system needs an overhauled. I would suggest increasing the number of reviews required by each student so you one incorrect (based on user error) review does not influence your grade so significantly.Otherwise, this is an information and useful course."
18612,"A bit odd this one. It have some points, but most of the training is looking on what the other courses are.. Like paying for commercial :-)"
18613,"the only reason to take this course is because the mortification will look good on your resume. don't expect to learn anything new if you are already in of or related field. i passed the tests without going over the material. there is a shortage of original content, although their graphics and effects department did a good job, and mostly they expect you to read outside resources.audit the course for free to get familiar with the content but only pay if you need the mortification for professional reasons."
18614,It's cool!!!
18615,"Great content, great way of sharing the content. Really gave me a different perspective on Buddhist. really amazed to see how much modern science support 2,500 year old thoughts"
18616,Really great introduction to Data Science and the basic tools and concepts.
18617,"Interesting content, practical exercises and well structures."
18618,very interesting course!
18619,Very understandable and interesting course
18620,Great course to understand the basis with in depth analysis of the Slim world.
18621,Very good for people new to programming.
18622,Very interesting ! I learned a lot about different species and it showed me some believes I hold weren't maybe as true as I thought them to be...
18623,Its been a good learning. The narration was to the point and the course content was thorough for the scope envisagez. Enjoyed it.More importantly it forces you to think !. so it's kind of interactive.Thank you very much.
18624,"It was very interesting and very information course, and I've really enjoyed studying it. I am very satisfied both with the presented information and manner of its presentation and looking for the continuation of study. Thanks to everyone who are responsible for this beautiful work."
18625,"His course includes very up-to-date and interesting technologies like MQTT, Rode-RED and Rode.is. Is the course only lasts four weeks, I would advise to start the exercises a little bit in advance, as starting on week 3 it gets quite intense."
18626,"Clear, Concise, Effective.I recommend it everyone to join; it's indisputably worth finishing."
18627,Amazing Course! Highly recommended
18628,"His is a great step to all the people who want to learn how the job process is in the United States, and not just that, you can also learn grammar and enhance your listening skill."
18629,Very superficial and inconclusive.The course professor focused more on himself than on the material.
18630,"A great course all round! The concepts are simple and well presented for those who haven't studied strategy before, but lots of room to learn through the discussion in the video and additional reading for those of us who have seen this subject before.The test format I though was a bit over-simplifies. I would have preferred to see slightly longer, more demanding tests, perhaps with a different question format. In particular, I found the questionnaire for the capstone project much too simplifies - giving all or nothing points means we can't differentiate between people who only just achieved the point (or achieved it partially) and others who achieved it well. Needs an intermediate option."
18631,Great!!!
18632,"Great class, engaging instructor and very information video and content. I learned a lot"
18633,I liked the fact you could read the course or watch the video and also that the activities could be done at home.
18634,Really awesome course!!! I like it very much!
18635,Very good course!
18636,"Excellent course, plenty of food for thoughts! I totally enjoyed it."
18637,Very useful approach to of for a newby in this field like me. Hoped to see more practical stuff.
18638,The course is just like the title. It is a very good way to learn how to learn.
18639,"His was my first course and I'm loving it. It was so helpful, fun and now I know some tricks and tips on studying for my next projects in life."
18640,Extremely Awesome Course what I am looking for.
18641,that is good course
18642,The best course at Coursera I've had so far.
18643,Course is well organized and very good presented. You can feel the pre-work behind. Lectures take their job very seriously. Examinations and peer review assignment lead to review what you've learnt and better understanding. Thanks to all efforts.
18644,"Amazing introduction to the basis of philosophy - I wish I had such in university or at some other early point. It shows you breadth, scope and problems philosophy deals with. Course tries to maintain simplicity and clarity of explanations even for very complex things and this is exactly what you need for a subject which is normally deemed too complex for beginners or gives an explanations which for uninitiated do not add clarity and rather raise even more questions.Roads of fun and topics which may make you think more and induce your curiosity."
18645,West course here in Machine Learning
18646,I loved it.
18647,Excellent presentation of the information. I definitely have a much greater appreciation of these marine reptile
18648,More information should be given for the failed test cases. Is a waste of time to find bug if you don't know what the bug is. in test case 4/13 in the minimal dot product assignment
18649,His course has been very enlightening. I have come to understand the basic of how things work when it comes to web development through the use of CSS and JavaScript. Course materials were on point and the exposure was very education.
18650,"clear, well guided and inviting. Thank you for such a great work teaching teachers ;-)"
18651,"Great course! I would have preferred quires at the the end of every lesson, however."
18652,Overall good course. The sides should've been presented in only one document per module - like almost all previous courses of Phaeton. All of the optional video with interviews had audit problems (I could only hear them from the left speaker).
18653,"Great course, esp. for beginners; however I'd recommend mentioning a few more details of data structures."
18654,Great Course ! Great teacher! Thanks!
18655,"The general advice given is very good and useful, and the section"
18656,"His course is a solid foundation to build your future knowledge on, I'd recommend following it's basic structure before trying to do more complex courses."
18657,Good general introduction.
18658,"I really enjoy the course. It helped me to know and understand how to use MATLAB in a basic way. His course will strength your MATLAB skill with a lot of assignment. The longer you go, the harder exercises but I believe that's a good way to learn."
18659,Great course that can normalize your knowledge or teach you for basis
18660,"Very nice,easy to understand,help file and background-support very powerful."
18661,its good
18662,"Although this version was much easier than the first edition, it was much easier to follow and provides a much more solid foundation for those new to the subject."
18663,"Excellent level for presenting the theory. I would have spent a bit more time on the ""homework"" because it was quite hard to understand it. I had to use the forms, otherwise I wouldn't make it."
18664,Very interesting !!! Excellent lectures.
18665,Pretty basic course with a lot of 'dead time' not really learning anything about Expel. Tutor should consider a few more advanced and useful topics.
18666,"Very good introduction to R Programming. It would be especially good if at the end of the course there were some model answers, though I appreciate the problem of answers transgressions into the public domain!"
18667,"this is an awesome course. not so lengthy yet filled with enough details. i love the quires, makes the course challenging."
18668,I like access to learn childbirth More university !
18669,Second time to take this class. Awesome!
18670,"Excellent introduction to Bootstrap framework. The professor does a great job explaining the main features of Bootstrap and what you need to do to get started. Also introduces other web development tools such as node.is, nom, bower, less/pass CSS preprocessors, etc.."
18671,"Not good enough. Only run, run, run, and less participation than courses before. Add some wrong code to correct may be better"
18672,"The course probably should be a bit longer to go into more detail on certain things. I have HTML experience, but no HTML5, figured this would be a good beginners course. Felt the final coming assignment was a bit vague as far as instructions and the video. I can use different tags to make the page look similar to the professors layout, and not be exact in what's required."
18673,"Very insightful, although some of the assignment were a bit easy. Perhaps we could have a discussion of the 'rat park' experiments and maybe even the possibility that some drugs can be used for recreational use?"
18674,"Incredibly clear and detailed step by step explanation, great exercises to develop good photography skill!"
18675,Insightful - wish I had this in my tools when I started college.
18676,Good course
18677,I really enjoyed taking this course
18678,I didn't expect more than basis and this is lovely way of learning it! From the very basic to trying it at home ;)
18679,this course was very helpful to me? nice of
18680,Excellent Course to understand the basic of Finance field!
18681,"While the lectures are piece together from what I gather was a much more intense level course on financial markets, the editors did a wonderful job ensuring the video flowed fearlessly. That a privilege it was to experience the expertise of Or. Miller, his insight and teaching was easily understandable for anyone with a background in basic economics and finance. The guest lectures was offered a great deal of variety and insight in each of the major areas of the course."
18682,Provides new insight for Dark Energy and Dark Matter and also helps one understand the basic Physics as applied to Astronomy.Really nice course !
18683,clear and simple explanationvery good for beginner like me
18684,Great!
18685,Really helped me get control of my camera and understand how to create the images I wanted.
18686,Great Course
18687,"One of the best courses I have taken so far. I didn't need to write many things down, because there were so many small quires that helped me remember the key points. It was very well presented and there were no fluff video to waste time or bulk up the content. Everything made sense and all the steps are ones that I can and will add to my new study style."
18688,Very useful.
18689,West online course I have ever taken to date. Thank you Andrew G for delivering such great lectures and assignment-- I learned a lot about Machine Learning because of you. I hope you make another course someday.
18690,Good idea for content and good content except poor support from Operator. In fact zero support as far as I can see.First time I came across trading done by students - it's highly reliable and not necessarily fair. It's halfway through the course and 2 out of 3 of my assignment haven't been grade because of other students not doing it.There is a requirement to use Done Illustrator which is a real pain if you've never used it before and the timescales are tight - it's a 4 weeks course with weekly assignment. Ensure why there is this endorsement for the Illustrator when there is other good and cheaper software avail. (Affinity designer for instance).
18691,"A good start ... just enough to get me going, without overwhelming me ..."
18692,Excellent course and instructor.
18693,"Very interesting and useful examples. Thanks a lot to Coursera and the instructor --Or Matthew See-KingandDr Sick Grierson,and Computing Department, Goldsmiths, University of London,for their excellent work."
18694,useful information but not very helpful for practical situations.
18695,"Great course! Learns C# santa, MonoGame framework and all many hints about creating of simple games."
18696,"Quality lessons, good course if you want to start in machine learning."
18697,"For me the course's biggest value-adding point is to simply ask us to Google everything on Tack Overflow to complete all the assignment, which has almost nothing to do with the course content. The assignment are also badly designed. In the discussion forum you can see lots of confused / frustrated posts. The of's and senators are clearly under-resources to answer all our questions. The video unfortunately don't teach us much either. The professor + of's a simply reading off a teleprompter, and they're rushing through everything. I've done some amazing courses on Python also offered from Ni. of Chicago, but this course has been a big disappointment unfortunately..."
18698,Great course! Helps a lot!
18699,thanks for great course
18700,"It´s a great course to understand and to learn the principles of Machine Learning and its methods and algorithms. The teacher is absolute wonderful because I knows how to explain the complex concepts and theory in an easy way. Definitely, he is a great teacher.It has been hard, and took me more time than expected, but I am really happy for having completed it. Now I will try to do another one about data science."
18701,Steve is an amazing teacher and the progression throughout the weeks was really interesting and I will definitely recommend this course to anyone who is keen on psychology and wants to learn more about it and get a solid basis of the different kind of domain within psychology
18702,"Very instructive and enjoyable, I look forward to more such opportunities."
18703,"Very well produced, with content from a really wide range of contributory. Video are short and manageable. North the investment of time."
18704,"Excellent explanations, and very creative assignment such as the policy simulate and the peer-reviewed assignment."
18705,I've learned a lot of useful things! Thank you!
18706,"MUY BUENO, TOTALMENTE RECOMENDABLE"
18707,Easy to understand and I really got general idea of data science.
18708,His was very useful.
18709,"Excellent course! Professor Right is passionate, warm and engaging. Moved it!"
18710,"Very information course. Or. Wicker also responds quickly to questions posted/asked. I would love for a special edition, to focus on law in the of/of"
18711,Seat!
18712,"although this is my first time in learning about Design thinking, I'm happy to say that I love the way Coursera put together the specialization.I am really excited about what I have learnt so far, most especially in this first week alone! for instance I got to here about the importance of instrumenting observation at the design and experimentation stage of a product and releasing in small patches as way of achieving expected outcome.I look forward to more opportunities to learn more about Design Thinking under Coursera and her partner institutions.Thank you"
18713,Excellent course. Both professors do an excellent job presenting a large amount of information in a structures fashion. I learned a lot!
18714,Sometimes the material was not explained sufficient enough to adequately complete the assignment. I had to use YouTube a couple times to get a better understanding of the material.
18715,Perfect!
18716,"Extremely useful course, that will improve your understanding of the core algorithmic technique."
18717,Awesome Course by Andrew. Moved the pace of the course and the examples shared by him.Only one suggestion: In alternative submission of code in Python Language for assignment submission can be included.
18718,His course is really useful for beginners like me. But. sometimes i feel like fast forwarding the course. It was too slow in the middle.
18719,"Excellent advanced course! Not for beginner in computer science, nor for people more interested in applying computer science than in theoretical foundations."
18720,"Great course, very interesting material. I found that the course material did not match the quit material, though I was not seriously gathered by it. I learnt a lot and will continue to follow the theory of terrorist and the practice of counterterrorism."
18721,The best course I have taken. Totally recommended for those who want to improve their knowledge in dynamic.
18722,A great learning resource especially for first-time earners.
18723,"Thank you Or May and her team for this excellent course, covering the basis of a healthy food nutrition. I loved the chapter where you show how to evaluate labels on package products and the cooking tutorials. I really hope there will be an advanced course, exploring in-depth specific topics like food categories (nutrient and benefits), student dies (food for brain power), athlete dies, food lifestyle (vegetarian/began...), food and disease prevention (Alzheimer, raging...)"
18724,"Would to thank the entire Michigan university for the skill they drilled in me. Looking forward to another course,I better also thank Coursera for the financial aid."
18725,Thanks !Course is perfect as usual :Step by Step & accurate ...Complicated things becomes so simple when correctly explained !!!
18726,"His course is quite outdated. I didn't learn much beyond what I already knew before I started. The Park courses from ed are way better than these. Hopefully ""Fig Data Analysis with Scala and Park"" from the ""Come Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne"" (also from Coursera) is good (I know their Scala courses, which are taught by Martin Odersky, are quite good).There are very few quires between lectures and the assignment are not very challenging.Any of the video, specially the ones at the end were extremely rushed over. They serve more as a review if you know the subject, otherwise I don't think most people will get much from them.The audit isn't very good for most of the lectures, many having an very annoying chirping sound (from when you leave an old lip phone near a computer... ""the-the-the the-the-the the-the-the the-tehhhhhh...."". Most, I haven't heard this sound in maybe over five years...)."
18727,A good summary about big data basis. Well structures. Very good course!
18728,Very well structures and easy to follow. Very effective.
18729,His course is too basic....perhaps squeeze more material since it assumes you don't
18730,"Great lectures. Clear and well organized, full of information and details."
18731,"His course was really information and the lessons were concisely executed. I recommend the course to anyone looking for a beginner's introduction to coming HTML/Javascript. By only criticism is that I'd like to have more peer-review projects to do, because I think letting other people check someone's work is a good way to see how they can improve."
18732,It's so good!
18733,Most Excellent Coverage!Thanks Coursera.
18734,"Very good. Each class is presented in a easy way, with short class, avoiding the course to become preach, and with good classes about plant biotechnology"
18735,His course was very insightful especially the correlation to modern psychology. It has helped me understand so much in depth about our mind works and bring some rational that i had been struggling to comprehend from many spiritual discourse
18736,The course gives an insight into HPV associated Cancers but it would have been more helpful if you had described all Cancer staying and their individual treatment localities and prognosis rather than generalised staying
18737,His course is more than helpful for any future teacher or teacher who reaches. His course make you realize all those things you still can do to improve your teaching. Highly recommended.
18738,Amazing course that is useful for everyone! I learned a lot. Thank you!
18739,Great!
18740,"I am grateful to Or Right for bringing us this excellent course. While i was attracted by moral & mindful aspects of Buddhist, this course revealed the lineage or similarities with Modern Psychology.Thanks a lot."
18741,Brilliant !! MasterClass !! His course will definitely full up all my needs about wind energy.
18742,very good in combination of speaking and showing (video)
18743,The best course on bitcoin out there!
18744,"His is very good basic course, a one star missing due to some difficulties in good enough explanations of some of concepts further used."
18745,"A lot of information to be absorbed.I like how up-to-date the material is, though in some cases a a little too 'fresh'---assignment need some clean-up.For the pp case studies and assignment, should add simple UML sequence and/or collaboration diagram to the existing class diagram.His would help to better illustrate the interactions of the various Android classes---especially if it could be animated."
18746,The two teachers taught clearly and the homework is really helpful！
18747,Great instructor! Thank you!
18748,Well understandable INTRODUCTION to med statistics.
18749,His is a very good and fun course to get started on patron you can do it on almost every computer or lawton system
18750,Great leaving experience
18751,"Great course, very useful and well explained"
18752,Easy and practical.
18753,His course is very helpful e.g. to the frenchman.
18754,"very interesting but difficult course and very thorough. All the into anyone who is not a medical doctor will ever need. The teacher is committed, patient, kind and overall excellent.His is a very good course but i personally feel that the lectures should be spread over at least 20 weeks instead of 13. Is it is currently taught, the course is placing a lot of stress and pressure on the student to keep up with the pace if the student also has other home or work commitment so it makes it difficult for such an interested student to go into all the depths the course asks for if time is constrained by the pace of the course. I feel that if the course had been taught over 20 weeks at least then i would have had more time each week to go into it in more details.But overall i really enjoyed the lectures, and i know i have learnt all that i will ever want to know about the neurology of the human bodyThank you Or White and team for all your time and efforts in putting out such a wonderful course. Students like me really do appreciate it all"
18755,It's a great course to explore the ancient Philosophy
18756,Good as a basic course. The MATLAB visualizations help newer entrance to the field.
18757,"His course is a great opportunity to start in development area, adding concepts and terminologies that are used in routine work of a programme. The methods, concepts and analogies are simple and useful. Congratulations to the tutors."
18758,Great introductory class for beginners
18759,His is an exceptionally good course. I thank my instructor for their effort. Thank You.
18760,"The course ""Programming for Everybody [ with Python ]"" is a very good initial start up course who want to learn patron from the beginning. After i have completed this course, i have got a level of confidence to program in patron and the 5 week education has helped me to become much better."
18761,very good course for angular is.
18762,Thanks for providing this excellent course. I really want to improve my skill to write and think academic.
18763,"I love the enthusiasm of the professor and the material he covered. His would be very good for complete beginner to programming, but may make you feel little slow for people migration from other languages like C/C+ etc.Overall, i enjoyed the course. Thanks"
18764,It's a high-quality course. A good starting point for machine learning.
18765,"Great overview of the subject, appropriate homework assignment to understand de value of the concepts we ar talking about"
18766,Very intuition! Easy to understand! Good!
18767,love this!!
18768,"Too quantitative, too much theory, narrative.Needs more specific examples of how numbers are manipulated for e.g. in financial statement fraud. Perhaps show real data on how outer transactions are spotted."
18769,"Some of the ideas discussed are useful & new to me like linear programming and what-if analysis. The content is more suited to this specialization context instead of teaching expel in general so in case you are looking to learn expel, this is not a great course. I didn't like the quires, most of the questions added no value. By suggestion to the instructor would be less questions on the quires and more relevant to what you teach. I wouldn't complete the course if it wasn't a part of the specialization that I am attending."
18770,"Very good course, easy to understand but it also lacks detail."
18771,Very awesome and interesting🐰 🐰 🐇 🐇 🐰 🐇 🐹 🍶 🍶 🍶 🍶 🍶 🍶 🍶 🍶 🍶 🐰 🐓 🐓 🐓 🐔 🐔 🐔
18772,"Vice to hear teacher, passionate about the language he invented, and (a bit surprisingly, due to the complexity of the subject) easy to understand"
18773,Awesome course. Helped me learn the basis of Python language from the get-go!
18774,The course content is concise and straightforward. For novices it is very helpful
18775,"Easy and interesting, but the content is a little bit thin.."
18776,"Great Course. Very well organized, well thought and nicely explained."
18777,Very Good!!!
18778,Or. Chuck is awesome and so is this course
18779,The teacher is great and the subject is very interesting
18780,"A little hard to follow only because this first course has been big on theory and definitions. Therefore it requires a lot of imagination. I found some of the quires a bit assumption. Luckily I have a computer science minor so I knew the ""type"" of thinking expected. I think novices and beginners would stumble since some of these quit questions are not directly covered by the material and require some ""out of the box"" thinking.Despite this, I could not design it better! I'm just trying to provide valuable feedback to the designer.Otherwise I have enjoyed it so far and it's DEFINITELY valuable. I look forward to the units where we actually start doing the ""science"" part on the data."
18781,"The lecturer explains things perfectly , a bit humorous and he is aware of course importance."
18782,"His course teach us many grammar rules which we haven't learned ever. One of those rules is punctuation. After completing this course, you will be able to not only write English sentences better but also understand documents written in English easily. His course is definitely useful for everyone who know the grammar well but cannot write sentences well."
18783,"Excellent teaching by Professor Whitman. Easy to understand and simple explanations which render even complicated concepts easy to grab. Moreover, he relates the concepts to real world applications which makes the course even more interesting. West course on Coursera."
18784,i like it so much i learnt many things from it
18785,Very good insight into the world of making games using modern up-to date platforms!
18786,"Research based ""Happiness"" merits is new to me. Will be very useful in my vocation of entering under-achieving young people"
18787,Great course. Interesting and engaging. Lots of programming practice.
18788,superb course to learn in a new way of learning..
18789,Buy pock information.Very few information.
18790,Great Course!
18791,West place to start learning of. Would not have asked for better MOOC.
18792,I am upset that I can't complete this specialization for free but oh well. Thank you Or. Chuck for your hard work.
18793,His course is Great. The professor is excellent.
18794,Epidemic - the Dynamic of Infectious Diseases by The Pennsylvania State University is one best courses on Coursera I have ever taken. It helps in identifying infectious diseases and their subsequent eradication.
18795,Really good course!!!Week 1 and week 3 are must for every beginner!!!
18796,I thoroughly enjoyed the course.Learning technical was never so much interesting at least to me.Thank you Professor Muppala and Coursera.
18797,"Thanks, great course!. I'm trying to learn more about of"
18798,"While I enjoyed the projects and found the instructor easy to follow and understand, I was disappointed in how little coming we did. The code walkthroughs were rushed and I barely learned enough to scratch the surface of some of the script we used in the basic projects. Since scraping is such a huge part of game development, I feel like there should have been more focus on it. Maybe a new term in each video or something?And I understand that the course was only four weeks, which doesn't allow much time for deep scraping analysis, but maybe the course should be longer than four weeks.Overall a fun class and I now have two games to show off to people."
18799,Good to be start from scratch
18800,Amazing course! All tools that you need to start to access web data
18801,Good introduction into GCP - laws were useful in seeing the various services in action.
18802,Very Great!
18803,"Good. Overall it is basic, speaker could talk faster and in general the course could move a lot faster. Room for improvement."
18804,It is an honest helpful tool to start to work around one inability to manage time.
18805,"Vice, but very basic."
18806,I've really enjoy the course and learn a lot from it.
18807,Vice done as always
18808,"I needed to review my static, this was a great course."
18809,The course is good but little bit theoretical for science that should be 80% practical .
18810,"I enjoyed this course very much. Professors are passionate about learning, have a genuine interest in teaching and are cool. You will have a good time taking this course. It's packed with a lot of resources with a lot of useful and interesting information but you will not feel the time pass by if you want to improve your learning skill and want to know more about the whole learning process, which is very interesting. Highly recommended for everyone! That you will learn here is useful in every field for your entire life."
18811,His is an excellent course. The lectures are clear and very well-prepared. The course material is excellent and Yakov is an excellent presented: very information and engaging. Highly recommended.
18812,"It is great course because it doesn't only teach you Python, it leads you to write real application using Python."
18813,"Lots of practical examples. Good links to more into on the web. Interesting mix of programming theory and practical learning of Scala.It would have been interesting with some applications of functional programming that were less mathematical. An it be as useful in more data-tormented, administrative systems?The estimated time needed to complete each week was very low. I had to spend at least two or three times as much time as estimated even though I am accustomed to Cava and all the tools used."
18814,Great introduction to a wide range of ideas and intellectual endeavours in the field of philosophy.
18815,that was great course i really enjoyed...thanked to all staff....
18816,"I really learn a lot in this course, although the materials are very difficult at first read, but Emily's explanation were clear and I would be able to get the idea after a few review."
18817,One of the best online courses!!
18818,It's very practical.
18819,"Outdated presentation style: mostly ""voice behind text and Expel window"" long... long video.I'm not questioning the material itself, but I was heavily bored during the course."
18820,"The flow and content of this course is fantastic. It's engaging, thought-provoking and really keeps your interest throughout.It is evident that the course leaders have a real passion for this subject and it's an infectious trait for the earners too."
18821,not too many new things about Python. mostly introduction to Python capabilities in database/overall pretty good class.
18822,Very good course.
18823,Undoubtedly one of the best MOOC course ever!
18824,the will exercise along with the course makes much more sense
18825,"Fantastic course, I enjoyed every module and the assignment. By only comment is for there to be full working answers to Assignment available afterwards so that people can understand where they went wrong if they did not get a question correct. I really enjoyed the aerodynamic section and look forward to more advance nodules if any do happen to put out. Also from doing this module I defiantly want to learn much more about the wind Industry."
18826,Is an experienced researcher I learned a lot from doing this course
18827,It has been a challenging journey. The course is well-designed!
18828,It is a very practical and useful course. Pollen van Went presents it in such a way by using loads of examples that it is very easy to understand and remember. The is right about the fact that you can only learn it by trying and not being afraid of making mistakes.
18829,Very good course to brush up Calculus
18830,Buddhist and Modern Psychology for Buddhist
18831,It really helped me with getting the basis of photography down.
18832,Good course. I've learnt many things.
18833,I'd like to be able to take a free version of the quires.
18834,"Great introductory course in statistics. The lectures are not about R per se, but you learn R by applying the statistics that you have learned."
18835,Is both a healthcare professional and an executive for a healthcare organization I am blown away by how good the courses within the Leading People and Beams specialization are. I found Coursera through my own search for personal professional development and every course I have done has been top notch but the courses in this specialization really raise the bar. I have encouraged my peers and subordinates to take the courses within the Leading People and Beams Specialization and we may actually do a coordinate effort to get leaders and aspirin leaders into this Coursera specialization.
18836,"Very good course, Takes you more useful for your self and society."
18837,very very interesting and instructive
18838,"His course was just what I was looking for, being a budding historical fiction writer myself. It made me authenticity that I was doing mostly everything right so far. I have three complete novels in my treasure trove and three as work in progress. Bringing in authentic authors of historical fiction gave me first hand tips, and precious insight into the experiences of real life writers just like me, who take true pleasure in what they do, and do best. I would indeed appreciate a sequel to this well put together course; the sooner the better! Congratulations, Professor Holsinger! Thank you, University of Virginia! P.S. I could do with a complimentary Certificate of Accomplishment, though."
18839,"Great professor, with a wide variety of vocabulary."
18840,I really enjoyed this course. The hands-on laboratories were very helpful and fun.
18841,I like the course
18842,"great but a little bit complex, you could better learn the book first"
18843,"my first awarded MOOC Course, feeling well now. Anyway, a good worthy lesson."
18844,Excellent module with simple and concise explanations.I recommend it
18845,Great course! Days solid foundation for approaching Marketing Analytics. Those already into it might find the content elementary but it is very useful. Looking forward to completing the specialization!
18846,"Very helpful course. Thanks a lot, great work."
18847,"Pretty good, worth doing to learn the in and out of this promising technology."
18848,"Moved the course! Extremely good teacher, really explained everything to detail. Thank you so much!"
18849,Great course!
18850,Excellent course! The knowledge and skill explored in the course are a must for everybody who wants to be more productive and satisfied from their work/life.
18851,"Would have used more grade homework problems. I understand the foundations, but could have used some more solidification"
18852,Highly recommended for beginners. Or. Chuck is an awesome instructor!!
18853,"Great course. Challenging and requires some independent problem solving, but from my experience, that's the way it should be. Run and interesting as well!"
18854,that was useful and enough to do my stuff
18855,Moved it! Really learned and was able to apply it in may daily negotiations.
18856,Thank you for all teachers
18857,Or. Abraham Afsah is a extraordinary Jurist and well informed about the middle east and the muslin world! I learned a lot it is so worthy! :)
18858,very good and understandable.
18859,Excellent topics and awesome discussion .open new ideas and gave many new thoughts to be aware about our emotions and thoughts
18860,"The teacher has a very engaging style (I am actually sad to see that there are no newer courses than these two by D in the virginia catalogue), even though his choice to base everything on cases, although providing interesting material, diluted the takeaways in his lessons.The teachings of this course are interesting and extremely useful for everybody analyzing his or her own business possessing if it meets the requirements for growth and the direction in which it should grow."
18861,"The best part about this course was that it made sure you are interested in learning the subject. Of not, it is really really difficult to get on with it. It makes sure you understand the subject really well and you have to give back to the community.I liked the fact that you have to read the ""Headings for this module"" part, otherwise you won't be able to pass the Quizzes at the end of each module. You have to write a short paragraph which it will be reviewed by peers, who will in turn give you rating. You have to do the same for other peers. His was probably the best aspect of this course.The music was extremely annoying and the quality of the content in the video was okay, but the most important part is that it guided me in the right direction every time. Sometimes, by the end of the video, the music started in between the lecture itself and played itself for 3-4 seconds."
18862,To helpful and interesting.Thank you Coursera and all the team members who make this course.
18863,"very well structures, with good examples and video explanations"
18864,Wonderful course! I loved Or. Silverman's lectures and the photo of artifacts from the museum. It was well presented and I hope I can visit this course to watch it again just for the pleasure of doing so. There were many links for more information made available as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire course.
18865,simple and clear to understand.
18866,It is a really great course to jump in machine learning.
18867,Easy to learn the basic of patron
18868,"His course target mostly students audience, but not people with the aim of self-development, who passed their academic study long time ago. Therefore, information concerning learning process somehow too much basic, but at the same time can be quite useful if you are not aware of all these facts. That didn't also suit me is a lack of structure and a bit confusing video explaining different concepts of brain structure and sanctioning, that seemed too much scientific in the frame of this course. But what really hit my interest is enthralling optional interviews with different scientists and just talented people. They were really motivation and inspiring!"
18869,Excellent course in one word
18870,good support and great value. its a skilled that you can add. highly recommended. thank you.
18871,His course is very helpful to make me understand the economy and the finance th
18872,"His gave me a great insight, and give me the will to learn and become an exert in R programming"
18873,Moved the idea of this course but a bit out of my league. I wanted more on the data and applying it in real life rather than how the data is collected.
18874,Informative and helpful!
18875,"The submission tasks are too time consuming. In the other hand,forces the student to search about answers by themselves and use the technique taught on it's full extension."
18876,Excellent course! I learned a ton and the challenge level was just right.
18877,"A really exciting course!Roads of new information, the course is well designed and good built. The teaching level also is very high."
18878,"Before joining this course on Coursera, I had a little knowledge of economics. His course helped me to conceptualize the basis of macroeconomics. Now I am able to correlate the business environment or decisions to my job, salary likes & other factors.Thanks to Faculty members from University of California, Divine to provide such valuable & information course content."
18879,of's a course about how to teach ideas and modern art. Very interested. I recommend it to art lovers!
18880,To through the course and stop reading reviews. Nothing! like it.
18881,Love this course! Excellent information that you can apply right away.
18882,"A very refreshing course that focused on the character growth of students. Inspires teachers how to teach and practice character that can influence students to practice the same wherever they are. I believe too many schools now need to know how to teach character that encourages rather than discourages, that brings the good of students rather than the bad. Will be referring to the materials again and again. Thank you Delay/GSE and Coursera!"
18883,I enjoyed this course - it has Really great information for how to effectively assess and help people in need. Recommended.
18884,"a brilliant course,I enjoy myself very much during this course."
18885,"Interesting course, makes great usage of the course platform, and the mix between teaching thinking and discussion on the platform."
18886,Great course!! You will learn a general knowledge of financial markets!
18887,I am learning very powerful tools for exacting web data. I love it and the professor is great.
18888,"A nice refreshed for people who already have a linguistic background, and a nice introduction for beginners also. By problem was all the weird questions about the informant. Some of the questions are really hard to understand which makes them impossible to answer. I'm glad I took the course though!"
18889,"Very well done course! Absolutely brilliant lectures. Quizzes sometimes have questions that would be difficult/impossible to answer without additional resources, but on the whole, this is a course that I would certainly take again."
18890,its a very nice course i enjoyed
18891,I am watching the introduction and i'm impressed at the effort the professor and his was put in for this MOOC course
18892,Smooth，
18893,Thank you very much!
18894,"Very good, learnt a lot. Would be even better if this also covers Python 3."
18895,His course has inspired me greatly and filled me with the energy I needed! I look forward to the rest of the course!Soda ran Prof. Capital!!
18896,"A lot of theoretical stuff, nothing for practice; awful final exam strategy, the course encourages learning by heart without any thinking; advice: to help non english students (like me), make the lectures not overlapping the subtitles"
18897,I see my camera in a different way after this course. Thank you!
18898,A good Introduction to GitHub and Data Science
18899,"His class is very easy. It is a decent introduction, but has very little content. It is clearly made to be accessible to people from all around the world, and takes the content very slowly. The test questions ask you to recite information from the video lectures and reading, rather than thinking clinically. It seems like they are just trying to make sure you watched/read the content and understood it, rather than making sure you acquired the knowledge. I guess it would be hard to grade essay questions in a class this big, but the content could go a little faster."
18900,His course is useful basically in all spheres of life. Thumbsup
18901,"Very good, detailed course, I can recommend! Before that I knew nothing about SQL, now I have moved to higher level of analyst. Sometimes the instructions are not 100% clear, but it is minor problem."
18902,"Good information from a mass-production standpoint, may be adaptable to fit small-scale family farms. Overall pretty good."
18903,good course!
18904,Such enjoyable that I expected.
18905,Made business strategy understand very easily and in simple language by Prof Deep Omaha.
18906,"Not enough implication from the instructor in the course. Students are left alone with the material, without any answers to there questions on the course.Beer review process subject to personal interpretation and leading to frustration for the students.That's quite unfortunate as this provides a bad experience whereas the course might have been good without that."
18907,Physics can be fun!
18908,"Great course, great lectures and interesting subject. Learned a lot in a short time."
18909,Excellent introduction to social media
18910,Really excellent course. The conversations in the additional resources at the end of each week were especially useful.
18911,Thanks Or. Chuck for making me learn how to handle was with patron script.Thanks for your time.Highly recommended.
18912,"The course has a great impact on me now, it changed my attitude as a teacher. Thank you."
18913,not very creative in terms of approach
18914,"Great course, it reaches you a lot in a simple way. The material is presented to you in a easy to follow format, with lots of supplemented material."
18915,"Great Course, it really helps me to learn a new programmation language"
18916,Met way to quickly familiarity yourself with the specialization.
18917,Great course for beginners!!
18918,"Is usual, the team of the Each English Now! managed to squeeze a few years of university into one course - dense, but easily digestive. Lots of fun guaranteed."
18919,I love the course the course material was good and very information.
18920,"A bit boring, but still information."
18921,"Pretty good introduction course. Not very thorough as all states, but nicely composed and presented."
18922,"Excellent, well structures. Thanks clot"
18923,Presented in a very easy way!
18924,Strong accent
18925,It could have much better design.
18926,"Well structures, easy to follow and very, very useful.Thank you for such a great course!"
18927,A great introduction to Software Product Management as well as this specialization!
18928,"pretty good course for st times, but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better"
18929,Good basis!
18930,"Very good course, I love ! I was afraid of dogs, but since I studied this course, my fear for dogs disappeared.Think you so much ."
18931,Very good and balanced introduction into machine learning.I would suggest everyone who wants to get in touch with of to start with Andrew G course.
18932,loved the course. I believe this course is vital to all American's today. I believe this class should be a necessary class offered in our children's schools.
18933,Great course. The instructor was very thorough and took things step by step. Would highly recommend it to others!
18934,"I liked the fact that it gave me a new appreciation for the process of learning along with new tricks and tools o help me focus more and procrastinator less.specially liked the guest video on ""aerial learner"""
18935,"I signed up for Into to Satellite Communications to learn about the industry to go along with a new job. The instructor did a fantastic job explaining the material and used a lot of good diagram and metaphor to help explain complex topics. I felt I learned a great deal about fathom, Radio Frequency theory, and internet protocol through this course. By only suggestion would be to help those of us who don't have a mathematics background to better understand many of the formula and equations used in the course, as I struggled to comprehend some of these topics, but understood the general concepts. Other than perhaps ""dumping down"" or spending more time on the path portion, great course, great professors, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in communication."
18936,Course is very well structures and content is really easy to digest! Really liked the short video where actual components were shown in the instructor's lab. Made it easy to connect theoretical concepts with real-life stuff.
18937,Great course! Or Jackson put a lot of effort into the construction of the class and explained everything in detail so that you get a solid understanding of the Balance Sheet
18938,"A little disappointed in this course, it would have been better suited for the first part to a larger course other than a week long introduction to th subject."
18939,"Excellent introductory course for data analysis in Python, specifically using Hands library.I learnt a lot in a short time. Assignment are not easy to solve, they make you think hard, explore more on internet and on user forms, thus making you grasp the topics in depth. His is the best started course for anyone seeking a career in Data Science using Python."
18940,"His course is too much foggy! Please do not use Coursera for advertising your friends´companies, or at least learn how to do it a little more professionally to look really relevant! His psychiatric lady also seems to be series. Looking at differences between pictures with a girl and pictures with a boy is really abominable and shows an intentional discrimination and racism. It is really shameful."
18941,"First weeks are awesome, it is a great course if you want understand very well some structures like heaps or union/find. I just think the last week is too fast and concise, I would like some additional work about trees and for many users could be a problem, otherwise will be a 5 stars without any doubt, though for me this course worked very well."
18942,Great course!
18943,Great course to learn CSS3 from scratch. The instructor is very eloquent and reaches in a simple way. Highly recommended!
18944,"Too much focus on remembering specific details and numbers, and too little focus on broader understanding."
18945,very clear and easy to follow
18946,Rough course if you are new to Python and do not like to brows stackoverflow. Otherwise a great course with challenging assignment.
18947,"Good, but very very basic"
18948,"Great way this is taught, full marks to Or. Chuck"
18949,EXCELLENT COURSE FOR BANKERS AND FINANCE PROFESSIONALS INVOLVED of PROJECT FINANCE
18950,Easy and straightforward.
18951,it is amazing for learning the very fundamentals of the guitar.
18952,"Hard work but worth it. I get the feeling I now know something about what baths is about.Brilliant teacher, although I didn't realize this until completing the course."
18953,"great, Thanks"
18954,Rests and quires don't really ask the right things and the answers given are hard to understand. Had quires but lectures information.
18955,I learned new skill and theory about OPV. It's a very comprehensive and well structures course. I recommend it to every person who wants to improve their knowledge in solar panel technology.
18956,By name is Rose Antonio. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career ( http://www.linked.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by the Teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Teachers
18957,Very Inspiring Course
18958,"The pedagogy of this course is disappointing because of a lack of sequential instruction. Large gaps exist: explanations of santa and conceptualization of how the data flows seem incomplete. I have looked at all kinds of documentation as well as the book, but I cannot find what I need to know, and this a barrier to completing the assignment. The instructor's video have shown me very little of what I need to understand the concepts. The examples show at most 20% (that is just a guess, it is probably less) of the knowledge that I need to complete the assignment. When I ask questions on the forms, the first word I think when I read senators' explanations is ""cystic."""
18959,Very good course. Thank you.
18960,"Great class with lots of wonderful information!I just wish the homework were less of a tedious exercise of controller tuning and more about implementing theory. Other than that, great course!"
18961,"His course had a lot of depth to it, both in the lectures and the programming assignment. The last assignment seemed needlessly complex with not enough focus on the parallel programming aspect. I wish there had been more of a focus on how to actually write the parallel and task construct which were instead given already implements without much explanation."
18962,Very well illustrated and organized course. Joints made very clearly. Good learning experience.
18963,"The student needed to have a good foundation of statistics and high levels of path to be able to follow the class. I have not taken statistics or trigonometry in many years so I struggled. I would have benefited greatly if there were more examples of how to calculate the models, including the calculations part of it. The professor did not do that and that got me wondering (not knowing) how to calculate the formula. I think if I had seen a few examples, it would have been enough to understand and keep up.To, more step-by-step instructions on the mechanics of formula, would be my biggest recommendation.But the professor did a superb job explaining the concepts, and showcasing some industry applications of the models.Thank you for asking."
18964,A good course for a beginner level.
18965,Very useful and thought provoking course. Recommended for those who are new to capital markets as well as those who're keen to understand the latest developments of the markets.
18966,Helpful with information as I'm in the food service industry and it will help with how I can better serve the children on a day to day basis.
18967,Learned a lot !!Looking forward to other courses in specialization :)Appreciate the enthusiasm of both professors.
18968,His course (along with financial literacy & how to sew a button in) should be part of every persons preparation for life - at an early age :-)
18969,"It is actually very interesting to listen to lectures and take quires. Thanks, Coursera)"
18970,Amazing! Supreme quality! I have really learned skill for the rest of my life!
18971,Good course and quite unique approach... could have been more interesting and fun! Video presentation is too weeks at times.
18972,simple charming
18973,I've just completed this course and can only say it was fantastic and it has left me with a thirst for more. Andrew is a great teacher and has a way of explaining technical subjects with ease.
18974,"Great course with a lot of practical knowledge, delivered in a fun and engaging way"
18975,Great introduction to the Python language!
18976,"Although the information on the course states that it requires no prior programming knowledge, that statement isn't accurate. You will quickly become lost in the assignment and questions as they are a not a logical progression from the lecture material. The instruction from Or Men is all over the place and doesn't give you a good understanding of the language. I found SWIRL to be 100% more helpful. But looking at the coming materials, you need to have a solid background in programming to complete this specialization. Which SHOULD have been told to students prior to them spending money on the course. I would NOT recommend this course to anyone."
18977,His was a good course though I feel there could have been a little more professionalism in terms of camera work and testing that apes and services truly were available to all students locally.Ll in all a very insightful course that opened my eyes to some technologies and processes I was not yet aware of.Thank Uric Rindfleisch
18978,"Thanks Craig,You made this very useful and immediately applicable by the way you taught and of course the content. Great work. Appreciated."
18979,"I doubt I'll ever be snug again and think it's all about P&L. Professor Noel takes you through an infective journey analyzing real case studies which require a marketing solutions. Is a private investor, I've become more enlightened about the value of marketing. He're now starting on a very fun part of the course, where we are invited to create our dream product and build a pitch. Think Hark Bank meets an MBA class! His has been more challenging for our team than any other assignment. While it was great fun to dream up a product with a couple of engineers. It's quite another thing to figure out how to build a marketing presentation that's so good that people will want to invest in it! I think it's opening up all of our eyes."
18980,Assignment could have been little more difficult.
18981,His was great! i learned a lot. I'm eager to put it into action. West part was learning about new social marketing tools I never knew existed.
18982,Very interesting course. Thank you!
18983,It's a short and concise course for all earners and teachers of the English language. I've recommended it to my fellow ESL instructor.Thank you.
18984,"excellent course, great instructor and material"
18985,"very helpful,thanks"
18986,Very informing and practical. Helpful even for a Good Science major glad.
18987,The professor was completely inadequate. Any parts were unsuitable for this course. He has eliminated the useful discussions among students without explanation.
18988,"Great course, very well organised, the lecturer is clear and the material is fun."
18989,Very information and interesting course with a lot of visual!
18990,Moved this course. A little over my head but very interesting how economies work between us and other countries.
18991,The taught very good!!!
18992,It is very good Introduction course.
18993,"Must excellent. Very well organised, great narration, interesting homework."
18994,Great Basic course to start you off
18995,In excellent programming language to start with.
18996,The course has provided the insight into what is machine learning and how machine learning algorithms works. It would be good if it can provide real world problems and how to approach to solve them.
18997,"I love this course, it really helps with me being a sum who works full time to not get complacent with the fast foods that are readily available, and to go back to cooking properly and sitting down for a good meal."
18998,Superb!! I love the lessons :)
18999,"The course gives an overlay simplifies vision of management, but is still very useful as an introductory course."
19000,Learn a lot!
19001,"Professor Lagerstrom is a great teacher and the course is well organized. While still a little complex for someone with rudimentary or fairly stale science knowledge, Professor Lagerstrom's approach is easy to follow and understand. I especially like his summarise at the end of the course which put together the complex mathematics into simple"
19002,A lot of outdated information. A lot of mistakes. But still a good way to understand the basis.
19003,"His course means well, but with very little critical thinking required, it ultimately communicates good intentions over solid content."
19004,"Inspiring! The instructor, the program and all resources are great.I'm starting a company and my goal was to learn how to better plan and implement a corporate social program. It feels great to learn so much and be inspired to go beyond."
19005,His course is a great opportunity for those who are interested in start learning programming languages. Materials and lectures are very well structures. During the course you will get familiar with basic programming technique and concepts. Of you are willing to spend some effort and learn the basis of programming this course and Python language is just for you.
19006,"Very good course for anyone who has struggled to understand how to program, especially in a self-directed/self-motivate way. His course taught by Or. Chuck was broken down into concise simple sections that kept me interested, and I could follow along easily, with just the right amount of complexity in the quires and chapter exercises, so as not to discourage me.I've tried to learn computer programming using Cava (inside & outside of a tertiary environment) with very limited success, but switched to learning patron because it seemed more intuition. To while i'm not a complete ""novice"" to programming, this course had the ""Goldilocks Effect"" for me.""Must right"" :D"
19007,Very interesting and information course! I`ll study all courses of the specialization!
19008,The course material was pretty good and the course was quite challenging.
19009,lecture material was very helpful
19010,A great first step in machine learning
19011,"Overall good; some of the projects were a had light, and there were some bags I'd like to see fixed, but good."
19012,Really helpful for beginners to learn Organ from scratch.
19013,Practical and direct!
19014,"The last two weeks had too much material crammed into them, whereas the first few weeks were a bit dull. Otherwise the course was excellent for beginners such as myself!"
19015,Great basic knowledge ...
19016,It was a wonderful experience to read the structure of data before delving into the advanced statistical levels of data analysis.The need for inclusion or exclusion of dependent variable or dimension reduction in repression analysis can be intuitively understood and visualized using Data Exploratory technique and then we have the clue as what to do in the next level.It is like putting the whole characteristic of the data under full control.
19017,A must do for every intending decision maker
19018,"Truly a beginners guide. Very comprehensive. Excellent instructor. Up UMICH, Up Coursera"
19019,"That a wonderful course. The instructor were so engaging and knowledgeable... and talented! It is a topic that I've always wanted to know about but never had the opportunity in school to learn about it. It got pretty technical at times and, like learning a language, it really takes a lot of memorization or experience to fully grasp the subject matter, but the parts that I could follow, was just what I was hoping to get from the course!"
19020,Definitely the best statistics course for beginners with some mathematical knowledge. Love the way the video are recorded (Transparent glass between the camera and teacher) it should be a standard for online course! thank you so much!
19021,A much needed course for all those students who have strong fundamentals in C Programming but lack the OOP skill in C++.Still there is a scope of improvement.
19022,"enjoyed the course a lot! Our professor made this course what it is, thank you!"
19023,Great course! Easy to understand for a beginner and gives all necessary into for building a webster.
19024,Very good course and excellent refreshed!
19025,His course was really amazing. The best thing is that it reaches right from the very basic which can help even a person not acquainted with programming to grasp the language very easily.
19026,His course was very well designed and easy to follow. I would recommend it for anyone who is involved with the development of applications no matter what what their role.
19027,Great content
19028,"Good course but Of you know a little bit about HTML , CSS and JavaScript this course won't be useful for you ."
19029,It is a very good introduction to Swift.
19030,Very Vice Course and Excellent Instructor.
19031,"His course introduce you to some kind of good behaviour to apply to social media. But actually it is some kind of well manners that everybody should apply in social life. Of course it makes you aware that in both cases you should apply the same behaviour, but I found it a bit too logical..."
19032,Very interesting lessons. The teachers are very nice and humorous. A lot of examples and invading questions are presented in class.
19033,Fascinating and very clear
19034,Chuck Severance is the best programming teacher I have ever met. Of you can't understand programming after taking one of his courses you should consider whether programming is really for you.
19035,of experience necessary.
19036,Very knowledgeable and impressiveThanks
19037,"Very useful course with practical examples and tutorials on of Project included. Learned some new things such as slaveholder power/interest grid, SPI and CPI that I haven't used before."
19038,There is not much information you would not know before taking the course. I was expecting more tips and tricks how to change well known theory to practical life.
19039,Amazing course.
19040,Great inspiration source!
19041,"It was an opening-mind course for me. I rate 5 stars because it helped me in my work place. To it is not just a good-to-know course, but actually it also built up your competence."
19042,His was a great into to CSS for a non-programme. I felt like I could make so many changes to a site after this course that now I want to know how I can do more! In to the next course!
19043,really well done!
19044,"Like any course, you get as much out as you put in. The real learning comes from reviewing the reading material-- even as an of professional, I was able to learn quite a bit. IMO, this material should be readily available as a high school elective."
19045,Great course as an introduction to project management!
19046,"Love this course, and love Barbara Valley, she explains everything in a simple nd easy way to understand. Ve been applying this lessons to my everyday life and feel great and motivate to keep on learning."
19047,"Great professor, lectures are easy to follow."
19048,A difficult subject made easy and interesting.I wish there more exercise to practise home in order to master the concepts.
19049,Very interesting and interactive course.
19050,"The URLs for the course's required reading are presented as non-clickable text in the course lecture video. There is no list of URLs for the reading available which I could find, and to take this course students are required to copy dozens of long, cumbersome web addresses from the video."
19051,"Amazing course, very enjoyable and useful! Rank is a great teacher!! :)"
19052,"His is an excellent course that captures many different text mining technique. It requires some path knowledge in numerical analysis and probability in order to understand the concepts.I gave 4 star rating due to 2 problems during the course:1) Back of examples along the formula and principles. There are some, but many concepts could be adopted much faster if examples were introduced right along with them.2) The optional programming exercises are easy to complete, but the environment is very confusing to set it up."
19053,amazing experience with the instructor enjoyed every moment of learning
19054,"The BEST lecture ever.Professor Andrew G magically makes everything so easy.The assignment are not that challenging but appropriate for all students who didn't even took any of computer science class..overall, again, the best !"
19055,His is one of the best online courses out there and not just about Machine Learning. The course was very well organized and the teaching staff was very helpful in resolving whatever issues cropped up. I would suggest you to provide additional reading/ references at the end of the course in 'Losing remarks'. Thank you Cross. Emily and Parlor for the wonderful course. Deep up the good work! I am looking forward to the next one.
19056,A different approach to online learning. Requires concrete proof of feedback that reflect interaction and contemplation of the learner with the content given. Excellent course.
19057,Good Introduction!
19058,"Some of the lectures are missing and some of the questions/answers in the quit are not the same as given in the lecture. Overall, I'm satisfied, though would prefer lectures to be no longer than min per one video"
19059,"Professor G is an excellent teacher. Of you put the work in, you'll leave this course with a ton of confidence in you of knowledge and capabilities."
19060,The course is awesome. I've learnt a lot from it and I understand much more the world we all live in.
19061,"Content is actually very good, I can feel the content creator and staffs emphasis on real world problems. Projects and Assignment are quite useful, and I can expect to use skill I acquired in my day to day work. However, the most agonizing parts of this course is it requires tremendous of time to do self-study. I spend tons of time on goose search, reading docs and go over other people's post on various forms in order to find the right way(sometimes optical way) to finish the assignment. I understand and accept that self-study is very import to master things nowadays, but I really think gap is too big between what was taught in class and what you need to complete this course, especially for people that has zero data science programming experience like me.I'd rather spend time watching 2 more hours of teaching video per week that can cover more aspects/topics/tips/tricks than go over lots of docs and posts. I won't deny I learned a lot through this course, but I believe my learning curve can be flatten significantly if there is more class materials available. Of the majority of course is spent on cooling, what's the point to take it?"
19062,It's a very good course in order to update the financial culture and also institutions and history involved.
19063,Highly information. Plan to go further into the specialization by taking the third course
19064,Comprehensive knowledge disseminated in the most intelligible & practical manner.
19065,Great course that explain how to program in a very easy way.
19066,MeteorJS is an amazing tool that gives an incredible potential of web development.The course explanations are very well organized and very clear.
19067,"I will give it a 3* review as I really enjoyed and learned a lot in the HTML and CSS part (first 2 weeks), but the cava script is really poorly covered. It is too hard and with no ""translations"" on what the hell is going on. The Duke University team is good and they obviously know what they are doing, but they need to review this course and make it more simpler... :)"
19068,"very nice introduction to classes, subclasses and interface. The final project took me a serious effort but i think this is all about commitment. i got tucked for few days but when you find the solution to your problem is a very adjective sensation"
19069,Effective Problem-Solving and Decision-MakingCongratulations on the platformCongratulations on the administrative order of the courseCongratulations on the Success of the Course
19070,Awesome course
19071,It is perfect for beginners.
19072,Excellent course! It helped me to be happy again!!P.S. I'd like to help translate this course to spanish so more people can benefit from it!
19073,"great course! awesome,i have learned many of the things from this course would like to thanks dr. chuck tell about these studies"
19074,Fascinating course
19075,Should have been a complete course. The course did not give specific tools to conflict resolution rather information about the subject was disseminated
19076,Super cool and interesting!
19077,"Very interesting course material, however, texts are often in such bad English that they are incomprehensible, and the staff does not react in the Discussion section."
19078,"Great content, nice presentation but Coursera webster is slow, especially the submission step is unstable."
19079,of is a bit boring
19080,The course is very well structures and touches a large range of topics. Professor Empty makes some of the lecture material very interesting and has simplifies complex theories and concepts. However the Astropedia textbook needs to be updated with recent events.
19081,"His is the very useful course with the good explanations, teachers, funny examples and video. With this course, the grammar is easy to learn. You will not be bored during the education. You will certainly enjoy it! I like Emily and Take's teaching very much. And my favorite joke is about Johnny Pp. A ha"
19082,"Of you have no prior experience with programming, this is the course for you."
19083,"Very interesting and compelling course, and I liked the questions every few minutes during the lectures as that helps me to retain information.By only complaint is that the lecturer's manner of speaking is very rhythmic and repetition and that makes it kind of hard to lose track of his words."
19084,"excellent course. been only through the first week until now, but I have implements an actual machine learning algorithm."
19085,"His is a great introduction to Israel and Middle Eastern politics. It's not too tough- everything is broken down into very manageable 7 or 8 minute lessons, so it's easy to acquire a general understanding of the factors that led to the formation of Israel. Students looking for an in-depth examination may be disappointed, but if you're curious about this fascinating and very relevant chapter of history, this course will give you a good overview, and leave you hungry to learn more."
19086,good introductory of patron.
19087,"It was an excellent journey on Bootstrap. The instructor, Or Jogesh was really helpful in taking us through the course giving a strong insight into the bootstrap world. His course has given me a confidence in building a responsive webster of ahead. Hoping to enhance the knowledge in the coming courses in the specialization and build a strong career as Web de.Thank You, Air!"
19088,Amazing depth in the curriculum and extremely lucid explanation by professor silver. A pleasure to have enrolled in the course and expanded my knowledge in the world of finance
19089,Great lesson
19090,good course! Vice !
19091,It is very interesting but the data collection and preparations in every example is not clear. please work on it.
19092,I believe this is an excellent course because the fundamentals are explained in great detail. The instructor conveys his knowledge in a very precise way. I highly recommend this course for anyone who has a basic knowledge of web development because the last lectures can get a bit difficult for begginers.
19093,"I learned a lot during this course. It took quite a lot of time and energy to complete it, but I'm glad I did. It is now much easier to follow the text of Richard Lyons' book. Highly recommended."
19094,Very well explained and with excellent examples.
19095,Good introduction to getting data from the web. I've used this course to scrape fantasy football data and analyse it in Expel
19096,His class was really lacking. The content was simply and the assignment overlay simple and rose.
19097,Thank you very much! The best course!
19098,1. well structures 2. easy to grasp 3. compelling examples 4. motivation to make an impact in your developing country

The second amendment is constantly mentioned by the players in the election, so I thought I should learn all about the amendments and how they were written, and in what context. After taking this course my friend from New Work said I should take the american Civic test to see if I could pass. I took the test and after 2 tries I passed with 90%. It made me realize how there are most likely a large majority of American citizens who do not know the constitution at all, and the history in which it was created from. I agree with the professor in that this document changed the world. And as I watch the world news of the day, I am thankful that it was written and that I live in a part of the world that has democracy, flowed as it is, it at least gives some voice to the people. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn and understand American history."

These lessons are the best!"
19145,"Still absolutely awesome program. Only two comments. I understand it's probably necessary, but I didn't like relying on code I didn't understand - I don't like the ""take it on faith"". Other is that I liked the old video approach in which both Or. Chuck and the code were visible simultaneously, rather than alternating between. Otherwise a really important course to make available to everybody. Thanks -"

19179,"I found this course very helpful in making me bethink the way I teach - moving from a lecture mode where I present information to students whilst they force themselves to try and focus or fall asleep to teaching using questions whilst inserting information at helpful points to guide the conversation. I am a homeschooling Sum and a church pastor, and in both those settings I have found this course to be very insightful and transformation in the way I teach and can promote creative thinking and engagement with students."
19180,Excellent!Not so easy for begginers.Very Useful. After this course I can explore many new possibilities.

19194,Good work! Thanks for education
19195,It's a neat course
19196,Very enlightening of a course for those starting their journey as a data scientist or analyst.
19197,Fool course.. covered required basic knowledge in data science
19198,"Good course when you want to get to know some basic mechanical physics. Examples are real world scenario which makes everything much more reliable and exciting.Course has very little path in it so it's easier to follow for beginners. But if you want some path exercises and examples then you need to find some other course/book to help you.I think Louis hasn't visited the page for a while, because he hasn't given any comments in discussion forum for a while. There's some activity in the forum by community, but not the author of the course."
19199,I learned so much about the welfare philosophies that are practiced across the globe! I look forward to future courses with this wonderful institution.
19200,Enjoyed the course.The exercised are well-designed. Good way to start MySQL !

19206,Thank you Andrew G for inspiring a Petroleum Engineer towards data science. I division huge potential for me in the near future.
19207,easy to understand !! and really useful
19208,Andrew G is really cool !!!!
19209,very useful
19210,Accessible for earners with close to zero background.
19211,good course
19212,Great Course! I really enjoyed it .
19213,Thank Coursera very much for providing such a good course. Also thank for the teacher from Illinois.
19214,Thank you so much for your expertise
19215,"I'm several months into this specialization. It seems to practice little of what it reaches in its design and pedagogy. I've paused repeatedly because I find the whole experience needlessly clung and frustration, and I rarely feel like I've learned much at the end of the assignment. I often wonder if anyone on the UCSD/Coursera side ever actually tries to complete the assignment. The quit is missing key links and the questions read as if they were written by someone who's first language is not English. Pretty floppy effort."
19216,"Very good course, though a bit less challenging than I have expected. A true tapping of the previous courses."
19217,Amazing! Excellent delivery of content and virtuosic playing at the same time
19218,"Great introduction, really information and manageable as a beginner course."
19219,"By first completed course, Or Chuck is fantastic education, this course is very well structures"
19220,Very helpful for knowing all the principles of economics.
19221,I would give 5 stars if the pace was not so fast... week 5 especially have large amount of information to process compressed in short period of time.
19222,"A very information and easily understandable course! I always fancied path, but never really got deep into it, so some of the primitive discussed here were new to me, but even so I was able to easily understand them thanks to Prof. At! And of course it was super exciting to find out in which way are modern secure connections secure. 10/10 would pass again."
19223,Must the quality of a content and approach!
19224,It is helpful.
19225,Interesting lectures and crystal clear concepts - thanks to Professor Rindfleisch.
19226,The video were a bit confusing and gave me the impression that it was a patchwork from old lectures.
19227,It's good
19228,The best.
19229,One of the best courses I have ever encountered in Coursera. It is really a developmental science.
19230,It's cool. It help me to enjoy listening other lecture.
19231,I really loved this course. It was very diversified with different sources and medium. The course reaches not only the basis and the current situation but also goes beyond and introduces new technologies that will have profound impact on digital marketing.
19232,"Lots of learning and fun. Although quite specific, not tedious at all."
19233,It's awesome. I am learning a lot. Thank you
19234,"Helps understand all basis for estimating the cost of a project, I wish it went into a little more depth."
19235,I like this course very much.
19236,"The contents of the course are great and prof. Empty is a great communication. The course is easy to follow, the final chapters on salaries and cosmology are a bit more difficult but that is due to the nature of the subject and I applaud that the prof does not ""dumb it down"" or brushes over such difficult and speculative subjects. I minor nuisance for me were the frequent songs and funny video interspersed in the course content. It would have been better if they were separate from the main video or otherwise could be easily skipped by people who don't have a lot of time. overall a great course!"
19237,I followed this course as part of Professional of package. It really helped me making the right career choice. I extremely recommend this course to everyone.
19238,"The course provides a case. He have to identify the problem. I appreciated the fact that how I define a problem decides on how I propose to address it. A different definition leads to altogether different steps! The course also provides a good temple and sufficient guideline to help us develop a strategy to address the problem we have defined. Finally , we have to think about how we can test if our strategy is viable. He are also guided to think about the changes that might be necessary in our organization in terms of structure, KPIs, skill etc. Given the nature of this capstone project one cannot expect it to be too specific and have a heavy application of analysis. That it does is provide you with a good idea of how to put all that you have learned in each of the specializations in a comprehensive manner, and that how these ideas fit together to create a big picture. Of you are looking at complex number crunching excerices then you will not find it here. Of you are looking for excerices that will make you think and think and think then you will be quite satisfied. I am!"
19239,Practical and immediately applicable - language and activities to start your positive classroom. Participants are dedicated and the assignment offer insightful opportunities to explore concepts and create content for your classroom.
19240,"All the courses in this specialization are great, but compared to the other 3 i did until now, this one seemed a bit short on material. Especially week 1, and somewhat week 6 was without good material. Weeks 2, 3 and 4 were great. I got lost somewhere in week 5 on collapsed Limbs smiling.Still: very much recommend this course, it provides a good introduction to Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, Russian Pictures and LDA. The prof. Box!!"
19241,I really enjoyed the course. Thanks Or. Valley and Or. Sejnowski for presenting us with a lot of great insight into how we learn and the pitfalls we may encounter.
19242,"His class assumes intermediate-advanced experience coming in Python, so if you are new, you are likely to struggle a lot. The SQL part, however, was taught from a base-level understanding of almost 0 and is much easier for a beginner."
19243,"His was the most intense and enjoyable courses I've ever taken. Professor Almeida is simply brilliant. He's the type of academic that marries theory with the real world. He's also a first class academic with some great publications. The course provides a great mixture of analysis and then true-to life case work on companies and deals. He prepared to work But know that you'll come out of this class with a completely solid knowledge of corporate finance. You can't sit back in the class. He challenges you to work and practice and ask questions. I don't know if I've ever learned as much from one class as I did in this one. One thing, usually I speed up my video lectures but I had to slow down my video needs with Prof. A.! His is the best business class I've ever had."
19244,"His is definitely a great class to help you understand the principles to web design in HTML, CSS, of, and understanding how to host your web in the right way. I really enjoyed working on the capstone project with the students in class. The people online are helpful on reaching out to your questions and being able to give you some advice of how to improve your designs.I would definitely recommend anyone who is interested in a computer programming or web design career to take this class. It is a great way to help you get more knowledge to the web design world. Hope this survey helps."
19245,"His course is most amazing in the specialization, I've learned a lot of very interesting and practical things — seems like knowledge is built up very well in the specialization and you end up truly enlighten. Thanks a lot to all people involved in it's creation, and to Maxim personally!"
19246,"Excellent, really helpful! A must for every starting out the student!"
19247,Great explanations and exercises.
19248,"Very useful , helped me in my learning for real"
19249,"The class started with great instruction and was easy to follow. Coming into week 4, the class sped up really quick and became a lot more difficult to manage."
19250,Not easy for new earners
19251,"Clear, concise and efficiently overview of Trophic Design."
19252,Excellent course because it is so simply & clearly presented by Prof A.. who brings his enthusiasm across well in the video.. highly recommend
19253,Good content but would have preferred if it was more interactive. There is no way to discuss in detail and debate over a topic. I still have many questions unanswered and forum is very inactive. Wish there was a thread for each topic where people could just discuss their perspective. Overall good content but lack of interaction makes it incomplete in my opinion.
19254,nice course with good information and helpful practice
19255,"Fantastic course - great content, very information, and engaging presentations"
19256,"It was intense and at the same time efficient online course. Sides were clear and short enough to catch attention. Interviews and examples were impressive!I really liked this course from Bocconi University, and I highly recommend everyone who wants to know about food & beverage management as a beginner."
19257,Excellent introductory course!
19258,"His course was wonderfully constructed. It took simple, but relevant concepts and made them come alive with humor grounded in realism."
19259,Very good content and best described
19260,"His was a really good course. The information was useful and down to earth and the Tutor was friendly with her presentation. I recommend this course to lots of people, friends and colleagues."
19261,"I am very happy to have finished this course. I learned a lot from him. I did not like Python. I thought it was not interesting to learn this language, but I was wrong. Today I strongly recommend learning more this language because it can help you a lot with your simple way of solving things. Thanks to all of you who have made this course possible."
19262,Great way to introduce Calculus to everyone!
19263,I enjoyed how this class was presented. I think it would have beneficial to have more examples of Run Charts vs Control Charts to high light why each one was useful in multiple ways. Over all the course was useful for me and I will apply the knowledge I learned.
19264,"It's one of the most biggest experiences for everyone, and everyone who wants to be part of the sustainability, who wish and want a better world seen since the green economy"
19265,"Although it is supposed to be a basic course, it deals with fundamental topics that everyone should be aware during the writing process. It helped me a lot, mainly in what concerns with revising the work and making drafts"
19266,"Great course, it was exactly what I was missing to help me progress in my work analyzing genetic data. By studying the content, I gained in a short amount of time the new skill I needed to analyze genetic data. The course is very rich, and I enjoyed it very much. It is very visible that the professor is an expert in this field !"
19267,His course is really nice! Normal courses are superficial with basic knowledge. I really like the way of researches introducing their area and talking about the recent related publications. It is a proper course for college or post-graduate student in this area! Thank you for making so much effort!
19268,Brian is a great instructor. His course was a pleasure.
19269,"Very well structures course, really good for the beginning!"
19270,It went quite well.Learn't a lot of stuff.Feeling great.
19271,"Very good course. However, you need to do a lot of reading. The video are simply introduction to the topics. The course has a lot of reading. The reading are great resources, however, some of them are very very long. I wish the video had more of a lecture component. The final was difficult as you had no idea what would and what would not be on it. Great information, in-depth course, but it could have more video/lecture resources. It could also have more information concerning the information on the final exam."
19272,"Very interesting course, it made me look at some situations from different point of view"
19273,Its very trend and information course. Thanks Coursera for giving mortification from dream university.
19274,Thank you for this overview of the history of the Middle-Last. It makes the current situation there clearer
19275,"After taking a previous course on Angular and reading and trying things, clot was made clear by this instructor slow approach of explaining how things work besides just what they do. Now I feel capable of developing full and large Angular applications."
19276,"His introductory course is perfect. It gives you time to think (you don't have to spend too much time in order to understand the material/concepts) and it is self-sufficient. I would suggest to set the playback rate at 1.25 since the teacher talks really slow. In addition, I would like to see the teacher talking like a human being instead of reading his notes in a black background but this is not super important for me. All in all, I totally recommend it!"
19277,"His course was not nearly as valuable to me as the first course in the series. It breeze through a bunch of different plot types without explaining in enough detail what they would be used for or when you should choose to use them. It the same time, it also didn't provide enough clear examples of how to do basic things in matplotlib, which seems to me to be a very non-intuition thing with poor documentation. I found the first assignment to be very difficult."
19278,"A very good introduction to the various aspects of machine learning, very well taught, with well designed programming exercises."
19279,Very interesting course. Help me increase my vocabulary and my power of argumentative.
19280,A lot of concepts helpful for learning
19281,I enjoyed going through this course. The material was fascinating and the instructor provided great detail regarding the data and research.
19282,Amazing Course! I was in doubt if I was taking the right path in doing a master degree in machine learning and after this course I'm definitely sure! Thank you Andrew G!
19283,"Great course, I had a lot of fun"
19284,"Excellent for beginner.I literally didn't know anything about R, and was not familiar with programming.His course gave me a step for advanced data programming."
19285,Awesome on line course.
19286,"I really like the concise and information way in which this course is organized. Thank you for developing relevant, cutting-edge content and delivering it the wide world audience! I think you really contribute to the better world."
19287,Good course
19288,Subjects are not covered in depth but it's a comprehensive overview. Looking forward to the next courses in the specialization.
19289,"In general very good, but some concepts are rushed over due to the short length of the course."
19290,"Not only is the course material valuable, the weekly students' newsletter from the professor provides suggested additional materials so you can continue learning this long after you finish the official class."
19291,thank you so much MAYA i've learned clot
19292,I love the way this professor talk about events. I learned so much.
19293,I'm about half way through this course. It's a great accompaniment to the Health Informatics on FHIR (Georgia Lech). Its well presented and give a huge amount of additional reading to support the learning in each module. For me it has 'normalized' my on the job experience gained in the past few years.
19294,"Very well explained concepts, a must for every student of crept world"
19295,Interesting theories to help put into order what seems to be common sense! There are practical tips.
19296,"His course gives introduction of plenty of earthworks from MoMA, but it will be more interesting if it shows more details and explanations about the network itself or the background of the time and the society."
19297,"Amazing!Very interesting and challenge, thanks to the supporting forum, I can't complete all the coming without your help.After this course, I gain strong understanding of the algorithm and know how to apply them straight to project.Of you are a bigger to of, look no further, this is the perfect course for you!Additionally, it is really unfordable! Cheaper than a book!"
19298,The course materials and lectures are excellent
19299,Great course! HAHA!
19300,It's an awesome course
19301,Very information and hands on course. Perfect for an introductory lessons to HTML5. Instructor is also very clear with her messages and lectures.
19302,It's been awesome so far!!! great work and material. Good way to teach too.Thanks a million
19303,His is the best introductory material on Machine Learning available for free on the www. Thanks so much for this.
19304,"Pretty decent class. Especially for those who is just beginning to learn Python. The only issue I had with this course is the on-line patron compilers, which sometimes would erroneously interpret pacing and would random throw errors. Retyping and reconciling your code would solve the problem, but this is very annoying."
19305,Great course
19306,The perfect pace for students new to statistical programming.
19307,"Pretty good class; good information. The classmates are engaged and have good feedback to give.I'm frustrated at the lack of instructor (or even staff presence) until at least week 3, when finally a staff member answered *one* of the many student questions that have been piling up.Students are a great resource for critiquing work, but we can't help each other with technical questions, or with assignment clarification. To there *definitely* needs to be staff on hand for that."
19308,"His class can be an introduction to people who are beginners of this field. To me, it gives me some basic concepts of machine learning, and a better understanding of how it works. Andrew is an attractive person who can encourage you to be fond of this course. For the public with different background , the mathematics of this course has to be easy, but the actual situation is that you should be good at calculus，statistics，linear algebra，convex optimization and so on, although most of them I have touched when I was a frenchman. if you want to go deeper into it. There is still a long way to go!! In summary, I love Andrew, I love this course, and I love of"
19309,"Great! His is a great course to learn the idea of machine learning even I am not a computer science and data science student. It provides a chance for us to study different type of machine learning algorithm. The assignment also gives you a chance to practice these algorithms on some application example. Of this course can provide more deeply mathematics algorithm or guideline for future study on learning algorithm, it will be a perfect course!"
19310,Excellent course! I've just finished it in this week and I'm very happy for it. Was a good experience. I'll continue to study programming because I think it so exciting.
19311,The visualization can give you a general overview of data visualization. It opens an door for the data processing.
19312,"Good course, with general and not over-detailed explanations of all the relevant topics in data Science. A good, general overview definitely worth working on."
19313,I thought it was a great course with real world experiences taught by professional knowledgeable and experienced individuals.
19314,It is quite an interesting entry-level class.
19315,"His was a fun course. Information is presented in digestive, bite sized pieces. The peer review process works fast and well--I was surprised how perceptible the critique of my photo were."
19316,"Thorough course, full of interesting material to expand knowledge on the topic. Prof. Wicker's video are extremely well done, with examples, and a good line of explanations that usually start far from the issues to get back to the issue and connect de dots."
19317,"Excellent! I'm amazed at how much I learned. Of there's is an Academy award for online courses, this would win the ""best picture"" award (and I wish there is to help highlight well-developed courses). Lectures, tutorials, resources were great, clear and most importantly, effective in communicating concepts, algorithms and developing the necessary programming skill (and I'm saying this after trying many others and giving up mid way). I have no doubt that this course will continue to stay relevant and evolve as this field as well as online delivery format progresses. I'm very very thankful for having access to such wonderful training material, made possible by founders of course, which I understand to include Prof Andrew G. I'm also very inspired by how course democratizes access to courses from top universities."
19318,Thank you Prof. Andrew G.
19319,"Awesome Lecturer,Amazing class!!!"
19320,The course is really clear and I absolutely recommend it if you are interested in machine learning.
19321,"I really enjoyed this course a lot. However i am not familiar with Path, i could pass this course with 92.8% and for me this high grade.Thanks a lot for Tokyo University and Prof.Maruyama who exerted a great effort in this course , and Also i anna thank Coursera Team too, because made this course available to students who live in arid countries.Shed Same Abdelnaeem."
19322,"Very worth learning.Introduced the basic concepts of project management in system, benefit a lot from this course."
19323,"The exercises are good, and the material is clear. I really like that the students have to review each other's work. I found the feedback helpful, and I found reading other people's work helpful too. I really would like a teacher to grade me as well though. There were a couple of times that I wasn't certain that I fully understood what I was doing, so to have me grade someone else left me feeling guided and unqualified to assign a grade. I believe I got feedback saying just that at least once."
19324,"Great instructor, video and activities. The projects are really enjoyable to knoll."
19325,Love this course
19326,Longer than it should be
19327,Very Informative & Elaborate
19328,i have learnt a lot from this course. Great Lectures
19329,Excellent course. I have started to use the pomodoro
19330,A very interesting course that offers specific tools to learn faster and efficiently. Very clear vocabulary for non-english speakers!
19331,I love this course!
19332,It is a very interesting subject and the lectures are very understandable and not boring at all!
19333,"I took this class for general knowledge. Is a Teacher Naturalists for years, I wanted the additional education and perspective on new topics (AIDS, of in Russia, new findings etc). ""Crushing up"" via a class like this was perfect."
19334,The information was very helpful. I would have benefited from quit explanations I kept getting the same two questions wrong on quit 2.
19335,West Programming Lecture EVER!!!!
19336,Its an excellent course and a must do for everyone in UNICEF
19337,Great course. I learned things that I didn't think were possible.
19338,Great and FUN!
19339,Amazing Course! Vice instructor!
19340,Really helpful and inspiring course!
19341,"very helpful. Thanks, Yeah and team :)"
19342,The course is very well structures and provides useful practice assignment.
19343,THE COURSE of GOOD.
19344,His course was great because history has always fascinate me and this helped fuel my love of history.
19345,I think this is the best Introductory course on Special relatively. I strongly recommend beginners to go through.
19346,I honestly thought this course was all over the place and too general. It also seemed to be full of self - congratulations about what UPENN has accomplished with its research. I wanted more depth in a more target approach to improving my life.
19347,Excellent gripping delivery of what otherwise could be simply a bunch of dull facts.
19348,A really good course that shows you solutions you can consider when you don't know how to learn something.
19349,Very helpful and encourages us to push boundaries without burnt and stress.
19350,"His course is very interesting with well thought-out content that involves the student very actively from the first lesson. The assignment are challenging but also very exciting. I consider is a unique innovation in MOOC courses. The professor give excellent information interspersed with interesting case studies. Unfortunately, there was no interaction in my operation of the course, or any apparent involvement whatsoever, from any of's or senators. All questions remained unanswered (except by other students), and frustrated calls for help and advice were ignored. The majority of the course's mark (60%) is determined by fellow students using a public which leaves little true 'wriggle room' between pass and fail marks. The mystery cases on which we worked during the course were never 'resolved' or explained in any way, which would have been nice after the effort that went into them. I would recommend the content of the course 'for fun' but if anyone is looking for an accurate assessment of material learned, try another course."
19351,Course was in some way inspiration. I've found a few ideas from the course revealing (eg. is the brain storming effective?) . I can honestly recommend this course for people who want to develop business skill on Leading Beams.
19352,West of Coursera!
19353,Good for beginners. To all assignment even if its optional.
19354,I found the course is detailed and explained nicely to start as a beginner. The quit helps to understand and learned the subject matter properly.
19355,"It was indeed a very well designed course that not only gave a great overview of various machine learning technique, but also gave hands-on experience in implementing those technique. Moved Dato. GraphLab Create is awesome."
19356,very useful
19357,I really enjoyed the content presented!!!
19358,Very well structures and great learning. By special thanks to Prof Andrew and the entire team; His will help me shape up remaining years of of professional life for sure.
19359,"Enjoyable course with engaging presentation. I really enjoyed the assignment which encouraged me to actually try out the concepts, without getting too hung up on it being perfect. I also appreciated the assignment examples that were provided - it helped give me a guide as to how detailed or not I should be each week, and gave me"
19360,"I like this course, it covers a wide range of topics."
19361,"His is by far the best course for people to get knowledge of machine learning in practice, especially for people who are working full day and are not actual students.That I really missed here, is some other topics:1. Bayessian network.2. Markovian decision processes and Markovian hidden models.3. Deep learning, of course.I guess you cannot really cover all that in one course, but I would gladly see the sequel for this course describing those topics."
19362,One of the most impressive courses I ever had. Or. G assumed that every student was the beginner and explained those complex theory and method in plain words. Strongly recommended this course and I will surely broadcast among my friends and colleagues.
19363,"Finally a perfect learning course for AngularJS. Yakov is one of the best teachers. Plus, you will love colonies!"
19364,"Really well done, it does't teach you just the language but let you understand how it works in the computer.but is for real beginners, useful the student's notes"
19365,"The course is nice, lectures is fine.But assignment is a bullshit. The instructions are uncertain, with types. There is random number used, and you have to do magic with your algorithm in order to match expected output. I strongly dislike it."
19366,West for Engineers who wants to know about overview of tags used and build a simple webpage.
19367,Great course.
19368,Excellent course to understand the basic of data science.
19369,Very information course.
19370,I found this program extremely useful to understand the concepts of Fig Data. I can now get into any conversation and do not feel li
19371,Really Didn't like the course.
19372,I found all the topics of this course important. Not only for my professional career but also for everyone who is involved with data and science in general.
19373,Love the way this course is taught
19374,You get to learn from the basis and taught really well. Thank you :)
19375,Simply amazing. Well thought-out and fun too. A good starting point for anyone looking to get into patron
19376,"With my background I found this part of the course rather slow, but I can see why it's necessary for people with less of a software background."
19377,"First two weeks of the course were ok, but after that it became something like JavaScript cap-trap, tormented to playing with images. I wanted to know how to make web-pages, I didn't get that information from this course."
19378,"The lectures are very well-organized. The topics are also cover in this field. However, the lectures are very dry and boring. The main professor were reading the script on the monitor. From my perspective, with his knowledge in this field as being described on his personal web site, he should be able to talk comfortably by looking at the topic on the slide then discuss about it in detail. I would suggest to change the environment to be at the wide open space, like coffee shop, to make this course more attractive. I'm sorry, it is not what I expected."
19379,"The course was more about CSR and philanthropy of business towards society which was not what I expected as the course topic as very vague. Having done an MBA in business I as expecting more in-depth teaching on strategics of various business and how their creation of value to slaveholders.The course is short and very appropriate for beginners but not in-depth knowledge, however it still does create valid points on business role towards society at large.Lastly I did like that all course material for all weeks were opened and thus one could progress through the course faster"
19380,In interesting and easy-to-understand course. Gives a great overview on negotiations and some legal stuff concerning legislation.
19381,"Obviously, the specific of an ancient Chinese opera are not for everyone, but if you are into China and/or Classical Music, there is much to learn here. Any of the lectures are given by (former) performer which guide you through a scene or area, explaining as they go along. I for one enjoyed the insight into this unique way of storytelling."
19382,"His has been a great learning experience for me, I developed an appropriate routine was the exercise of a conscious leadership, where I have raised awareness of the connection with people to establish meaningful communication . Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity , thank you ."
19383,"Though Andrew G screws mathematical detail in the beginning, I am finding that this survey style course was a really nice introduction to how people approach problems in of and practically use of."
19384,In amazing course that was just what I was looking for as a violins who is interested in learning to teach. By kiss are working through the curriculum now and we are all having a great time!
19385,great introductory course
19386,"I loved this course!! It is very useful, this course has helped me and my family eat wealthier!!"
19387,"Very well-designed course with comprehensive information for each week. The content of this course is superb, but as a non-native English speaker, sometimes I find it difficult to catch up with the long sentences in the video and have to go back to the transcribe."
19388,"Very interesting, providing knowledge, developing skilled, mildest and experiences,Chris!Thank You"
19389,"Informative. Although, it a week course on architecture of Park (especially YARN mode), explaining Park Sobs, Stages & Asks would be nice addition. Thank you for sharing knowledge and a wonderful learning experience!"
19390,Good but needs more assistance with the students.
19391,"His course material and the way of teaching of guide was awesome. I have learnt a lot from this course. I was newcomer for image and video processing, knowing not much. But finally learnt a lot , Now I am very happy and relaxed"
19392,"It is a course at first somewhat complex, but then the ideas of great thinkers and participants of social action are unfolding through culture and music. The course is very complete and the way the teacher reaches is very wise. Very practical and useful for our social exercises. Thank you."
19393,In absolutely wonderful course! I learned a lot about advanced essay writing. I think it is a must-take course for those who are interested in writing academic and research essays!
19394,"I didn't pay for the certificate, and I just watched the video and took the quires without mortification. I wanted to get exposure to project management. The class was well taught, gave a lot of information in short video segments. Great outside examples to illustrate the concepts covered. Great value and awesome for the Garden to provide this class (especially since it was free!)."
19395,Great!
19396,Excellent traumatic take on Design Thinking - a fairly complex subject that was made as easy to understand. Really enjoyed Prof Liedtka - am ready for a more advanced course on this very interesting subject - thank you so much
19397,A great course to establish a fundamental understanding of positive nutrition as well as integral steps that can be taken and implements everyday to start a meanginfu
19398,Vice!! I can write a web application now!
19399,"His is a great course and also flexible to needs of students. Of you get behind, the course is built to help you get back on track. I find this extremely helpful with a busy and irregular schedule."
19400,Highly recommended. Perfect Course..
19401,"Between the book plugs,and the seemingly partisan descriptions of later Presidents,the course goes from a actual overview,to a wandering book pitch"
19402,"It was a wonderful experience to learn how to learn, thank you professor Barbara for this fascinating trip!"
19403,"His is not a basic expel training. The title is appropriately set as ""Mastering"" Data Analysis in Expel..."
19404,Mandatory
19405,I am new to of and this course explains so many things to get started. I still have more than half the course to go through still and already so much delighted to have taken this course!
19406,Good combination of theory concept and practical exercises.
19407,I enjoyed this course thoroughly! I love how playful the professors are in the video. Takes learning fun!
19408,Thank you son much!!!!I really like the course.It help me in my job =)
19409,best course ever i could even teach this to anyone else and david sister is my favourite teacher and monk long university of since and technology in my favourite university and i am just 10
19410,Good Course
19411,Well worth the time. It has helped me improve my confidence in learning.
19412,"good pace, perfect trading mechanism, interesting"
19413,Very elementary coursework. Quizzes were too simple while I expected some challenging questions that'll make you think. Please improve the assignment quality.
19414,His course is awesome
19415,His course has some great quit questions. I'd recommend it to people just for them.
19416,Good Course. To the point and clean lectures.
19417,"The course is very good, language very clear, concepts explained very well. Congratulations to the team from Amsterdam University!"
19418,very useful one. Good starting point for beginners.
19419,Good course!
19420,Need to explain more topics
19421,Great course. Thank you!
19422,"The final module is vague , but the course is nice as a whole"
19423,A great course. I'm in week 2 and already learned so much!!! A total new way to approach the topic of learning!!!
19424,"I have completed 2 MOOCs till but am very happy with the new curriculum,dividing the course into small nodules.I am showing interest when am watching video,clear explanation and fully satisfied with this course.Thank you"
19425,It has opened a wider view about teaching that is ahead of us we have to follow.
19426,"Great content but dome speakers really need to be more involved... Some video are perfect if you want to sleep...Also there was some mistakes in the programming assignment (more or less fixed now) and maybe a bit more details or example code would help. It was hard to make the assignment without extra help and many students had difficulties finding what to do, hopefully the forum was a real life saving tool.The MATLAB introduction is just ridiculous: you'll need six more knowledge of it to do the assignment. it's like taking your first driving lesson on Monday and do Indianapolis 500 on Tuesday...For someone like me that was not very familiar with this tool, I spend 90% of the time cooling ""matas doing this or that"" to find example code and making the code work instead of working on the algorithm itself.The tutoring in the Aerial Robotics is more complete."
19427,"Simplicity, visual & analogies...I think it everyone should take this course. Learning how to learn should be a foundation subject taught in every school. It's a really awesome course. It provides some really simple and effective technique to master the learning process.P.S. Barbara Valley is so cool, she's one of my idol﻿."
19428,I think it is a good class overall but the pace is fast and the resources that can help you is lacking. His will be good for someone who already kind of understands bioconductor.
19429,i want to study more about cancer and this course give me that chance
19430,His is a pretty good course for machine learning area
19431,Not enough depth. But another way not a of course.
19432,Thank You for the course.
19433,"Great course, very information!"
19434,"I've enjoyed this course so much! I nearly quit it before properly starting, because the first video seemed very uninteresting. Also, the material covered seemed very basic and common sense. And I guess a lot of it is, but to discuss these basic concepts, and experiment with them is very valuable. It also made me very excited about designing. In this course, it's up to the student to decide how much they want to put into the course, and therefore how much they will get out of it. Lots of the assignment are optional. However, all (but one) exercise really helped me explore the concepts explained.It's a clear course. It's a very basic course. Met ready to get hands on."
19435,"His is a very basic course, not at all college level."
19436,Very nice way of teaching such a difficult subject. I like both the instructor. Assignment are bit easy though and must have been on open source software.
19437,It made aware of some of my task planning issues.
19438,"Well planned and with exciting activities, the capstone was a great final step for the course!"
19439,Great courses and great instructions!
19440,Very good course to understanding the glances of Data science and various tools used.
19441,"Very engaging lecturer. I would have preferred the course to be a little more challenging, with perhaps a final exam or some extra reading. Nevertheless, highly recommended."
19442,"Great course! Coursera will change the world, make the education more flat to everybody in the world who are eager to knowledge."
19443,Great material and teaching style. Thank you for making this course available!
19444,Is a beginner student. I enjoyed a good course that it gave me the tools to continue to seek methods to learn JavaScript and everything related to web design.
19445,Great experience! A lot of knowledge
19446,His is a great course for every employee!!!
19447,Great for enhancing your understanding of how non-profits are governed. I'd highly recommend this course for anyone involved with a non-profit organization.
19448,"Electric professor! Great course, without doubts."
19449,most interesting classes
19450,"strong 5 stars. There are some minor issues and concerns, BUT even the sun has spots. Two great things about this course. First, it's very structures overview of how organizations are designed and managed, of policies, culture, decision making, also it reiterated Northcraft's courses pretty well. Second, is brilliant reading assignment. I would never found and read those articles. They've been of useful. I definitely recommend this course, although I was a bit skeptically about the first part."
19451,Well organized and very useful course with great teacher :) Thanks a lot!!
19452,Thanks for the course. It's really helpful.
19453,"i see course must be require for every engineer ,that because the new technology and last update of data"
19454,thanks to course i learned how to become a real teacher.
19455,"good instructor and content , i enjoyed it"
19456,"Amazing Course , Covered everything that an Entry level financial analyst is looking for"
19457,Moved the course! Very information! By fiance and I did it together and he enjoyed it as well! Wish there were more weeks!!
19458,"Quite clear, good for introduction"
19459,the lack of assisted practices made it harder to digest the contents and methodologies.strongly suggest to develop some practice problems with explanations.
19460,I loved to hear from the writers their own experience when writing a novel. To lighting!
19461,"It was a really nice course for a beginner in Python like me. The pace could have been better specially or people with prior programming experience Anyway, it was fun learning Python. The instructor was awesome."
19462,a good course to start learner.
19463,"I give four stars rather than five because I felt that the course seemed less well executed than Calculus One by the same author. He set a high bar for himself. Still, I learned a lot and do appreciate it. I felt the practice quires could have been more helpful in the explanation of wrong answers as was the case in Calculus One."
19464,"Liked the whole course, more practical and extensive than other similar courses."
19465,Good course however the test have difficult questions since are open to different points of views or judgement so it is hard to get the right answer.
19466,Great building block from the Programming for Everybody Course! Challenging at times for someone with no programming experience but definitely worthwhile. Thanks Or Chuck
19467,Professors accent very hard to understand. Week 5's lesson should be reviewed as may have no place in class
19468,I love this course
19469,"I really enjoyed the coursework for this class. In particular, I loved how challenging some of the assignment were. However, I do hate that I cannot submit final quit answers without paying for the course. I also did not like how little help there seemed to be offered to some individuals on the forum regarding issues they were facing with their code (specifically with the GeneFinder project).I took three of the courses from Michigan on working with Python and they were completely open to complete without payment (which means you opt not to get a verified certificate). I wish that this course, and the specialization that it is part of, fell into the same category."
19470,"Extremely helpful. It was detailed and at the same time brief, made sure I am able to connect with the content and learn in ways that will be useful in career.Also, the exam and exercises made sure that my concepts are deep rooted into me.Great Course."
19471,"In excellent course, I have learned a considerable amount about Unity."
19472,Great overview of personal financial planning!
19473,"West course,very good study material."
19474,Great course...incisive and insightful.
19475,I believe this introductory course would be better if it tresses more on the Agile Manifesto Part
19476,"His was a fantastically glanced, and challenging course. But of all of the MOOCs I've done so far, this has really changed the way I see events around me and has led me to look for patterns in things I've never considered before."
19477,all the information learned from this course are hard to be forgotten cause they all are advises for us to get better memory..
19478,There was way more interesting mathematics to linear repression than I ever imagined. I thought this was going to be a boring review of linear algebra and quadratus polynomials. I have never been so happy to be wrong!
19479,Enjoyed the way it was taught. Been to progressing
19480,Easy to follow. Very clear plots. The course content is very flexible. Both good for beginners to understand and give extra space for the proficient to improve skill.
19481,Buds to professors for the great job done.
19482,"Excellent course. Difficult at the start, especially if you have not looked at path symbols and statistics formula in a while, but worth pushing through. I tend not to move on until I completely understand something but with this course it was best for me to accept some of the formula as truth and move on. Eventually I started seeing the light, and towards the end of the course I got what was going on in the earlier lectures."
19483,Vice but basic course.
19484,"Well-organized, interesting, and information course. I have already recommended it to family, friends, and co-workers. Definitely a game-changes."
19485,"The courses are easy to understand, however, they are poorly designed to work on an had. Also, page references for electronic books are useless. It is sometimes difficult to find the reading material in a particular book because the electronic version does not show pages."
19486,"Great lectures, great playing, excellent and enjoyable course. Thank you, Or. Miss and Curtis Institu"
19487,Professor was awesome and taught great I learnt clot
19488,"Very information course. It helped me to get a systematic view on SLE theories. Met I wish the course was a bit longer and less dense, for the lack of a better word. Too much information was squeezed into very short nodules."
19489,"From my perspective, the individual courses that made up the ""Capstone"" (people, customer, accounting, and operations analysis) were both education and interactive. These individual courses contained data focused problems and gave a general overview of the specific field.However, the final ""Capstone"" project was entirely disappointing and something I even plan to complain to Coursera about. After having a two month delay, the course not only lacked any direction, but seemed to be put together last minute without any real thought or plan. The entire ""Capstone"" was driven by hypothetical, almost all of which did not have any relevance to the past four courses. In educated individual could easily complete this ""Capstone"", without any knowledge whatsoever from the previous four courses. The ""Capstone"" provided a few articles and video related to the issue (Yahoo D Blocked) to help us solve the problem, but clearly the course heavily lacked content. I was expecting the course to contain hypothetical data for us to interact with and predict how the D blocked problem and our proposed solutions would drive the data of Yahoo's business. However, the course merely was driven by complete hypothetical that only required one to be educated about general business functions. His ""Capstone"" hardly related to the previous four courses, and it is a scar that this course cost $99."
19490,Very useful and information
19491,Fantastic course and offers a lot of great solutions for establishing exceptions with your staff. In addition I liked how the course gave several examples and tools on how to have sometimes challenging conversations with them to also assess their going performance.
19492,I enjoyed the course very much. I learn very much. It inspired me and made me less apprehensive of the gigantic job I have in front of me. To follow the simple rules and questions of the course will lead you on the right path to success of your mission-based business.ThanksKlaus-Michael
19493,"I thank Or. Leisler, and everyone else involved in this course for their excellent work and for enabling me to obtain the knowledge that I have acquired studying this course. Well done."
19494,TOO DIFFICULT
19495,The explanation is really good with practical exercises. Very easily understandable for the beginners.
19496,I thought this course was an exceptional overview of the different aspects of machine learning and a great way of getting your feet wet before diving into deep learning and neutral network. I would recommend this course to those who are new (or relatively new) to machine learning or those who need a good review of the materials.
19497,very useful for me to get to know something about research method. Thanks.
19498,"Excellent. Thoroughly engaging, thoughtfully organized, and insightful. For anyone interested in the historical events leading to the conditions of the with Century, this course is a gateway to that understanding. Highly recommended."
19499,"His course gave me a very clear idea about why big data came out. big data applications, and the dimensions of big data."
19500,Child Nutrition and Looking was a pretty fun and easy course. Is a stay at home mon and experience novice cook since childhood this class was more of a reap of basic cooking for me and a nice reminder of nutrition goals and current standards. I enjoyed it for my introduction to Coursera. Unfortunately this course didn't offer offer a certificate or statement of accomplishment in any form at the time I took it. :(
19501,Some mind-blowing concepts are here in this course that explain the science of learning and why you learn better in certain scenario.
19502,Very good and systematic introduction to basis.
19503,Not as detailed or practical as I hoped for.
19504,interesting course to support previously knoledgement or improve it.
19505,Interesting material
19506,Its nice .But i don't have time for Assignment work .i feel good on temples.
19507,"A very good course that I would recommend to other people that are starting using JavaScript!Thank you,Adrian"
19508,The concepts are clear and well presented. Ruin questions are relevant to the course material. Flexible due dates make it possible to fit this course in a busy professional life.
19509,"Thank you Rebekah and the rest of the team because right now I have a new career. Must this week I started to help a client with a clinic who needs to improve his local SEO because his clinic didn't show up in the local search for the services he provide. Must working for a week and today he is number one in one of the keywords. I'm so proud that I was able to help him. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
19510,His course has high quality instruction a
19511,I have no real words for the depth provided in this course. of of A MUST!
19512,"Excellent course in strategic management, a perfect capstone to apply knowledge."
19513,"In my opinion, His course is really useful for the people that have an extreme interest with astronomy and also the curious people want to explore the massive universe. And i'm one of these people. In addition, I'm really happy when i found out this webster while i was surging my newfeed, Thank to this program, it's really rightful for a lot of questions always be held in my mind but know i have lighted up a lot."
19514,In impressive course worth completing. Of you want to improve your learning skill you should definitely go for this course.
19515,"I'm grateful to the instructor(s). However, when I turned on closed caution to get used to the accent, the of text covered part of the slide information. Overall, this is a good course to take. I'm glad I took it. Also, I was hoping that there's a clear instruction of Louder Quick Start on Sinus."
19516,it was really a nice course i learned a lot from it .
19517,"The course satisfied me in various aspects. It is brief and clear. Thank you for our instructor for nice presentations.Nevertheless, I would expect more about parma and treatment approaches. More about drugs available in the markets and new tends.Psychotherapy applications / demonstrations would be very useful."
19518,"His course is very useful in your daily life , presented by terrible instructor ."
19519,a good course
19520,I am Maria Qavtaradze and I want to say thanks to Mary and to all team who gave me the chance learn a lot and very interesting things ! Thank you all very much !
19521,great course for beginners. Highly recommended.
19522,Good course and visionary
19523,Very complete course and easy to understand
19524,"His course was extremely valuable to me. Theoretical knowledge especially. By two points for possible improvement, most probably subjective, would be:1.The course is too slow-paced. There is a bit too much of an axillary talk, which may distract from the essential knowledge.2.While the course offers some state of the art practical examples, a little more interactive approach would probably immensely increase student involvement and hence help keep attention and distinguish important points.Lastly, at every start of the week, I was asked to do a test quit to masses my knowledge from that week. His is very strange. The test quires should most definitely be offered only in the end of a week, AFTER I have acquired knowledge, and not before."
19525,Course is clearly and included lots of information.I am clinical dietetician so I can confirm that all of information are true.The teacher are prepared and watching her was my pleasure.I am recommend that course.
19526,Very useful class and you'd better read the book with this course to get more from it.
19527,it's really easy to keep up with and looking forward following courses
19528,"Excellent course. Very instructive, and a lot of fun!"
19529,Not too difficult
19530,Great introductory course to Machine Learning. Have me great insight into the field. Good job mister G
19531,"His is a really suitable course for Physical Chemistry lovers and students, which introduces you into the world of Quantum, Thermodinamics and Nineties, with wonderful video plentiful of explanations, and really good proclamation, that encourages students. Congratulations to all the organizing lectures!!"
19532,Good course. The assignment is very good.
19533,Excellent. Went through the introduction video and course material. Great one. Thanks for publishing it .
19534,"His course is a good start in understanding the basis of graphics design, I felt it could go a bit deeper into the materials but its a good beginning :)"
19535,"I enjoyed this course; although, I only participated in the free version."
19536,"Love this course. I took the first two (as one course), learned a lot (and worked really hard, since I started from scratch). But this one brings the coming part to the web and suddenly gives the whole experience a different dimension. Mind-opening. That's why I like it."
19537,Excellent introduction to Python!
19538,"His course is fantastic, the tools presented are very useful for any student in any area. It's really important to know how our brain works in order to have a good performance as a learner."
19539,"Very easy to understanding and practical, especially for the beginners like me. It give me confidence to go further."
19540,cannot be better! Thank you so much!
19541,"Excellent, though slow-paced, very introductory, and closed over some mathematical/theoretical underpinnings"
19542,The best course for beginner developer
19543,Very interesting! I wish there is some animation film to explain the narrative.
19544,"A great course :) , I enjoyed every lecture . Professors are really good and professional. His is my st course course. I wish that all of my future courses would be so good."
19545,Or. Chuck has very detailed explanations for all codes and all senators are very helpful as well. Recommend!
19546,A wonderful course! To useful it is!
19547,very good and interesting module which help me relate to line of work
19548,His course is absolutely helpful in every mean for a person like me who is taking his very first steps in the data visualization world. although it is very difficult for everyone to accessible fully as its not free.
19549,"Excellent course, funny, intelligent and very useful."
19550,It is an interesting course and provides insight into current research
19551,Brilliant!
19552,Very information and to the point. The instructor guides you step by step along the way to Angular proficient. Highly recommended.
19553,i enjoyed the course so much i didn't want it to finish thanks to the doctors for their simple clear illustration their interesting way in giving us the information
19554,"His course gave me a great overview of GIS and in particular ArcGIS.Fig thanks to our instructor Sick Wants, who he was excellent in explaining the conceptsand how the tool works!!I'd happily recommend this course to anyone interested in GIS."
19555,The capstone project was too simple and not sufficiently challenging
19556,The course is useful and essential not only for those studying statistics but machine learning
19557,"One of the most interesting course I took in Coursera. Difficult because I have zero background of neuro-science, and very little of psychology, but this course drove me to look into neuro-science and psychology in more details."
19558,"Fantastic course, would highly recommend. I learnt so much. An't wait till they bring out another course."
19559,Very information and descriptive course. It encourages a person to do self calculations. Lecture and the material available are all very well explained. Would love to take similar courses.
19560,Excellent course. Great structure and thinking. Even if you know the tools of production it will help you to focus on your desired outcome for each track.
19561,Great content for beginners.Especially appreciated given that the topic is not yet well covered by MOOCs.
19562,"The course covers (all) aspects of intercultural communication and offers solid methodology and rich tools-set for corresponding conflict resolution. The course is very well structures, contains plentiful of video and situations to support the material, the professors of the course are very experienced in the matter and are able to transfer and present the knowledge. It was above and beyond what I could have expected. Well done indeed."
19563,I think pointing out loopholes in food industry is a big plus! His is ACTUALLY education people.
19564,Helped me to learn a lot a new things.
19565,"Good into, maybe a bit basic. Would love a more in depth follow up.Thanks for all your hard work."
19566,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.
19567,Must great
19568,"Good focus on ideas vs principles. The focus on relations algebra is a great way to look at data manipulation in general. Unfortunately, relations algebra is explained quite well, but not really applied after that. His could be a great course if it really taught to constantly think in terms of relations algebra.Okay-is explanations of database and hadoop. Not very deep and not always structures, but rather focused on the technology principles instead of the data principles.I think that this specialisation suffers the same problem most data science/mining/analysis courses suffer: it ignores the non-technical starting point: scientific or business relevance. Now does one organise data, get to know completely new data, understand possible value? i.e. how to start a data science project if all there is is unorganized data and the wish to do 'something' with it."
19569,I enjoyed the overview of project management and the detailed explanations that were immediately helpful in my work. Lots of great information! Any things for me to think about over a long time
19570,"Overall this class was a good starting point for basis of finance, but coming from an Ivy League school it could stand a bit more polish and professionalism, especially if Pale University expects people to pay for the class and their accreditation.The instructor has an odd speech manner which takes a little bit of time to get used to, but doesn't retract from the material.The tests are not difficult but the questions are often poorly phrased, such as questions that ask you what a certain term of art is while none of the answer choice are descriptions of the term of art and the correct answer is an application of the term that does not actually answer the call to question.Most of the video are cobbler together except from lectures the professor previously gave. Is such they cut out random, have issues with the sound volume, and often discuss material that was cut out prior to the section or should come later, but never does. Not the biggest problem once you get used to it, because the course is an overview, but it's still kind of annoying and not very professional compared to other courses available.The instructor is clearly very pro-capitalism, which is a mixed bag. In one hand he's very knowledgable and communicates a lot of really good information. In the other hand he's also very clearly based bordering on topic about the benefits of capitalism and crossing over a lot of the down side risks that are inherent in finance. To be clear this criticism is not of the Professor, or to say that down side risk and risk management are not sufficiently discussed, but merely that IMHO the course could benefit from more discussion and material on the negative aspects/ratification of unfettered capitalism, especially given the large amount of time spent discussing the 2008 recession.All that being said, I learned a lot from this course and found it very interesting and information. While I have a prior basis in the material that helped, I learned a lot of new things and still came away with a better understanding of finance and the international financial system. I would recommend anyone who wants to expand or create a knowledge basis in finance and financial institutions take this course."
19571,It was one of the best course I ever had before
19572,"Clear, Pleasant and Useful!"
19573,Thanks for your wonderful Course. Really it's very much helpful for novice researcher .
19574,A very pleasant introduction to Chinese by a competent and passionate teacher!
19575,"Great introduce, really helpful. thank you!"
19576,"To complaints at all, excellent course in every aspect."
19577,Really enjoyed this course. Thank you very much Barbara for making this course. I wished my professors would use more pictures and less sentences on their presentations. ;)
19578,great course
19579,Relevant introduction to get productive with Tableaux quickly. Clear examples with the ability to apply immediately with a temporary student license to Tableaux.
19580,"The quit and assignment are poorly designed. Important issues are overlooked or just briefly discussed in lecture. The assignment focused on matas coming, which only emphasized the coming technique. To not recommend to audience with"
19581,loved all the lectures
19582,Meyer is a great teacher and I look forward to more courses by her if she continues to release them
19583,"Think you Yakov Haiti !!!, it' a very nice course."
19584,Its just the best!
19585,Great class! Comprehensive coverage of material and unapproachable pace.
19586,"Moved the material and the course design - it really works for people who don't have much time but want to understand the main principles of machine learning. I think I've watched every week's video and completed assignment within about 2-4 hours.The only suggestion I would have (and it is a very personal opinion) is to spend less time on illustrating slightly irrelevant aspects of the material, such as showing quite a few Amazon products or going through a full shoe collection. I can see how that can make the course a little more lively but for a person who treasures every minute of their free time, it can be noticeable, especially when it takes a significant fraction of the very well-sized small video. His was a very minor issue but I thought I'd share in case someone else felt the same way.Overall, a huge thank you to Parlor and Emily for a great course!!"
19587,Thank you for 4 great courses!
19588,Work!!
19589,"To far, exactly what I hoped the course to be! Very excited to follow through with the rest of it."
19590,Vice Cava refreshed.
19591,"Very useful course to users of English from pre-intermediate level and up. The information is presented in interesting and understandable way. Practice exercises are great, you never get bored. The teachers pay attention to really confusing grammar points. For sure will knoll to the other courses from the university."
19592,I enjoyed the course very much wish here was more interaction with staff though
19593,"I'm doing this training for the second time, now as a beta-tested. Articular comments about lecture content, problems, etc. have been put in every lecture.General comments, in short:1) Related to the new platform and of design:_ It is cleaner and simpler than the previous one. I like it, BUT..._ It lacks of some useful features: saving intermediate results in quires before submit them; calendar; limited number of subforums._ The most relevant flaw: there are not downloadable versions of lecture sides. Unacceptable! To way to check most of the links we saw in sides (URLs not visible)._ Description and steps in course project appear ""too packed"" together. I prefer the former design.2) Related to content:_ The course is mainly for preparing students for the rest of data science specialization program. When you said ""toolbox"" you mean the concrete toolbox you will need to do the program. Some people expect to have a general introduction to data science but that is only a half of the content. I think this is clear enough in the presentation but for some reasons there are people in forms who protest the content, so maybe you should insist more in this fact._ I would like to suggest some kind of recorder of material: week 2 is all about installing a running tools and week 3 about key aspects of data analysis. Maybe you can split both types of content between was and was to make was more appealing for not technical tormented students._ It is a source of problems for a good portion of people. See my comments in lectures about how It is explained."
19594,"Very information and good explained course. I have learnt valuable things, thanks to Mrs. Oh! The only thing i would complain about are the uncertain and a bit vague instructions for the assignment. It should be stated clearer f.ex. which theories are meant and a more explicit way of instructing the editorial calendar, f.in. a temple or something like that. Nonetheless a very valuable and good made and lucid experience!"
19595,Thank you for this course.Its great opportunity for make a differentdifferent.Thank you for share yours experience and knowledge.God bless you.
19596,"A great into to Python! Too much video that didn't seem useful to me (the office hours and accompanying video), but the lectures and practice provided a nice balance of learning."
19597,thank for this course it's very good
19598,"Great class, however I felt it was very heavy on statistics and path concepts versus how to use Expel for data analysis. I would've liked to see some strategics on how to analyze large datasets, look for tends, and clean up bad data."
19599,His is an excellent course. Oats off to Prof Into. I had a great time learning new things. Thank you!
19600,nice and easy
19601,"Course gives introductory insight into analysis of of-of power converted, which can be extended to converted of any complexity. Or. Ericksen has explained these concepts well and the assignment further enhance one's understanding of the subject."
19602,Great study
19603,"The course is very useless, there is no meat, only water - there is no substance - only talking around the topic. I am appalled that such research exists, and ashamed for the course"
19604,Very mother should do this course .
19605,His course is very useful and helpful.
19606,and course I take and I enjoyed it just as much as the first!
19607,"The Materials, in fact, are not that difficult compared to other in school of classes I took. However, the greatest thing of this course is that it helps me understand a lot of algorithms which I did not catch well in class. The technical parts of algorithms are not taught in detail, but a way to show and learn. Very good for either an of started or those who are confused about what they learnt in real class."
19608,Professor Andrew G explains the Machine Learning concepts lucid and those helped me a lot to shape my approaches for a given new machine learning problem. I am grateful for Prof. Andrew and Coursera for this wonderful opportunity.
19609,"He always are in a learning process, although we sometimes don't really know how is exactly that process of learning. Thought this course you will be able to learn a lot of useful technique that you can use when learning something. I really recommend it to everyone. To for it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
19610,"Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) is a five star course. Like the name of the course, I could get started with programming with Python a little. Thank you, Prof. Charge"
19611,"descriptions was not enough for me, the BMC concepts could be more elaborated by giving examples and explaining different types of business."
19612,Great course! I'm really enjoy it. Thanks a lot professor of Taylor and staff.
19613,Amazing professors and amazing course
19614,It's a very good lecture.
19615,"Programming assignment sometime ambiguous and hard to follow. A lot of time you have no idea WHICH dataset they are talking about e.g. ""query house"" in the last lesson.Overall it's a great course."
19616,I have really learn a lot through the participation of the course and would like to sincerely thank the people conducting the course to make the course so enriching and also interesting.
19617,"A great course. The lectures are great, and there are many exercises for practicing."
19618,"The course is very challenging, but very interesting. I will probably suggest a bit more of staff support in the last week, specially the final project which is very challenging and demanding. A bit more of orientation will be really good."
19619,Top notch!
19620,"Good course that gives nursery knowledge of some study tools. It's not a breakthrough, must-complete course by any means, and the material it candles isn't overlay complex (given the abstract it uses), but it does quite well and provides meaningful insight for students."
19621,Must very good!
19622,Recommended for teachers and students
19623,In example of how a course should look like. It has everything you need to learn :1) good video) good materials) a teacher that is active on the forum) very well explained projects/5 would recommend :going of to listen second part of this specializations.
19624,I found excellent with Practical examples and assimilation Is gradual Learning .
19625,Good to learn
19626,i have finished this course and it is a good introduction to HTML CSS and of.
19627,Great course. Deep going this way
19628,"His is a very interesting and rewarding course. It would help if the format was broken up a bit more. Perhaps with some video of power plants, turbine, etc. I enjoyed the ""excursions"" to see the jet engine and internal combustion engine. More like that would given the material up a bit."
19629,"Amazing in it's simplicity! It allowed me to understand the core concepts of Project Management without all the fluff that exists in some on camps courses. Truly designed with the professional in mind. Quick, simple, comprehensive, all with a very professional appearance. I especially appreciated the real life examples and the case studies Felonies presented. They really helped me better understand the principles she was trying to explain."
19630,Great introductory course on SEO! Good foundation of the basis and feel confident about moving on to the next course!
19631,"It's not mere course, It's a way of life :)"
19632,"Your stars because the content is good. Not five stars because the english is not so good and for a non-english expert it can be difficult to understand, and the subtle contains quite often errors."
19633,"Excellent Introductory Microeconomics course. Its covering of the foundation concepts of when markets fails presented a comprehensive review of the foundation concepts of the subject. I have studied economics at the undergraduate and graduate level, and this course has taught me things I never covered in my university level courses. Outstanding introductory course."
19634,helpful!!
19635,Excellent. The whole specialisation is excellent. Good balance between theory and practice.
19636,His course helped me learn with more efficiency and i use for learn english
19637,Good into to basic tools. Would like more exercises.
19638,Excellent but very time consuming
19639,Useful and able to practice right now !
19640,"I found this course a delight to work through, thank you for making this!"
19641,"His is a great introductory Machine Learning Course. The required knowledge is almost nothing, so it starts really basic, but got more interesting on the last weeks.It focus on a practical approach. You will use GraphLab, a powerful tool that allows to easily start applying of algorithms on real cases, even with just a basic theoretical understanding about why this works.It made me think a lot how can I take advantage of this tools, and I'm excited about start working on some new projects."
19642,"His course was very exciting, a little bit difficult, but interesting. Thank Professor"
19643,very helpful! I think I will be an expert in Python after finishing this series.
19644,"Before unrolling this course, I expected to obtain some technical skill for creating game environment by different software products, etc. I was surprised: this course reaches the future professional to THINK ! One can't produce anything without know what he would make. His course will give you clear direction of your ideas about YOUR GAME environment. Like in the drawing: you should know what you would draw. Having the ""color palate"" is nothing without structuring in your mind your ideas, planning what you would do. Similarly is in my profession - architecture - there are some already graduated students who can only to draft what somebody else tells them to draft. His course will teach you how to create."
19645,"I really liked the course, and the way trading is design compared to other courses, even thought we should be able to take only some points off, many times it's partially well and would deserve only 1 or 2 points to be deduced, and we have to deduce all or none. thanks"
19646,I loved the assignment but getting answers to questions was hard. I think overall the course was terrific and I would recommend it to my workers.
19647,Very useful!
19648,"Excellent! Great scientific information, video and other explanations on animal evolution! You'll understand your best friend better and your own evolution."
19649,It's so much easier to learn more about patron and data by taking this course.
19650,"this course overall is great. the content needs to be more in depth and give more compact information in each session. also need to give more detail why we should do certain step instead of just tell how to do.the course offer resources, and this aids with further self-pace learning, which is helpful. the put resource could cover more content in detail.overall it is a good course."
19651,Probably the best and most useful Coursera MOOC on Android
19652,excellent course and will make you look to your time differently.
19653,"Very interested, and very useful. An easy apply it in our daily life."
19654,"thanks. His course makes me more confident in learning new things, to grow & change, to minimize using Coursera courses I am taking & will be taking. For all those involved in Coursera & this course, thank you soon much for having worked so hard to make these courses accessible, as I am unable to further my formal education, but I can still learn by unrolling in Coursera. Coursera is a very powerful source for me to be more competitive in the workplace. And this course will enable me to absorb more knowledge & skill in my office or other fields."
19655,Vice... the final assignment stegonography I found was difficult to convert RGB fixed values to 8 bit denial values
19656,His course is fundamental to machine learning and helps me to grasp the idea of it
19657,"The professor explain really good the material. The best thing is to review the book, it helps to understand better the concepts of Programming and capability of Python"
19658,Solid course! Correct doses of theoretical and practical knowledge to get started with in development
19659,Good course with basic Python concepts and exercises are details focused.
19660,Wonderful instructor - excellent teaching style.
19661,"His is, strictly speaking, my first class in of. And I squeeze a large amount of time to finish this class and learn a lot. I really really strongly recommend you to knoll this."
19662,Excellent overview of the topic and a good launching point for further studies. Requires some basic chemistry but otherwise easy to get into.
19663,Awesome!!Moving It!!!
19664,Great Course
19665,His is much better than the previous one. The quit and project design are much more reasonable.Good work!
19666,Great knowledge to build your own equity in decision making.
19667,It would really been helpful if you provided some reading for each approach. I could do outside reading but as you know you can find lots of reading which might be not useful for a beginner.The final test was not close by to being easy even though I did study. Thank you for that and that's a good job giving us a challenge to look forward to.
19668,"Vice, but I expected more (or something else)."
19669,"Again, thanks for From. Charles with the useful course!"
19670,"The course contents and assignment are clear and well-structures. Compared to the algorithms & data structures courses, this one was a lot easier (for me anyway). I would have liked additional content on, for instance, (Markovian) grid/fields, but perhaps this will be covered in the 'advanced algorithms' course."
19671,Great for beginners in programming as well as Python
19672,Learning can also be fun
19673,"A simple but information introduction to the Internet of Things, the hardware components that make up of devices, and the structure of the network that support them."
19674,"Excellent course. Down to Earth video, great approach. I really recommend it for those seeking to go a little bit deeper in the strange but fascinating world of sub-atomic particles. Thanks Proffesor Hitoshi Murayama!"
19675,"Awesome course, already wrote my first programs!"
19676,"The course content is really good. However, in the last module, some sentence restructuring would be appreciated."
19677,Very good course to start Machine Learning Basis. Excellent coverage of practical programming assignment.
19678,"5 stars, this is a perfect course with Impact."
19679,"A very useful course for learning how to think and code. Through Professor Severance, the Python language gets nearer the learner. To doubts in recommending it."
19680,It was a great course. The integration of quires during video is a great Idea. It keeps you interested. Great teacher as well.
19681,"There's a lot of detailed information here, but it's surface level at best. I don't feel I have a better understanding of how smartphones work.Although I am now more familiar with the teach components of a few smartphone models and the timeline of in/Android of development, I am not able to connect this information outside of base facts. I'm not even sure how the smartphone components fit together, or what they actually do.It would be a really interesting course if there were more examples, such as how smartphone components work together or a deeper comparison between the in and Android systems is used when discussing the development timeline of each model, instead of pure cognitive knowledge being read from a slide.Maybe these concepts are explored further in the other courses for this certificate, but as a stand alone introduction to smartphone technologies the information is poorly imparted."
19682,"I enjoyed this course greatly. I have been in a leadership role for many years, but this course was an excellent opportunity to test my experiences against current leadership theory. I enjoyed learning how basic observation and sensation can be used to avoid miscommunications and misunderstandings and to become better in leadership through better individual and group interactions and communications."
19683,"thank you for this course and the professional way it has been set up. the enthusiasm, quality and learning I got out of this are way beyond anything I could I have image"
19684,"Great course , very much information."
19685,very helpful！！
19686,A great course and a fantastic introduction to negotiation
19687,Very interesting course. The instructor is really helpful and knowledgeable person. Someone interested in internet should take this course. It's awesome and fun to learn.West of luck!!!
19688,Vice course but you need to be patient while doing the exercise.
19689,"His Course full of information which i was not aware of ,really thanks to professor Rindfleisch in addition, special thanks to Coursera Team."
19690,"One of the best courses I've ever had. The teacher was amazing, he really made himself clear"
19691,It is a good course with clear explanation. I recommend it.
19692,"Amazing course! The video are nicely edited with images, video, and sound track. Also, professor Geoffrey Each makes it super easy to understand through the use of various graph and examples. You don't have to be an environmentalist to enjoy the course as it provide many interesting facts and perspective about our world. Definitely recommend to everyone!"
19693,"Excellent material, easy to follow securing style that kept me engaged in small enough chinks that were easy to fit into what ever spare time I had. I also learned a lot trading peer assignment which was also great."
19694,"The content of the course so far is interesting - and to be fair, I've only completed the first week of this course.Unfortunately, the combination of multiple lectures within one part of a lesson (often with highly varying accents, reading verbatim from lecture notes) makes the presentation of the course material come off as very stiff, over-directed, and hard to understand. It's hard to adapt to the idiosyncrasies and securing style of a new person in a four minute video, at which point you get a whole new lecturer and have to start the process over again.A maximum of two or three lectures for the entirety of the course (perhaps with the occasional guest speaker) would be helpful. Also, either allowing the them to deliver the course material in their native languages with English subtitles, or perhaps having them record the course material in English in something similar to a classroom environment where they're accustomed to securing, would make things infinitely easier to follow.His 'too many cooks in the kitchen' issue is what I also suspect happened with the week one quit. I do not know who generate the quit questions but they seemed to require a lot of mental gymnastics for a multiple choice quit. Perhaps on my end there could be a cultural misunderstanding in how a quit checks your knowledge of the source material? Met me put it this way: in my previous university studies, I have never taken a multiple choice quit where the question starts as 'In your opinion...'Badly, I will probably drop this class - but the course has spared enough of an interest where I will probably be picking up some books or doing some informal research on my own about this topic."
19695,Easy to follow useful technique.
19696,"West course of Python I've taken so far. Cried with MITx's Into to Computer Science and learnpythonthehardway.org, without success. The learning curve was too steep. His one, on the other hand, progresses slowly and easily, but in the end, after a month or two you find yourself writing short programs in Python, which actually work. On't make you an expert, but it will help you to understand the general logic of the language, and start coming for real. Took me about a month to finish it. I highly recommend it."
19697,His course is a good introduction that includes an overview and includes Agile principles explanations for software product management.
19698,Very good 2 day crash course on R programming basis
19699,i like the course
19700,His is an excellent introduction to the field. I recommend it!
19701,A great beginner level course to get a quick view of stuff game theory deals with.
19702,"It was fun. But I think that would be great to add more various tasks and do something with the quality of the video, because sometimes it was hard to concentrate on the content.Nevertheless, it is good start to develop your creativity and open some useful tools for yourself."
19703,Great!
19704,"I have really liked the course and the way it has been presented. Although the course doesn't go into too much depth, it still gives a solid introduction to web data passing and the available tools for the same. I strongly recommend this as a beginner's course."
19705,The content is good but the contents have a lot of overlap. The instructor are definitely knowledgeble about the material and clear about the presentation but a lot of the same material are repeated throughout the course unintentionally. Think the instructor just thought it was enough to throw a bunch of things together and called it the day.
19706,Very good course.
19707,Very happy with the Wars unit above all.
19708,"Thank you for inviting me to be a beta tested for Practical Machine Learning. I completed this course at the beginning of October of this year. When I was asked to be a ""beta tested"" I thought that I would be presented with new materials. However, the only thing that has changed is the look and layout of the Coursera web pages. The video lectures, quires, and assignment are the same as they have been for quite some time. Were are some specific comments:1. The video lectures: To me, these are clear and easy to follow. However, like those in the other courses in the Data Science Specialization, this course covers a wide range of subjects but tends not to have much depth. When I compare this and other courses in the specialization to other moods that I have taken including Machine Learning with Andrew G and the Stanford Online do Course Statistical Learning with Revoir Haste and Mob Tibshirani, the somewhat nursery treatment of the topics in the Data Science Specialization becomes more noticeable. Perhaps in the interest of ""truth in advertising"" this course should be called ""A Grief Introduction to Practical Machine Learning."" In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I have an undergraduate degree in economics and an of and the in psychology with a quantitative bent. I have had lots of statistics courses, especially those related to ANOVA, MANOVA, nonparametric statistics, correlation and repression methods, and structural equation modeling. The latter is important in psychology because researches in this field like to measure latent variable. I had been an analyst using SPSS for several decades and the courses in this specialization helped me to migrate to R. Also, there have been may new developments that have become more accessible through R packages (like the fancier tree methods) that were not available when I completed my the. Thus these courses (and others such as the ones by G and Haste and Tibshirani) have helped me to keep abreast of these developments. To they are good for me, but I wonder to what degree do the courses in the Data Science Specialization actually make a person a ""data scientist?""2. The quires: I think these items are good practice and are at a reasonable level of difficulty. However, these items are the same ones that you have been giving for quite some time, with perhaps a few new ones added. A little cooling will lead you to the answers to these quires posted online. I recommend that you put a little time and effort into writing all new items.3. The final project: Again, this project is good practice and seems to be at a reasonable level of difficulty. And again, this is the same project that appears to have been given at the end of numerous operations of this course. And again, numerous write-up for this project can be found online. And again, I would recommend that you put a little time and effort into finding a new data set for people to analyze. His would help minimize some of the rampart cheating that I found in this and in other classes in the specialization.In the subject of cheating, when I was doing the peer trading for the courses in the Specialization, I would enter the code of the students that I was trading into the Google search box and all too often I found links to submission for the project by students who had taken earlier sessions of the class. That is, students were copying these earlier submission by other students and submitting them as their own. And I don't mean that they were similar: students were copying other people's work line by line, character by character. I found that to be quite irritating and I always reported it to Coursera. Of course, if the instructor would change their assignment once I a while, then this sort of copying would be impossible. Is it is, it appears that the good professors put a lot of time and effort into creating what are indeed a worthwhile set of classes. However, after they created the classes, they seem to have pushed the ""autopilot"" button and gone off to do their day jobs. I would suggest that re-engaging with these courses and reading some of the comments that other students have made would be helpful.Overall, I appreciate the courses in the Data Science Specialization and specifically this course. I know that these class materials took considerable time and efforts to create. I wish the instructor continued success with these classes."
19709,"Excellent course. It will take your newby patron skill to the next level and teach you lists, dictionaries and rubles (all patron data structures). I found the assignment to be challenging but not hard. Spent about 2 to 3 hours per week (actually, I crushed the course over the Was holidays and did the whole thing in a week doing about 2 to 3 hours each day. Moved it!) Good luck!!"
19710,Simply wish there could be more materials on ID3/Of.5 and AdaBoost
19711,"While the professor doesn't want to confuse the audience with proofs and calculus, I think it would be nice to have some extra video that explain in detail the proofs and reasoning behind the different formula used throughout the course."
19712,His is one of the best courses. I really enjoyed taking this class again. this class is not easy. you do have to put in the time and effort to study the material and it is well worth your effort. thank you for pulling this all together and teaching me!
19713,I don't want to this course to be over! One of the best courses EVER!!!!
19714,Clear video's with good examples. Good structure.
19715,I'm in business and this is one of the course I really appreciate! I think I will not only save time but money swell :)
19716,Great course content and teacher. Looking forward to the next one.
19717,"I'm just about to start Week 4 of this most interesting course on Learning. Barbara is clear and concise, and every section opens my eyes to even more ways of ""learning how to learn"". All round, this has exceeded my expectations. Thank you University of California from a of student."
19718,A very practical and useful course. I do recommend to do it.
19719,learned some very valuable tools for
19720,West introductory level course
19721,"Amazing introduction to Machine Learning. Of you want to start learning of, this is definitely a good way to start!"
19722,"I really liked this course, it's quite comprehensive for an online course and you learn quite a lot about how Private Equity works, the difference between European and Anglo Saxon Private Equity investment vehicles. The most important part for me was the company valuation skill that I gained from the course. It was my weakness and now I feel like I can approach of jobs with more confidence. Thank you Bocconi and Professor Stefano Caselli for the great learning"
19723,I have learned a lot. The things are easy to understand but useful.
19724,It is truly a lot of fun to experiment and to find your own way of designing during this class. Thank you!
19725,The professor reaches very well. I like the way by which he starts from and basis and use real life examples. Thank you :)
19726,His helped me with new ideas in my teaching and also the lesson plan temples will definitely help me preparing my classes in future.
19727,Great course!
19728,Good for beginner! Thanks University of Toronto and Coursera!
19729,"A really good class, thank you !"
19730,It's very useful course for the beginners and also the instructor taught the concept very well . The also gave many other information to improve our skill in HTML5 which was very useful for me.
19731,"Really good course and educated you on how to be prosperous and responsible monetary. Additionally, Flex provided a very good insight on 5 functional areas a prospective MBA candidate may work. By deepest thanks to Or Peter Navarro, Prof Are Cher and Flex."
19732,"Although this project is very open-ended with little guidance, it definitely requires the ""full-stick"" of data science to complete."
19733,"His is a great course and one of the best that Coursera has to offer. Prof. G is descriptive, clear and practical tormented towards the course. It's starts with very good explanation with the concepts and built o"
19734,Or. Charles Severance is an awesome teacher. His teaching style and the way this course is designed makes it just AWESOME and easy to learn
19735,great teaching. thank you
19736,"Absolutely a must! G, through this courses, demystifies machine learning and imparts useful skill without getting begged down by the mathematics - if you're path-shy. The assignment and their submission system are also easy and intuition and instructive, never leaving the student wondering what they're doing."
19737,"Amazing course.Very well done, totally recommended."
19738,Interesting course
19739,Vice approach of great issues! Highly recommended!
19740,"Great class, very interesting assignment, a lot to learn."
19741,His is the best course for a beginner to start working with Unity3D. The instructor had explained the concepts in a simple and precise manner. Thanks for this great course.
19742,"Vice course. It has touched week every topic, but the quires are badly done."
19743,"Great visual, content and lectures from the professors. Easy to follow!"
19744,"That to say! His is definitely introductory but who wouldn't take a course and get a sense of what it is to interact with Robert Miller?Great insight and a interesting position on what is finance! I must admit that I was kind of leaning towards this idea from the beginning and therefore totally agree on the ""social"" objective of finance. I hadn't thought of finance as a technology though and I must admit that I'm very fond of this analogy!Thanks a lot!"
19745,"His is a very information and good course for beginners who wants to explore basic statistics along with R lab. Course, I felt little thought when i tried to do R lab but finally got it!! Overall course was very information and would definitely regiment for those who wants to learn statisticsthanks for professors and the team of University of Amsterdam for conducting this course."
19746,I liked this information and interactive GIS skill development course.
19747,His course has really helped me in my understanding and appreciation of how research should be conducted.Thank You
19748,excellent stuff to start programming. A good stuff to start Python as well.I really liked the interviews in between the lectures. great work.
19749,It was really a knowledge worthy program.
19750,very interesting and useful information. A bit challenging for me to use the tools as I was not familiar with the software
19751,Really helpful in work.
19752,"Interesting subject matter, but offered in an insufficient way. Had transcripts, for example: AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT COULD of SERIOUS FOR LOCAL POPULATIONS AND THE GLOBAL COMMUNIST, THAT MEANS YOU – am I a global communist? And quires with questions that cannot be answered from the course texts. There are far better courses on this subject, from the University of Albert (Coursera) or the University of British Columbia (ed)."
19753,"Very good introduction. Very good presented. It just makes you want to learn more of Peter. I can absolutely recommend this course to derbies to Peter.is.Good methodology regarding speed, content and presentation of the course."
19754,"It's an excellent course from University of California, Divine.I would appreciate the course curriculum designer and faculty who have delivered the course through examples and case studies.Looking forward for the more information courses like this.Regards,Hemendar PusaProfessional Social worker and Special EducatorIndia"
19755,very good course
19756,Very helpful. Thank you
19757,"It was wonderful. I learned a lot. I am withdrawing because at age 71, I don't need to be writing research papers but just enjoying myself."
19758,His course gives very good insight into fundamentals of machine learning.
19759,His course would be much better if there was some actual substantive content. His course was not worth 35$.
19760,Such an inspiring course. You are helping me to see clearer Prof. Right & Team by being aware of my bases.Thank you for that :-)
19761,"Excellent course. I have been writing songs for years, some of which might be considered good. However, I always knew I didn't really know how to write songs as a craft. That's why I took this course. The course has now provided me with the toolbox to begin approaching songwriting as it really is, a craft based on skill one learns and develops. I very much would like to take a another course with At Pattison, because this one was huge fun! Thanks At, Thanks Berklee, Thanks Coursera."
19762,Good course. Well organized and comprehensive.
19763,"Very good course, well elaborated and useful resources.Congrats!"
19764,very good course and awesome teacher
19765,Awesome Course i ever had about the topic.
19766,prerequisites are very mandatory to do this course
19767,"this course is amazing . good to help how learn better, to motivate and do understand some concepts. I loved it and would like to do other times. thank you a lot"
19768,Very Good course
19769,"Fantastic, well presented class. I have really enjoyed this course so far and look forward to continuing to strengthen my social marketing skill and knowledge."
19770,Thank you for this course.Well presented.
19771,His is an outstanding course due to Or. Miss' extensive knowledge and passion for the Beethoven sonata. I can only dream that someday he'll conduct a course on the Beethoven piano concerts too.
19772,The best regarding finance!
19773,"The professor speaks really fast, but the content is fantastic. His course is extremely practical."
19774,Most fascinating!!
19775,Really liked the examples you gave! Great teaching method!
19776,His course is life changing.
19777,good course!
19778,A really amazing introduction to the of Constitution.
19779,"His course was very information, well structures and with plenty of examples and exercises for the students. I learned a lot of things about the job search, applying and interviews in America and I hope my knowledge will help me in the future to find a better job."
19780,"Excellent course, Prof. Andrew has done a really great work. I am following his tutorials on deep learning from UFLDL web site.I highly recommend this course for beginners"
19781,I wish this will be a nice and interesting course.
19782,Very good one... want to have this quality more :D
19783,"Very good, but rather brief. It does teach you the basis, but uses Python 2, not 3."
19784,Despite not having a state background it was very easy for me to understand the concepts in the course.
19785,good but lengthy video..
19786,great course to start with game theory
19787,"In in depth explanation of how to use Expel for Linear Depression and what the Output values in Expel's Depression mean. Note that the transcripts/subtitles contain many errors, which can be problematical for the hard of hearing or non English speakers, which is why I gave the course only 4 points."
19788,Very helpful.
19789,very helpful course from great professors thanks clot
19790,"Recent course content, but fairly basic. However, the peer grade evaluation are subjective and take too long to get feedback and progress in coursework. I will not be taking another course that uses this loose of a peer evaluation."
19791,A very interesting and excellent introduction to machine learning!
19792,"Of you are not sure if your email will sound good to the reader this course is the quickest way to improve your writing skill. It is simple, objective, practical and the lecture video are of high quality."
19793,enjoyable and well presented
19794,More difficult than part A but also more rewarding. Thanks Prof. An!
19795,"It is a brilliant course. It is creative, innovative, fun and educational.He ready to be surprised. Moved it and enjoyed it more."
19796,A good course for introduction of machine learning.
19797,"Moved the whole Environment of studying, learning with all the motivation video, all complied together.. For making the learning process fun and interesting."
19798,"It's a great course with important and nicely presented information. It could be even better if University Of California, Divine would make it more information and longer than it is right now."
19799,Awesome course. Thanks Yakov
19800,"Though the content is introductory and general concepts, it could have been done in a slower pace and a little bit more detail."
19801,"His course does go over some of the basis of graphics design, but I expected it to be a lot more vigorous. The assignment are incredibly simple, and I think that there should be no optional assignment in the class. The reason I'm taking this class is because I have a hard time motivation myself to learn on my own, so I need something that will really push me. I only spent about an hour a week completing this course, and I believe that you can't learn something by only spending an hour a week on it. Also what's the point of having senators if they don't engage with you? I know I could have contracted them if I had a question, but I didn't because it was so easy. I wouldn't mind getting feedback from a professional graphics designer though if they're available. Also seeing how many students misinterpret the assignment, it makes me nervous that they are the ones trading mine."
19802,Perfect course to learn programming and nice assisting staff. Encouraging spirit of peers and senators through the online forms which makes it easy to learn and apply the course completely
19803,It's a great course indeed
19804,Simply loved the course. Thanks for the material.
19805,Excellent! I have learning too much. I respect Andrew G.
19806,top
19807,Really great course to start developing games on Unity d.
19808,It's useless and lacking enthusiasm.
19809,"Thanks a lot. Through this course, I have learnt a lot of principle of writing email."
19810,I love it very much!
19811,"His is my first course on Coursera so i didn't really know what to expect and i apologise in advance for my ignorance. The course only takes you 8-10 hours or so to complete (even accounting for reading external sources) spread across a month. I enjoyed it, but it doesn't feel like i learned a lot and i think it could be a bit more intensive. Looking forward to R Programming (part 2)"
19812,The course gave me a vast knowledge about waste management in developing countries. I strongly recommend this course for professional and concerned about waste management.
19813,Excellent course! Thank you very much!
19814,Everything is well explained and I enjoyed in this course. Thanks a lot!
19815,Awesome Glass :)
19816,"It is easy to understand, so it is very helpful for those who don't have much Machine Learning knowledge.Although I have finished this course, there is still a long way to go in Machine Learning."
19817,"Excellent course, with good video lectures. However, the written course materials, especially in terms of sides and assignment instructions, suffer from poor grammar and an occasional lack of clarity."
19818,this course help me to understand more quickly and really a subject
19819,Great course!
19820,"Very well explained, but it should have been called ""Basic Javascript"" because I'm sure many topics are missing. Moreover, the lecturer kept on saying ""Now stop and write some code"" but it's pretty hard to imagine a code from scratch, so I would suggest having (many) more exercises. (The existing ones were also very simple)"
19821,Demanding but worthy; brilliant and well organized!!
19822,awesome course and lecturer!
19823,"Excellent course, good level and well uttered. North the time and effort."
19824,Good explanation. And good exercise. The exercise help me a lot to make a knowledge more clear.
19825,Staff are incredibly arrogant bordering on aggressive. The very worst of the pontificating profession - and what we long term earners and educators know to be all too common. I couldn't stand it so I stopped. Would never recommend.
19826,"Although I've been ""doing"" web analysis for more than a decade, I still found this course incredibly information and educational. While all markets are familiar with the traditional sales funnel, the review of the customer decision journey (CDJ) and the introduction of the ZMOT stage was an eye-opening experience. he instructor was very knowledgeable about analysis. And I look forward to starting the next course in the digital marketing specialization track. T"
19827,"His was a good introduction to understanding the Exposure, Aperture and Shutterspeed. Peter presents the information in a concise and clear format."
19828,Very entertaining and fun course that reaches the fundamentals of programming. The instructor was information and beat. Really enjoyable overall.
19829,Great you
19830,Course is good for engineers who want to learn programming.
19831,Excellent Course for all Pythonistas who want to get good practical knowledge of using Database with Python!
19832,"Is an introductory class, it helped me a lot to start code in Python.Waiting for next class in Kept/05."
19833,Highly recommend!!!
19834,Its a good start to learn how to use patron to store and retrieve data from database..
19835,Very good. Easy for beginners to follow up
19836,"Very well done as introductory course, easy to follow and detailed in the explanations. Helpful for whom wants to get closer to the Organ language for the first time."
19837,Very useful. Prepares you for every real life situations.
19838,I have learnt clot from this course
19839,Must like the Course about the introduction to ruby this course has helped me to understand more Nails and the active record i really want to say : Thanks! to the professor who give me the opportunity to take this course :D From venezuela! Racial mi papa :)
19840,The classical music is beautiful.
19841,"His is a great course, I like it a lot."
19842,"I found this course to be a very helpful tool in writing, especially for non-native speakers.I recommend all non-native speakers to take this course."
19843,Extremely useful and relevant for today's technology
19844,awesome course !!
19845,"The course is well structures and provides a good introduction, however, I expected a bit more from a course that costs 20 pounds than just a few clips on how to install and set-up software/create a github account etc. His information is available for free online on the webster of the respective software.I understand that such an introduction is needed for the course, but then do not offer it as a separate 20 pound module. Instead include it for free with any other 'specialization' you can buy."
19846,Very Informative and well defined!
19847,"His course will be a good revision if you have known the models before taking it. But if you are new to the models, you may not really understand them. His course tells you which models to use and how to implement, but does not tell you the rational behind (maybe the theories are too difficult).The teaching staff are really helpful and answer every question you raise in the discussion forum."
19848,The other courses in the even series are a little simple. His started to address some core analysis issues and how to address them in a real life situation. A good reminder and thought provoked on what should be trying to do within the enterprise
19849,"Perfect course. I learned lot of stuff and really enjoyed it. I am only giving 4 stars because as a non-paying student I could not benefit from the grade assignment. Is person who would never use the knowledge professionally (working in of), I did not want to pay for the certificate."
19850,"terrific presented by Andrew. Sides, video & tutorials presented by him were of utmost importance to help my understanding step by step: from a small/micro problem solving until the bigger picture - more complex systems - resolution. Relevance of the topics is absolutely unquestionable especially nowadays."
19851,"very coherent and comprehensive, a well organized class!!"
19852,I had learn in this course! More than my own university.
19853,It is a very good course!
19854,His a really good course. I love the way Or. Andrew reaches us. He makes everything so simple and easy to understand!
19855,Thought provoking introduction to the complexities of animal welfare. Thoroughly enjoyed the course and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in welfare issues.
19856,"A great introduction course for data scientists to use Google Loud Platform. You don't have to be familiar with GCP, because this course will cover the foundations, with focus on data processing and machine learning."
19857,Great content. Well illustrated examples from the instructor and challenging assignment.Moved the course.
19858,"Wonderful course, I will never forget the Santa example used to describe the Traveling Tales An problem. Absolutely love all the instructor."
19859,Looking forward for the Modern Sociological Theory course that was promised.
19860,good class
19861,The best course in my life.Simply super.Now i am choosing of as my career.Thanks to no for this fantastic course.Expecting a future course in DEEP LEARNING.Waiting for it.
19862,Very instructive and challenging course
19863,Very good course and very well organized. Is a must if you want you want to learn angular from the beginning.
19864,His course is mostly theory based and certainly not what i am expected!
19865,Great Course
19866,"The course was awesome ..The content ,the problems were all thought provoking - couple of times i had issues understanding the language of the instructor , sans that it is a very very good course and a must take i would say"
19867,"I had a decent understanding of Scala going into this course but after solving the programming problems and watching the lectures, I think I've improved my understanding of the core principles behind the language and functional paradise. I'm looking forward to taking my skill to the next level with the next course in this series."
19868,"Is stated famous stated by Einstein, ""Everything Should He Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler"", Andrew G and team has made this course simpler for anyone with minimal mathematical knowledge and programming skill to learn machine learning in short time. I am sure this gives a solid foundation to build upon. Thanks a ton to Andrew and team!"
19869,"Another great MOOC, with new knowledge obtained. I can't wait to take the next course!"
19870,"Enjoyed the course so much, planning to do it again later this year!"
19871,It was indeed very helpful for me.Great source of leaving
19872,"The i-weekly assignment mixed with the i-weekly lessons is a really great course structure. The audit on some of the video interviews can be poor, and I wish some lectures, especially the last one were more in depth, but over all great course with a good pace."
19873,"The lectures were brilliant and very motivation. They made sure the lectures are fun and easy to follow, always providing interesting examples of storytelling from different industries. I can only recommend following this course"
19874,Very Vice
19875,Good Stuff
19876,Great course! I have used the Pomodoro strategy every day since learning about it. I even have my teenage daughter trying it!!!
19877,Very helpful!
19878,"Great course but for the amount of content provided and how much was taught this course is certainly overpriced...still a good introductory course, teaching very basic stuff."
19879,"The course is very good and very demanding. But the assignment estimation time were, for me, really completely out. I used much more than 3 more times the suggested ones."
19880,"Clear, easy to follow.Very comprehensive."
19881,I wish the schools or colleges I attended years ago had offered a basic course on how to learn! His course is outstanding and very useful for someone genuinely interested in how to learn and teach others. I recommend serious students enjoy for the course.
19882,Great course! Extremely useful material and interesting tasks. Highly recommended to those who learn English!
19883,"course provides a great overview of valuable lessons, along with sound academic underpinnings, on how to be more effective, persuasion, and convincing!"
19884,A little too common sense.
19885,I am really impressed with the lectures. Thank you
19886,Good to get the basis directly from the creator of the language.Enjoyed the course despite I was told many times it's boring.
19887,"Really interesting and useful. The nodules covers a wide range of subjects regarding ethics, law and strategy issues. You can get tips and skill to put into practice in"
19888,Very helpful with a lot of tips and resources to practice. Thank you.
19889,It‘s a useful class and give me a enjoyable listening. Thank you for bringing me a lot of new discoveries.
19890,Precise and good advice for practical uses.
19891,Odd introduction to Python. I enjoyed the course in full.
19892,"Especially with the beginning of a new year, it's easy to develop the mentality of ""i anna donate more"" but with little planning or thought given past that. His course gave me a chance to think a little deeper on what giving, philanthropy, and donations really mean.Thanks!"
19893,"good game design introduction course, lots of concepts, great!"
19894,"Very useful, interesting and would completely recommend the course!"
19895,Very Helpful.
19896,"I had a little bit of knowledge about Python coming before taking these courses, but it was very insightful and helpful in my quest to learn more and helped install the things I did already know."
19897,Really great course.....but expect problem sets to be little more difficult.
19898,His was a nice course for me to revise grammar and punctuation. Thank you.
19899,Great lessons for start learning Machine Learning concepts (and not so beginner concepts). Great materials to review during/after the course.
19900,A good course for identifying the field of data science and introducing the computing tools of the trade.
19901,It was such an information and engaging course! Now all I have to do is to consistently implement those study technique and stay on tack.
19902,"It's very interesting course, what give you a basis of R programming language. The most interesting was the last programming assignment with real data set."
19903,"very interesting view of contemporary philosophy, specially the topics about philosophy of mind"
19904,"It was great! Especially, Prof, Tompkins is conveying the fact in a very tangible manner."
19905,The course is awesome!!! Really helpful! All the examples are really practical!
19906,good.Right include some more vivid case studies
19907,That I love about this course is that it sets the foundations for effective teaching while it introduces the topics for language learning and language acquisition. I'm looking forward to continuing with the rest of the specializations.
19908,"Andrew makes this complex topic very straightforward to understand. He is also very encouraging with statements that ""By now you know more than the average Silicon Valley Engineer""... Bottom line is this course helps new lies grasp and love machine learning"
19909,"Organized material, simple examples with on screen flow charts to explain the logic of any given concepts."
19910,"The professor is amazing, the course is really great"
19911,"Gives good insight, but could be more comprehensive :)"
19912,Gives a really good and easy to comprehend tool for further learning!
19913,it's super helpful and interesting!
19914,Great course!
19915,Lots of fun.
19916,His course did an excellent job of introducing the basic concepts of machine learning.
19917,Really worth to join this lesson.
19918,Thank you.-
19919,Learned a ton about Script writing. Who cares if it is MSU or any other University. The Professor teaching is what makes all of the difference.
19920,The course was very interactive and compelled the students to look further and think.
19921,Thoroughly enjoyed the lectures by M. Odersky! Unfortunately the lectures on Sutures seemed a bit disconnected from the rest of the material...
19922,I prepared Lesson Plan and I am proud that I could do it with the help of the course. It was fun to evaluate peers and the topics were inspiring.
19923,"I would give 4.5 stars if I could. First, the positive: I got a great overview of many machine learning topics and learned a lot in general, the professor is excellent, and the programming assignment have plenty of resources to expand your knowledge beyond the core requirements. However, in later weeks, as the assignment grew more complex, I became a monkey. In the earlier weeks there was a focus on the fundamentals, which while very frustration, are necessary to cement your skill. Later weeks failed to keep this up and emphasized increasingly isolated problems where it wasn't necessary to understand the big picture, and you can succeed (still with frustration) using blind guessing and transporting marines. The problem with this method is that real life does not always have an assured solution. That said, if you are self motivate, there are plenty of resources to address this gap, and if you want to learn machine learning for its own sake (and not just to get a certificate), I strongly recommend you take this course."
19924,"I am extremely happy to have participated in this course. Buds to Prof. A and ISB Team for addressing a fundamental human concern. I am sure that this course will continue to help lots of people clear up misconceptions on Happiness and live a Life of Fulfillment. It certainly helped me a lot. Thank you Prof. A, ISB and Coursera"
19925,West programming class I've ever taken. Letter than my college programming classes.
19926,It's perfect! He had a Musical Literature subject at a Musical School - and it was soon boring!And this course - it made me think about music in a new way and now I had a wish to share it with my friends
19927,"For someone without experience in Cava, but with other programming experience (C/Python), I found this course to be interesting and challenging. There's a lot of repulsion in the assignment, which made my head spin. .. but I thought the course coverage was quite good. I supplemented with the instructor's book.the main recommendation I'd have is more information about using the IDEs. A lot of my frustration ended up being about particulars of those."
19928,A very nicely taught course in a very friendly and entertaining manner. It is good as an introductory level course to Robotics giving a nice overview of control technique while investigation the basis in a bit more detail.
19929,Good introductory course.
19930,"I love Paleontology! His is a fantastic course, which makes me love life."
19931,It's better to use Python 3 version.
19932,Course is a great introduction to knowing the mechanics of Entrepreneurship. His course would only be a foundation and first step. Take this course to remember the essentials and build over it.
19933,Great course. Lots of useful tidbits and science behind learning that can be useful for practical applications when learning. I wish I had this course as one of the first courses I take in college
19934,"Positive:-Good practice with the exciting world of script writingLearnt how to use the scriptwriting software Felt.compose aspects of the video were helpful and instructive e.g. teaching us how to write a cold openAreas of improvement:-The beginner's course is entirely grade on peer reviews where one could get a range of divergence opinions on the same story, at times scathing and not constructive. Reviewers (who are supported to be beginners themselves) also at times give seemingly 'blind' grades without sharing constructive comments.The questions that you are grade on e.g. To you feel immersed in the story? Is the story unique? are highly subjective and solely dependent on the reviewed's fleeting references. It would help if the questions were more glanced and focused on the structure and technical aspects of script writing e.g. format, grammar, three part structureLessons were too short and instructions (less than 10 mind of video for each lesson) only for certain areas; it seemed like one of the major takeaways was to keep writing which is sensible but not helpful from a beginner's point of view.Suggestions:-To maintain some objectivity in trading: Ask the general comments section when a reviewed is giving his comments as negative comments from other peers could influence more nativity and vice versa.Give some guideline on reviewing to prevent the trading process from turning into rolling.Would appreciate more helpful lessons with deeper content!"
19935,"Very nice course, with kind challenging (for beginners, of course), but not really hard tasks. On't expect it to teach you everything, though, it's only the basis."
19936,Or. Vomer is an excellent presented. The makes you feel welcome and positive about each module. Thank you.
19937,Basis of Project management briefer in short time.
19938,"Long Introduction to Internet of Things & Augmented Reality Emerging Technologies, I expected a little more"
19939,lack of examples to lookout. good short video. good option for introduction
19940,A great course to understand the procedure for non-medico
19941,West teaching approach and superb explanation of all the course material. Each and every week is so well designed that I learned a lot of things in flow.Thank You.
19942,"Very professional, deep and comprehensive course for beginner web developer. Very pleased, I recommend!"
19943,"His is a great course if you want to understand how genet contribute to evolution and their roles in determining various phenomenon that occur in our bodies and in other life forms in nature, as well as the basis of evolution. Or.Door is an absolute delight."
19944,"Great course: concepts well explained, thought-provoking assignment that applies concepts, broaden exposure to the topic itself as well as how it connect to the other components of Supply Chain."
19945,Great!
19946,"I really enjoy this course, it helped me to understand how to stay healthy.Thank very much for making this course and I am willing to share it with others (:"
19947,It's awesome! But It is very very general!
19948,Excellent overview and practice for new alton live users.
19949,Must a great course.
19950,I liked this course very much. I get lots of interesting things. Will use them on my kitchen. Thank you!
19951,Well-devised and method approach.
19952,His course was incredibly interesting and greatly information! I am an amateur violins and loved the historical information about the composer and the demonstrations by the Aizuri Quarter.
19953,"His course is one of the best Data Science courses available online. His has taught me advanced Data Science Machine Learning terminologies and algorithms. The hands-on exercises are helpful in applying the concepts learned in the course using MATLAB/Active, which is really helpful. Overall, a wonderful experience to be a part of course offered by the very intuition and intelligent, Andrew G."
19954,Excellent though time constraint are a bit challenge
19955,"In easy steps it is explained the process of learning, there are many helpful and useful tips in this course."
19956,Gets you started really smooth. Great!
19957,It has been a wonderful journey through mind. He all have it but we know so little. Thank you for allowing me to come closer.
19958,a good course for beginning.
19959,"It was a fantastic introductory course for a non financial profile people who wants to introduce himself in this world.I wish to congratulate professor Miller, Pale University and Coursera for this course and digital adoption and, obviously, I want to recommend this course to everyone."
19960,"Excellent, all the subjects are taught in a clear and concise manner."
19961,A must for all dog lovers/owners. The course is well paced and explains how we can communicate better with our dogs and better understand own cognition.
19962,Great course!!!
19963,Thanks for all Prof. Joseph Muppala! Good Course!
19964,Excellent! Thank you -
19965,"I think the course is apt to begin getting a feel of data science management and needs. I have realised during the course that it is a fairly complex discipline for a beginner with no exposure to statistics and the terminology.Initially it might seem like over the top, but with some research and reading of suggested materials , one shall be able to get a hang of it in due time.I also believe the instructor have had to work hard to make sure the upper level course can be delivered as close as possible to the level of a beginner.By only suggestion is if they could add a list of sorts for statistical margin , explained in layman terms, which would actually enable quicker absorbable."
19966,His is an excellent course offered by an excellent prof.
19967,Great Course with brilliant people and resources. Any Thanks
19968,Great course for beginner.
19969,Great course and great instructor. Course covers repression models in great detail. The instructor's explanation of concepts and intuition behind why things are the way they are was really helpful to learn and appreciate the concepts.
19970,The most useful one for me in the specialization.
19971,Very good! It made me began to love programming!
19972,"Great course, I love bootstrap!"
19973,Professor does a good job in explaining and gives a heads up of the general errors encountered in real life working with is
19974,Short but Still Very Impressive Distribution of the Topics with Good Learning Experience
19975,"A good opportunity to learn business English, communication and much more."
19976,"I really enjoyed this class. I typically don't have trouble learning new subjects, but I was able to bring quite a few of these technique to my everyday work life. I now know when I am procrastinating because the process of something seems really hard.Thank you,I tell everyone about this class."
19977,"The professor made the content easy to understand. Is a beginner, this course introduces programming in a very thoughtful way. It keeps me focus on the right things so that I did not get creaked out at the beginning when the working environment looks very different from the experience of an end-user. And it step by step build up my understanding in programming elements. I signed up this course with rather strong motivation (my ultimate goal is to run statistical stimulation and develop statistics packages for other users), so when I see the course introducing the elements I did not understand at all before, I can see the power behind those programming building blocks. Hence, this course really made me wanting to program more!"
19978,"I felt the assignment were a bit too easy, and it would have been good to have a final project that required putting a few things together from scratch, rather than plugging some minor solutions here and there. The course otherwise is amazing, and thank you to Or. G and the course senators for the outstanding work and effort still being poured into this course."
19979,Good Hands on into
19980,I just love this topic. It is really fun and reaches you a lot.
19981,Well organized and good lessons/presentations!I suggest to insert more exercises/assignment to increase the student's skill!
19982,"I am no used to this educational system so I find difficult to follow without any proof or demonstration of the mathematical tools. I find proofs necessary for a good understanding of concepts. Another benefit of proof will be to have a more vigorous framework for variable names in the explanations. Even though this is more a practical course, it will benefit from being a bit more vigorous ; so at least people can make proofs on they own.Other than that, it is a great course. Very practical and to the point."
19983,Very interesting topics about war and human history are analyzed in this course. Very recommended.
19984,"excellent course, much enjoyed the journey"
19985,Excellent professor who clearly states the objectives and how to accomplish them accompanied by notes and video to help students learn material.
19986,Excellent material and excellent delivery. Thanks for the time and effort making these courses.
19987,"I enjoyed the course a great deal and learned much with a minimalamount of time, thanks to Professor G's excellent explanations."
19988,"Excellent course. Professor Miller has a nice way of presenting the course and explaining it.I was expecting more path formula and equations to solve in the quires. He need to have deeper information on these matters.He cannot underestimate the role economy plays today in the world. I encourage ""course"" to add more courses like this one and delve deep in economics matters.Wish you all good luck and thank you for this beautiful course."
19989,Excellent introduction to Unity3D. Wish it went more into the process of developing games.
19990,"Awesome, as always. Men rocks, explains everything and also makes textbook available. GREAT COURSE!"
19991,"It looks nice this training, but there are plenty of questions on every quit. I think 15 is too much. I've taken other courses and there are no more than 10 questions on each one.I enjoy the last assignment."
19992,"Great course. Would be more interactive and could have more detailed instructions for the Course Project. Last task for the Course Project uses a function that is not covered in previous lessons, which I think is not of."
19993,Excellent course with logical organised content clearly presented to the student. Quizzes and assignment were fair and easy to understand and at the completion of this course I feel that I have a better understanding of social media marketing and a few new tools and skill to execute a plan in a more productive way.
19994,Quick prime of what management and supervising is about
19995,Wonderfully designed course. Everyone should take this course for a good addition to knowledge whether one is a market or not.
19996,Great presentation of data structures.Good Capstone.
19997,"Well thanks a lot Or chuck,learned a lot of patron web structures and it's dataAnd your presentation of putting one topic is compared second to noneWell thanks again"
19998,Excellent course by David Rossiter. One of the best online courses that I have attended. Super Stuff
19999,"Awesome, Moved the course"
20000,Overall impressed/happy with the course content so far- keep it up-From an average joe that only took 1 such course in his lifetime.
20001,Generally good course. Very brief information about the tactics.
20002,very challenging course
20003,"Brilliant course. Fresh, innovative, inspiring. Describes finance how it should be. Explains complex concepts in very simple terms, even the economic principles of Robinson Russe are interpreted in modern finance. The best course course I followed."
20004,The best course in the field of mobile roots.
20005,good for law students
20006,"Exceptionally good Lecturer and the course. Booksite, video materials and assignment are amazing. Would recommend this course to everyone! The only improvement i would suggest is the explanation of nearest neighbor search in of tree. Critical information when to prone the search is not really explained so additional resources should be consulted."
20007,Learned a lot of thing that I was previously unaware of.
20008,Very Good introduction to Peter
20009,Great first approach to Project Management !!!
20010,Great job Or. Brooks!
20011,Very basic introduction to data science. The class is well-organized and suitable for new earners of data science.
20012,"Great course. Good for a broad overview. Of you already know basic concepts like repression, classified, etc from a statistics class it might be a little slow. Also, the class is taught using graph lab which is not a free software. Of you wanted to try it something else that is free, you could... But you will spend a LOT more time on the assignment."
20013,"a beginner friendly, introductory course."
20014,"I like the course design, it's efficient and productive."
20015,Really interesting and really passionating! His really pushes me to do a University of Design later :)!
20016,"Or. Each was engaged with students on video. I really enjoyed the interaction with other students locally on the 'Open Forum' portion. MOOCs gave me the opportunity to learn on my time frame. I highly recommend purchasing your mortification, you've earned it!"
20017,Great course. Professor Zelikow takes the entire world and gives us a clear and sometimes surprising story of the modern world. Amazing. To glad I took this course.
20018,"Despite 2 Universities I did discovered some new approaches to the way how to learn more effectively. In addition, it inspires to trust yourself and be proud of what are you doing. But ""doing"" is the key"
20019,"A powerful toolbox for learning and for empowering your life. I have started to put a lot of simply exercises and technique taking from this course into my real life, day to day, not only for learning but also for working and I have gained confidence in my learning skill after some years. Incredible course, totally recommendable for everybody at any age!"
20020,"His whole specialization is an outstanding program: the instructor are entertaining, and they strike the right balance between theory and practice. Even though I consider myself quite literate in statistics and numerical optimization, I learned several new technique that I was able to directly apply in various part of my job (ok, not in the foundations course, but in subsequent courses). He really go in depth: while other classes I've taken limit themselves to an inventor of available technique, in this specialization I get to implement key technique from scratch. Highly, highly recommended.FYI: the Python level required is really minimal, and the total time commitment is around 4 hours per week."
20021,Last section was tedious. Access to a year long graphlab licence was nice though especially since I graduated as an undergraduate in 2014 and am no longer a student.
20022,"Thanks for Andrew G and Coursera, this course really helps me a lot."
20023,"His course has great content and I believe the professor is very knowledgeable about this subject matter. However, at times, it can be very difficult to understand what he is saying. I believe he knows the English language very well but, between his deep accent and speaking very quickly, there are a number of times I cannot understand what he is saying. His is reflected at times when reading the transcribe below each video. I found it better to slow the video down to 0.75X the regular speed to hear him but that did not remove all of the difficulty."
20024,"this course give me wings,to solve my electronics problem,i really happy i can access this course any where in world and can study at my own pace............"
20025,I like the organisation of the course. The first video is so information yet so simple. Great resources have been listed in it and so subtly. Also I saw the organization of holders and lecture notes and everything in Github rep for this course. It s awesome. I keep stuff like that.. well numbered and everything. I really appreciate it as it makes life of a student lot easier. Thanks.
20026,It was simple but made the basis very clear.
20027,"I didn't like the assignment; it did not make me think of the taught theory, or teach me any kind of practical skill. However, the rest of the course was good."
20028,"Good information, good format."
20029,His course is so helpful for art teacher. thank you Coursera
20030,"Would have enjoyed to have been shown examples of breakfast, lunch, and dinners for people that are just getting started."
20031,The program very useful!
20032,Excellent introduction to Python and computer programming in general. Lectures from Professor Chuck keeps you interested in the course. Strongly recommended.
20033,Well structures and challenges people's beliefs and practices.
20034,Great course! I learned a lot and I could not find anything that I would like to remove from any of the courses.
20035,Rough but totally worth it
20036,"The course has several mistakes; the instructor forgot to remove some of the clips taken wrong inside the lectures, and the project for week 3 was incorrectly written. However, in general the course is very appealing; it's the main part of making games. And if some may think that you don't need to take a class to ""learn to be creative"", this course was an excellent way to put my creativity in practice, learn about how game design works, and read many interesting articles and stuff from different sites, provided by the instructor.Highly recommended, it's a very fun course."
20037,"Well paced and organised. Not too intimidating, but I felt that I learnt a lot."
20038,"I feel that there should be more assignment to make the course interesting. The last part just briefly explained about different database types but it also focused two lectures on Fig. There could be an assignment to make the lectures more meaningful or perhaps, a quit. Otherwise, last week is too much information to grasp at once."
20039,Quite nice course. Easy going.
20040,MUITO BOM!!!!!
20041,Great lessons. Appreciate the efforts taken by Professor to gather the data and create a learning material of such high quality.
20042,I wish they taught this in school.
20043,excellent teacher very accurate. Now i have so many ideas
20044,Excellent! Or. T is awesome! The in-lecture quires are the greatest
20045,"Easy to follow, and understand"
20046,Or. Chuck is highly entering. The pace feels appropriate for beginners. Of you were intimidated by CS50 this is a much more reasonable place to start.
20047,"good for novice programme,an experienced programme may leave it"
20048,"I really like this course, it helps me to camp up with machine learning topic. moreover, it keen me to continue the specialization and dive with the notions mentioned on the lecture, and i won't forget to thank the lectures Emily and Parlor."
20049,great class! thank you for teaching it.
20050,"Course 1 was really enriching, but this second stage didn't achieve the level that it's supposed, video should be make in order to connect with earners, materials should be upgrade to fulfill expectations."
20051,Very Clear! Very Good!
20052,"Exceptional lecturer , thanks Air"
20053,Excellent overview of information.
20054,"Very good cause, easy to follow... most of all. the concepts are very practical and can apply immediately."
20055,Will exercises are very helpful
20056,"I found this course extremely useful for anybody in teaching, teacher training, education management or any other professional for that matter because it centers around common sense and productivity. I started using the calendar and planner tools given by the course upon adapting for my use, and I am loving it because it has helped me and even my team to stay organized to meet deadline!"
20057,The right kick for a good start
20058,"Vice, but for totally new programme."
20059,I thought this was a good course. Or. Chuck goes through an interesting example of going through email data and there is plenty of time to do your own project.
20060,Good Introduction
20061,Challenging course for economists
20062,"Completely awesome course for anyone to start, very straight forward and instructing. Would recommend 10/10"
20063,Sides are well done. Starts out slow so you don't have to have any experience.
20064,a course made with compassion and creativity
20065,"Excellent instructor!The concepts, though hard, are well explained in a clear and organized manner.The assignment are very practical and helper."
20066,Great Course
20067,Very useful and it helps a lot for answering my questions:Why I learnt more effectively in middle school?Why I couldn't start working and focus on my study?That are those helpful advises for learning?
20068,overall very good learning from this course. looking forward for more courses like this
20069,Thank you so much for this nice course.
20070,His is a best algorithm course I have ever done!
20071,"I enjoyed the course and believe I learned something of value. I will say, however, that this is not a general course on Positive Psychology, but rather a focus on the professor's research on love and emotions in the field of Positive Psychology."
20072,Excellent. Run and very information. Very happy with the experience.
20073,will is great learning tool
20074,His course provided the fundamental concepts of saber security for beginners to understand the industry needs.
20075,"With the help of the great teacher and the great community, I learned a lot about basic, and some more advanced of concepts, as well as their practical implementation, which I found very interesting and useful for my further education."
20076,"Interesting, understandable, and logical"
20077,I am sad to see after accomplishing 11 weeks course there wasn't any certificate given.
20078,Studio was difficult to hear at times
20079,Great stuff!
20080,"His course was great, I learn a lot about the teach industry and it was very interesting."
20081,Scattered lectures that are hard to follow and happy
20082,I do not like the different language. I do not read fast enough to keep up and understand what is being said. I think we should have a language button to translate to English or any other language that takes sources from Corsera.
20083,"Great course, lots of interesting material!However, I wish this course was not so fast-paced. Of more time was dedicated to every subject and more examples were provided, that would make a learning process more effective."
20084,A good course to revise the concepts of capturing software requirements learned during a software engineering bachelors and to gather some of the newer technique used in the industry such as use of user stories.
20085,"I really enjoyed taking this course. It was interesting, interactive, and I loved how they features different voices and perspective in environmental management - it kept things interesting! Thanks for creating this course!"
20086,"His is a great opportunity for a better understanding on how teachers, students, and society put into practice the curriculum that would finally shape teaching in the classroom."
20087,"Thank you Professor Siedel. His course has accompanied me through distressful and hard time, in my first year of small business. That I have learnt will still accompany me. Thank you."
20088,"one of lecture is 20 minutes, nearly fell asleep..."
20089,An we have more about plastic materials?
20090,Very well done and extremely inspiring!
20091,Love the teacher..
20092,"The content is very well structures, the explanations are clear and full of useful examples. Some concepts were a bit difficult to grasp and required reviewing outside the material of the course. In general, excellent."
20093,"Things are way to deep for not programme, i did not enjoyed so much as the previous"
20094,"The Course was well suited for beginners and explained pretty useful concepts, but I think materials of week 3 need to be polished more."
20095,Great course. Great instructor. Great material.
20096,Awesome course sir. May to go
20097,Easy to learn ^^The professor explain by giving easy understanding examples. Not take time too much
20098,Excellent delivery. Challenging but still accessible. Very interesting content. Highly rewarding experience.
20099,Great job!
20100,"there is a lot of Errors in your words and you correct it by Messages but it make a lot of destruction for us , You are very quickly please be little slow when you speak , we need more Examples and please mention for us before the module what module we should device in your courses or out before go ahead on it."
20101,Thank you for a thoughtful class on leadership. It was a great course with a lot of quality materials. I've learned quite a good deal of helpful information on the building blocks of leadership. I can't wait to practice what I've learned in my work.
20102,There are many details don't explain clearly enough for a beginner to understand.
20103,Not enough detail and information provided in the lectures to undertake the final assessment.
20104,the course outline really equip an individual on how marketing is a core part of business
20105,"Extremely well planned course and course material. You won't find any course better than this. Of you know a bit of programming and want to learn more about web development, this course is for you!"
20106,Amazingly helpful. And for once I remember the rules I learnt.
20107,A nice presentation of the reasons for a financial crisis addressed to both people with and without much familiarity with finance.
20108,"A course without tedious learning of tags, style, properties and is commands that tries to give you an overview of developing front end of a single page web pp."
20109,Good course for begginers like me. All information is provided very simple and it's easy to understand. Also involves students not only looking video but offer books. In addition you will need to search some information yourself to complete some tasks.Thanks for this great course.
20110,thanks
20111,Very good and fantastic
20112,"I am loving this course!! The instructor is great, helpful and knowledgeable. I am already confident that I will learn a great deal about of from this one course. I plan to knoll in the specialization."

20117,Excellent course! Very complete and useful
20118,Perfect for derbies like me :)
20119,His course offers valuable information on the different aspects of Construction Project Management. The only critic I have is that the instructions/trading public for the assignment are terribly vague. The assignment starts with a simple example in the video which the student can reasonably delicate and create their own version. The problem starts when you begin the peer-assignment trading and realize the trading points are painfully specific. Now you have to go back and re-do your homework assignment after you learned what was really expected from the student. His wouldn't be an issue except that your second draft may not get grade if all of the students are done trading. Plus it's annoying to have to re-do work that you could have done right the first time but the guideline were unclear.
20120,"Autograder on final project is very frustration - no feedback on the code to know what it didn't like. Other than that, everything else was very helpful and straightforward for this novice. Thank you!"
20121,Covering basis - and dressing important issues - in an easy and clear way.
20122,His course is extremely well-organized and very well-presented. The textbook is very clear and is available as a PDF on the Internet or can be ordered from EPFL. The exercises from each week contain at one problem that requires Atlas or Active.
20123,Excelente curse introductorio a Machine Learning
20124,Congratulations Or Right!Perfect course!
20125,Great hands on course!
20126,"The course is a ""Life - Changes"" ! Andrew G is the best professor I have ever had. He is the reason I have decided to pursue my masters in machine learning. He breaks a complex concept down into chinks which are simpler to understand and thereby explaining that concept. I feel like I can apply this knowledge to any domain, be it robotics, finance, biology, etc. To go for this course, because it'll change your life. It has changed mine."
20127,Adept video and materials should be provided for this course. The lectures are not enough to understand the Statistics involved in data science.
20128,"the course neither explains statistics properly, nor reaches how to use expel effectively, disappointed"
20129,thank you sir Andrew!.. you are a great teacher and honestly i didn expected so much of advice and debugging technique.. thank you :) it was a beautiful start to my of world.. :D thanks a ton to the background team as well..

20156,"Wouldn't ask for a better experience. Professor G failed it with this little gem and it's easy to see why it's so popular with online earners. Exceptionally organized and appropriate level of difficulty for folks with a technical background. Of you're coming into this course without at least some programming background and matrix path experience, expect some concepts and programming assignment to be challenging."
20157,Great course to attend! It allowed me to discover machine learning algorithms and to see I use some variant of those algorithms in other mathematical problems in my job and studies. Andrew is a great pedagogue and it was a pleasure to listen his explanations.I did like the fact that there was an emphasis on debugging and improving the performance of algorithms. I am now looking forward to learn more and practice machine learning in the future.

20183,"great into to Python. Professor is great at easing you into the language and logic behind all the ""lingo."" Will work to complete the entire specialization."
20184,The course has be described in a very precise manner. The instructor takes time to clearly explain the concepts and the importance of the same.
20185,"Or. Reverence does a great job of organizing the information in a manner that keeps me engaged, and knows when and how to describe common errors in logic and how to avoid/fix them. The accompanying text is similarly engaging and information; it manages to explain quite a few concepts in each chapter, without being an overwhelming amount of information. I feel I am getting a great functional (vs. heavily theoretical) introduction to programming concepts and the Python language. The exercises have engrained the material covered in the lectures."

20195,"Great course! Great teacher! Run, engaging and very useful. I've been using the first four courses from CalArts Same Development Specialization to develop a game idea I've had jolted down some time ago and I've found them to be the best thing I could've done to get my game going on the Narrative and Visual fronts. I've been doing the first four courses in the five course specialization as an unpaid observer, but after taking these courses, I'm signing up for the full specialization. Of the quality holds true, the project driven fifth course will be amazing and well worth the money. The teacher in this particular course (Same teacher as in the Introduction to Same design class) is funny and entertaining to watch. Definitely goes the extra mile, doing interviews with great character designer and exploring their unique processes. Highly recommended!"
20196,Really good course. Thanks Andrew N.G.
20197,Great advice o writing best practices. One with humor and memorable quotes.
20198,Well constructed course.
20199,Good course to do and have a deep understanding in it...
20200,"I gained a lot from this course, but perhaps not as much as expected even considering it is a fundamentals course. I had hoped to learn a bit more depth, rather than the few basic concepts actually covered. That being said, the instructor did mention at the very beginning which aspects would be skipped and which would be covered, and those covered were covered very well, with the possible cadet that the instructor tended to teach as standard methods that were her preference or background. Additional research on my own turned up a wider variety of of technique that were not even mentioned.Overall, worth taking, especially as a very basic introduction for those who (like me) had no previous of experience."
20201,His is super nurse for html introduction. Thanks
20202,The student learns a lot of basis in a straightforward and fun way.
20203,Great teaching and good examples! Thank you University of Michigan

20219,"I am very unhappy about the Course Certificate for the following reasons : it doesn't state what subjects have been covered, it doesn't mention the hours of study involved. The certificate has a worthless appearance. In comparison I had a very good MOOC Statement of Accomplishment from the university EPFL which I can send to you if you are interested in making any improvements. jack.fairgrieve@email.com"
20220,Excellent course! Broadened my horizons in ELT! Recommend it to every ELT teacher!
20221,"I think it should be called Learning Now to Learn Letter. Nevertheless, it is an amazing course - it helped me understand a lot of things that I intuitively knew as a teacher and a student. It also gives helpful technique to tackle procrastinator - something I am afflicted with from time to time. I also like the fact that the team keeps sending me links on learning or research on the same.Thank you so much!"
20222,"Is a new teacher of students with ASD, I am glad this course was available. I learned great background and foundation information which gave me a better understanding of students with ASD. The course also gave lots of information and resources for further study. I will recommend this course for other individuals who work with or interested in learning about individuals with ASD."
20223,Very good introduction to patron data structures with great examples of how to use them
20224,The course was great. Everything is explained simply yet with a great amount of detail. The staff was superb in their support and responsiveness. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the length. I feel like the of/AJAX portion could/should be two weeks instead of 1.
20225,"I loved doing the course, and especially while doing each assignment of writing a story. The short guiding video were to the point and interviews with personalities was engaging, Thanks for the course!!"
20226,The best c
20227,"A good course for wetting your feet in the world of pp development. I'll this course was enjoyable and I learned many practical skill. With that said though, for someone completely new to programming I could see this being tough, and there were a few times instructions were slightly vague. Also with it being an outdated version of swift, twitching to the latest version isn't fearless. All in all, I enjoyed the course for what it offered, and would suggest it to any programme looking to pick up this new language."
20228,"Excellent explanations, simple and accuracy. Both teachers are very qualified."
20229,"A simplifies course that target areas of business writing which most of us tend to overseer. In this era of digitalisation and information overcoat, this back to basis method was really refreshing."

20232,Great introduction to arguing!
20233,really helpful course!
20234,"Great into to Python with great lectures , quires and assignment."
20235,I know Python but wanted to refresh and brush up my basis. I have not gone through the video lectures and doing the exercises directly. I found the exercises very well built. Good for learning the basis.
20236,Excellent course to focus on how to get the most from your studies. I
20237,Awesome! I took the course to go along with my current job training and will use it to help me advance in my current career.
20238,"Prof. Griffiths is outstanding! You inspired me each and every week, even when the topic weren't on my 'most desired' list. You are information and entertaining, thank you! Thank you for your brilliant knowledge in this field and encouraging me each and every week. I look forward to International Organization Management, any idea when this may be?"

20256,His course gave me the fundamentals to start with the development of responsive web sites. The learning process is well supported with some exercises for each reviewed topic.
20257,Great course
20258,Great teacher and content.
20259,"Really great course, but I would recommend that if you haven't taken many classes in this branch of the sciences to take a different introductory course, first. It can still be done, but might require more study and review of additional resources."
20260,Moved the course. The instructor are awesome. I just wish I could have taken the quires. I couldn't take them because I chose to knoll for the united version of the course. I learnt the major concepts of business writing. Moving forward I will have to keep the primary principles in mind.
20261,Outdated
20262,"Enjoyable course, good printers to learn. For me, it was a good break from studying hard, getting a little mental pause, while learning to learn."
20263,"Basically impossible to complete quires and course project using the provided course material. Door correlation between instruction and testing. Takes one wonder: Of I need to solicit others' guidance to complete your tests, why am I paying for your guidance in the first place?"
20264,Well shaped course. I can follow along without getting bored easily. Very useful and insightful into today's issues with terrorist.
20265,Perfect for an introduction to SQL. Still a lot to learn but I certainly feel like a can learn it.

20267,Vice course which gives the high level picture of of
20268,Thank you George for explaining each and every step in a simple but profound way. Simulations were really helpful to understand the essence of the first aid and I found myself several times stopping the video and thinking about the possible ways of supporting and listening.
20269,His is perhaps one of the most clearly taught courses I have had on Coursera. Thank you for putting in time to teach us!
20270,I really loved this course. It's very beneficial. He can use this course in our work or personal life.
20271,Perfect!
20272,"His course should not be presented by video. I loose lot of time by learn with others supports than Coursera.Even if I notice and appreciate the works to produce these supports by the teacher, I'm not a big fan at all."
20273,"Thank you, Or. Chamovitz! I enjoyed this course. I did WAPK 1 a few years back as well. Please do create many more courses on plant biology - yours is the only one available on Coursera. Some feedback points: 1) Very little interaction and moderation on the discussion forms. There are many interesting points posted there, but no instructor intervention. 2) After listening to the video i really did not enjoy the reading material provided - perhaps some other sites would be better. 3) The course syllabus is not enough to gauge whether the course is basic, medium or advanced level. Perhaps an indicator would help. For example, in Week 3 content on photosynthesis I was expecting a much more detailed discussion. It would be great to have more advanced courses from you and your team. Your overview explanations are extremely lucid and the visual provided really help. I think that very few biology textbook/reading material provide such a clear overview picture and link across concepts. Excellent course! 4) The concern re. GMOs is just touched upon - in such a case I think it would be good if you could take up specific queried, concerns raised in different countries and share your view on those. For example, It Brinjal in India. 5) I love the lab visits! Thank you again for this course!"
20274,"Useful, interesting lectures !"
20275,Andrew G did a great job with this course. He covers algorithms and others tools to do machine learning. Being new to machine learning I believe I got an idea what it is about and how to apply the methods.
20276,"It is very interesting to know something about the history of internet of things, so this course is very help- and useful"
20277,"His course it's a great introduction to several topics in Machine Learning.Andrew G it's an excellent teacher, he makes easy to understand difficult topics and gives very practical advice.Thank you for the course."
20278,"Super interesting ! I really enjoy it. I want more courses regarding dog psychology !Love Cognition , also !"
20279,"A wonderful course on principles in Linguistic presented by this lovely professor Or. Arc van Oostendorp and enriched with the discussions with Garden and One. Is a Linguistic and Literature student, I felt that they found what was a very nice way to spread this knowledge and, in my case, a more concise discipline in which I could refresh my memory for something but also get to know new information and different points of view and, at last, as an observer from Brazil, to compare a little how these things are discussed here from there. Thank you very much for the hard work and the enthusiasm!"
20280,very clear. It should be more exercise
20281,great course
20282,"Crystal clear and well paced lectures, good coverage of several interesting topics, amusing exercises.Thanks professor G and was."
20283,"The title of this class should have read ""Programming for Anybody that already knew a decent amount about basic Programming(Continuing with Python)"""
20284,"Last assignment is a big jump, but i like it so very much"
20285,"Presented in an easy to understand format, video are short which helps keep focus, assignment are well prepared which keeps student on the learning material. His course really helped me understand things more clearly.disclaimer: I have previously enrolled in Algorithms Part I (from Princeton)."
20286,"Great for the first 2 weeks of class, the third week seemed really balanced though and all of the sudden was about x the amount of time to watch video. I wouldn't have minded if the same material was spread to an extra week."
20287,"Great course, great lecturer, and a great experience. ;-D"
20288,"The concept and overall material covered was exciting. However, the lessons often did not connect to what was actually being tested. His course requires a lot of reading of the Dato frame manual. Of the instructor focused more on showing how to actually do some of the tested material, I would've given this course four to five stars. It the end of the day, this course does give an entry level data scientist such as myself the ability to do some 'cool' analysis, which I truly appreciated. Overall, I would recommend this course to a fellow data scientist. I just hope the instructor focus on teaching content with more focus and clarity."
20289,very good course. thank you Prof Are Strip! this course is amazing
20290,Excellent introductory course to machine learning.
20291,Thanks to this course I was able to enhance my knowledge further in the field of the Organ language.
20292,It's a luring start for a series of courses.
20293,"One of the best courses for life-earners - those who want to learn faster and better!The course content is very carefully selected and designed and the delivery by both Or. Barbara Valley and Or. Terence Sejnowski are awesome. Concepts are demonstrated in way that learner understands easily.Highly recommended course for anyone who wants to learn more in life!A Fig Thank you Coursera team, University of California and Or. Valley and Or. Sejnowski."

20299,A must for anyone in the work force or about to enter!!!!
20300,"Last paced but very interesting course. The teachers are brilliant and teach very clearly. I knew some digital electronics and programming, but this course helped me fill the gaps in my knowledge very well.Already enrolled in Part 2!"
20301,It was a great learning experience! I would like to thank Coursera team and University of Tokyo from developing such an insightful course.
20302,Professor Under makes the subject interesting by quoting real time examples in the video. His course will certainly help beginners in statistics. The entire specialization is a step by step process to master statistics.
20303,Great course to gain a theoretical understanding of the influence of digitalisation on marketing.

20308,The course is very interesting and educational especially for someone from the developing world like me.
20309,dr.Chuck is the best
20310,"The testing in this course is horribly drafted. Not is it only too easy, thus not actually testing students what is learned, the answers for some of the questions are incorrect. In the very last quit, I was not able to finish the course because the answer for one of the questions was incorrect. In answering how to translate ""South,"" the answer should be ""nánbian,"" but when I selected this option, it was marked wrong. Therefore, I have to wait 7 more hours before selecting an incorrect answer to complete the course."
20311,"It was an unexpected beginning but full of very productive understanding of the marketing and the case studies, i would recommend anyone this course!!"
20312,"Very well planned course, will go easily with your schedule, no matter what."

20327,His class was both information and enjoyable. The two professors made their lectures interesting and thought provoking and the guest lectures were an absolute delight. I highly recommend this course series to one and all.
20328,Great course!!
20329,Excellent course - the assignment help learn the glances of R.
20330,"Really enjoyed the material. The video were simple, especially for a beginner. His is the first course I completed online and the experience was really good. Prof. Baker is an able instructor and the concepts were well explained. The tests were simple though. Most of them took only one or two attempts to pass. That counts as a positive by the way."
20331,Great course!
20332,His is a very good course to understand micro economics & how to read current world economic scenario. I did this course once in past & I am not taking it again. It is good to do once in 6 months until you master it...
20333,Truly excellent and interesting presentation of the topic by a professor who loves the subject matter. Wonderful.
20334,Very Insightful and transforming
20335,Thanks to this course I learned the basis of Fig Data and looking forward to take the other courses.
20336,Professor is great.
20337,I will be great if you provide earners with additional material worth to read.
20338,"Excellent course for data analysis in patron, although the assignment are quite challenging and time consuming for beginners. During the course, I wish I could access to the correct codes after passing minimum score so that I could compare what I did with what common practices would be. He all code in different ways to achieve the same outcome, but it would be nice to know the most efficient ways/style."
20339,very good knowledge
20340,The lectures are information
20341,"easy to follow, good examples and practice exercises."
20342,"His course is not set up right, the assignment ask you to do things that aren't explained until the next weeks content, its kind of discouraging. In the end, it does teach you the basis of R, its just too bad that the way to get there is aggravating.The reason I still only give it 2 stars is because of the quality of the courses itself. There are many, many 1 and 2 minute video, these could've easily been combined. The teacher seems prepared in his lectures, he shutters and repeats a lot and makes a weird noise between sides. His shouldn't be necessary with pre-recorded lectures. The assignment and quires are also poorly written and contain spelling and floppy mistakes, which doesn't make sense because the material isn't new. It all just makes it seem like the teacher doesn't really care and just wants to sell the course to a lot of people without putting in much effort.Of you are not following the specialization I would not advise this course for beginners. I'm quite surprised to see the course get such high rating."
20343,I love the professor! Well organized and deep insight!
20344,"Excellent course, even for experienced practitioner. Does over all the basic details that you'll need to know to apply the principles to the field."
20345,The course is way to basic and easy.
20346,Great course to get you started into ruby on rails
20347,"Professor is nice, and the teaching is we"
20348,Very practical.
20349,His course was too repetition compare to the previous course in the specialization.
20350,"His is a very good introduction to Finance. It introduced me to some of the important things that go on in the business world, and to some of the history of how banks, insurance, and incorporation started. For a graduate student in path these lectures increased my interest in reading more two of the technical papers given during a lecture. Thanks professor Miller and Coursera for this course."
20351,I would like to deeply recommend this course to anybody that want to improve the way of teaching
20352,Great!
20353,"I am enjoying this course very much, it is information and very well organized and presented. I highly recommend it to anyone with an internet in the topic as it provides an excellent overview and includes current academic and non academic (mass media, world leaders. etc). perspective. The video lectures are exciting and I look forward to the time I spend viewing them, the core reading are relevant and there are good suggestions for those wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the material. Or Win Baker the professor for this course is an excellent education."
20354,"Good course overall. There tends to be many lectures that are just lists of commands. Also, they don't seem to be dating the material. Any lectures are several years old and still have types in them."
20355,Great course. Learned clot and am entrusted to continue along the Data Science Specialization
20356,very nice course. each and every thing is explain in detail.
20357,"Awesome Course. Changed the way I think about several things which is what I think education should be about.I don't think about money ecstatically anymore. And I have a better sense of what I'm worth and how to improve that. I also have better knowledge of how value for my education, business and job should be reasoned about."
20358,His course help me learn functional programming.
20359,It's an amazing course. The final assignment is quite challenging but fun. All in all a very rewarding and satisfying course.
20360,The content is amazing and is good to watch professors from outside the anglo world.
20361,wonderful course... lots of influencing tactics and analysis !
20362,"His is a great class for individuals learning the English Language, and as a refreshed course for those who use it as their first language."
20363,"His is of course my personal opinion, with all due respect for the Tutors. Plus, it has to be noted that I am writing this as a Mathematics graduate, and this course was most probably not meant for people with any background. However, I have seen similar opinions from people like me. Probability calculus and statistics are both enormous areas of mathematics. Introducing them in a 4-week course seems a really bad idea to me. The probability part was in my opinion far better than the statistical, the origin of every new concept was clear. In my opinion, the optical solution for the course would be to create a separate, longer course in of and states and require knowledge of the two for taking Data Science Specialization."
20364,"Or Charles Severance is clear, accessible and reliable in his approach to teaching.His course will guide you from basic principles to running your very own simple patron script."
20365,Very crash course that gives you a taste about the different aspects of data science and makes you want to dive in the specialization program right away!
20366,got the job done
20367,I liked it a lot it's very useful
20368,Very practical approach with useful information and great guests
20369,Really interesting course and material and a very good instructor. His would be a 5 stars course if it wasn't for the final project. During lessons some concepts of statistics were taken as known (which is okay). However the final project required to utilize a combination of all new learned material on a whole different level of difficulty compared to the preceding quires. I did not expect that jump in difficulty and enjoyed the course a lot but the final project just was a struggle.
20370,A good introductory course to Python.Intended for real beginners
20371,I like the structure of the lectures.
20372,Must finished this course yesterday. Totally loved the experience! Great if a kind of summarise text could be made available so that we can refer back easily.
20373,"It's a hard course, but very fulfilling"
20374,"Very compelling arguments and facts. I was looking for something to do and always enjoy broadening knowledge.The content was heavy enough to be meaningful, but light enough to be enjoyable. I enjoyed the discussion forms. I will be continuing the series."
20375,"Great introduction to web scraping, basically reaches you what you need to start doing web scraping on your own. Only remark, why teach urllib instead of requests? requests seems to be the better library."
20376,"Father interesting, but I felt the questions and programs were too easy."
20377,I just loved the course. Will() really helped in practise of each concept.
20378,"Great course! I learnt basis of current cloud computing technologies, even this is really tough course."
20379,In my opinion this of course is the best course that I've enrolled. Thank you Andrew G :)
20380,"Covers the basis we all think we know, but don't."
20381,"It's a great course, clear explanations and simple video.The missing star was lost on the way that misleading or undefined bias are presented, especially during the different decision phases.I would like to propose to discuss a case of a stock share in a timeline, to see whether this ""panic"" or ""overconfidence"" applies, and also in global macroeconomics (e-g. the PIGS bubble, the debt bubble)"
20382,"The course is quite short (video are usually only 3-7 minutes long) and therefore could be completed very quickly and/or need quite little time investment. I did not like that they do not have any written materials cause at some points they go over written sides very quickly and it is tricky to follow and understand. In the other hand, there is a lot of repeats and therefore you will understand everything in the end."
20383,"Great Course , Great Teachers.Its like McDonalds and I'm loving it!"
20384,Great Content!.
20385,"In extremely well-designed and easy to follow course! Heals with the subject matter brilliantly, and reaches some very effective (and practical!) technique which I'm finding very useful! Thank you professors!"
20386,His class is really of great help for a started in the field of machine learning!
20387,I am sorry but the Prof. doesn't know how to attract students to be more curious.
20388,Very Interesting
20389,Love the Course offered by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Will.
20390,"Really wonderful course, all the terms are explained in a lucid manner with a balance of technically and simplicity. love the concept of actually going global i.e. explaining the concepts by visiting the countries where major outbreaks of diseases took place or explaining concepts by showing us photographs from the professor's travels, which makes the learning realistic and wholesome, not to mention quite fun."
20391,It is the second week I am enrolled in this course. The course is amazing and the professor reaches us properly and passionately. I am enthusiastic to take this course and I enjoy every single video lecture to the fullest.
20392,Great learning experience
20393,Lots of interesting insight and good structure of the course. I wish the areas were covered a little more extensively though.
20394,Thank you and its a great learning through video and the support provided by the
20395,His course Is very Useful For Beginner in Web Begin I Really Enjoy With Studying it
20396,Fantastic! It has another perspective about the damages that interventionism did there.
20397,"His course is very interesting to understand the financial aspect and development of infrastructure project. The teacher is also very charismatic and the ""screenplay"" very dynamic. I recommend ! 100% !"
20398,Amazing course!
20399,"In my opinion, the course is too basic. Any things looks like teaching 5-years old children by serious professors.But the material is given as natural as possible and milestones are clear and understandable."
20400,great material and very interesting and wonderful research material
20401,"The content of the course was really interesting and made me think about things I didn't think of before. However, I found the layout of this course really confusing. It would be better if there was no division per week, but just a list of mandatory things and a list of optional things."
20402,"I want to give 3.5 stars but there is only option for 3 or 4.Given that it's feared more towards anna be managers in this field. I would have expected lot of case studies, and links to additional material for individual reading plus a mind write up or a project at the end.For MOOCs to compete with a degree program or an inside instruction few of the things I think that are needed areInterviews with industry practitioner which is a big plus.interviews/posting from people with similar background as the 90% of the MOOC students of this program who made it... this motivate the students from dropping from the middle of the course/specification programslinks to additional articles that the students can read at leisurewriteup/project as assignment that the students can pursue and publish (not necessarily for grade but as a mind jigger)One more thing that I think should help (not specific to this course) is that the student with the best grade should be offered one free course and think this will motivate the students to complete the courses."
20403,The professor is very good. He explains very complex mathematical concepts very clearly and simply
20404,The great research and technique described very effectively
20405,"His is a course all education teachers, parents and social workers should take."
20406,Would have gone more deeper in some of the topics which were covered at very high level. Overall a good introduction to the subject matter.
20407,I am learning so much from this course. Its worth every penny.
20408,"Amazing :D I'm really enjoying every moment in this course, the professor is having a great and simple way of explaining things, if we can call them things :D"
20409,It is very useful!
20410,His course is too short.
20411,High quality learning with relevant industry expert instructor Even Parkman. Excellent lectures. Tremendous amount of supporting learning material was also available with the course. Specifically recommended book Web Analytics Demystified is a great source of learning in depth about web analysis. Overall I achieved in my learning more than I expected from this course.
20412,Very interesting course! I recommend it to everyone interested in machine learning. Even though no path knowledge is needed it is getting refreshed with the course.The only problem I see is that there is no real step to work on. I do not know where to go next.
20413,nice and concise introduction!!!
20414,Very practical and instructive course. Thank you to the organizer.
20415,Great course with insight on the Social Media Landscape
20416,"The instructor is very good at explaining a wide range of notions used in business modeling, statistics and probability theory. Would have liked to get a bit more in-depth insight into certain topics but this course is called ""Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling"" and does very good what is supposed to do.The reason I am not giving it a perfect score is because I felt like the assignment were too easy and the video were a bit too long relative to the amount of information provided."
20417,His course was nicely contracted and fun. It contained a lot of helpful information for a person desiring to teach English as a second language. It helped me to move closer to my own approach and philosophy to teaching language. I would indeed recommend this course to others. I may recommend this course to my teaching staff. His is reasonably prices and information.
20418,To far one of the best online courses on the topic I have met.
20419,Fairly good for beginner!
20420,I've learned a lot in machine learning by this course!
20421,"Excellent course to give an overview of the Financial World. Of you want to know the finances of your project or what the Finance Department in your organization does, this is the course to take. The course strikes the right balance between theory and practical examples and perfect for earners with little or not Financial experience. A big thanks to Professor Lesion. Moved and enjoyed the course."
20422,"Great Course, Run, and Practical. Love it!"
20423,Great course!
20424,Very information and well taught. Would definitely recommend!
20425,It is incredible how Proffesor Siedel manage to turn a MOOC into a really dynamic and practical course. Very topic is explained with daily life examples which makes easier to understand the concepts.Now I feel more prepared to perform negotiations and eager to continue developing my weak spots!
20426,Thanks this is an excellent curse.
20427,"I appreciate the nuts and bolts focus on implementation that facilitate development of intuition, intuition that for me at least does not come from presentation of the mathematics in isolation."
20428,"His course taught me how my brain works, and let me knew what are the points of strength and weakness that I have in my ways of thinking."
20429,"His was a very helpful course, as well as entertaining."
20430,"lessons are very clear and rich of links to external material, and instructor is communicating effectively"
20431,"Very good information with a fantastic understanding of the variety of artists. However, I almost dreaded logging in to watch the lectures; they were often boring me to tears. Were this information presented in a more engaging way, this review would be much higher."
20432,"A good introduction for ""beginners"", ak people who are not involved, educated or interested in public health, healthcare. Alternatively, seek another course because it is very simple."
20433,Does a great job in helping you understand Cava concepts.
20434,"The topics in this course are all useful for a Cava developer. The learner should not only learn from the video and the sample programs, but also the reference resources introduced by the teacher."
20435,"Great course, educational and fun as well."
20436,Brilliant I really enjoyed it!
20437,A great course to teach the basis of this software!
20438,"His is the BEST machine learning course for everyone.Easy to understand and straightforward!Thank you Andrew G, lovely was, and warm hearted subtle groups !"
20439,Great course
20440,"I complete this very easily , this is only possible due to the support of senators.Thank you to all the senators for their help."
20441,"Python is a really good programming language and it was presented in the best possible way! The lectures, quit, assignment and the book - especially the book - all went together really, really well.In summary, one of the best put-together MOOC courses i've had the pleasure of attending. Thanks a ton!"
20442,"In a whole I am satisfied with he expanse of the course curriculum. However, I wished it covered certain in greater depth such as the Quantitative methods of Marketing Research. Also certain parts of the Consumer Behaviour section were quite repetition."
20443,Seems like a course designed to sell their books
20444,Great course!
20445,"Simply the best online course I've ever taken. Great pace, very engaging, well designed."
20446,"I have sat through 4 of the lessons and I am not very impressed. I fell that the topic is very interesting, but the professor does not do a very good job explaining the algorithms. It may be because I do no have the textbook, but overall a rather poor course. There need to be a little more explanation beyond the sides."
20447,"I did come away with some good books/stories for reading, but would have like them to be included in the course the way it is in the Getting and Description module. I found the video did not always lead up to the assignment, and I think the assignment could have been more clearly laid out. I still came away learning, but it did not feel very structures. To be fair, character is a sort of amorous subject to begin with."
20448,very efficient
20449,"It is definitely a great course, from which I have enjoyed so much of functional programming and Scala. Hopefully, I can achieved other courses related to functional programming."
20450,Was great I enjoyed the whole project working with processing apples
20451,"""Introduction to Same Development"" was amazing course personally. Through taking the course, I gained a greater appreciation and interest in creating and developing games."
20452,"It has been 40 years since I took my last art course (and that was in elementary school). While I enjoyed making posters in high school and college, those were done by hand. I had ZERO experience with computer graphics, and was quite nervous starting this course. I liked the way the instructor ceased into it - bringing less experienced artists along slowly, and constantly encouraging us to practice and experiment. By the th week, I figured out my computer's basic graphics design program, and was really enjoying playing with designs. I look forward to taking the other classes in this specialization."
20453,"Course has good breadth and structure, exploring the economic and political side of international energy, however it would be good if a basic technical understanding of energy is incorporated.Some material is rather outdated / inaccessible"
20454,A really enjoyable course that was helpful and enlightening. It got my creative juices flowing and gave me some tips and tools to help me along the way. Recommended to anyone interested in writing anything.
20455,"A good overall module with interesting Information that can be applied to every-day work routine. Also the PDFs that accompany each week's module are very good and you can pain out and keep them for future reference. Of I have to make a negative comment is that I have found the tests too easy to pass, however, the important is that w"
20456,"Well explained video, But very short course. Only 1 or 2 (short) video per week!"
20457,Exceptionally well prepared and beautifully executed.The lectures are interesting and to the point. The programming assignment are both helpful and student-friendly.Andrew is both an expert and a great teacher. Not a commonly found combination.
20458,"The video are fine. But, It's SIMPLY TERRIBLE to force people to pay to be able to do the quires. There was no such a thing in the first two courses (by the way, I gave high rates for both). It is of to pay for the verified certificate, however, disabling the functions in the course is a wrong way to earn money, because people who want to learn the course might not necessarily want the certificate, and this is unfair to them because it limits the resources available. His whole Specialization thing starts to make me feel like you guns are in urgent need of money, rather benefiting the community. Remember there are tons of free resources on the internet, and this only undermine your strength. You will lose tons of potential fan. Stop being seemingly arrogant."
20459,i think its good
20460,It was a bit hard to follow the instructions.
20461,Professor Indranil Supra is apt in his explanations.Course Material is highly relevant. Good foundation course for cloud computing.
20462,Good course. A few problems at the beginning of the course are from SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) book.
20463,Excellent course with very interesting topics covered and adequate examples!
20464,Too Last. Video is too short and spend a lot of time in the summary.
20465,"The course feels pretty shallow and it ignores all the interesting stuff like proofs. There is no written material available, so if you can't follow the lectures, poor you. Quizzes aren't very well formulated and sometimes the correct answer is more of a matter of opinion rather than a hard fact. Valuation seems to be based solely on peer review and there are no model solutions available, so the points you'll get may vary depending on how your peers understood the assignment and if they were interested in the review process at all.By overall feeling is that nothing was quite challenging on the course, and I didn't learn much more than what I could have learnt by reading a few paragraphs per topic from Wikipedia. I also felt that the programming assignment were quite dismount from the core, tough I don't feel like I understand the core better than before the course because none of the assignment made me think why something works, rather than that we just mechanically reproduced the examples shown in the lectures."
20466,Excellent course covering the basis of Personal Branding. It was very interesting and it helped me cement my focus and write my mission statement. The staff and other students were very suppurative and engaged.
20467,Great course! I learned so much about different types of converted. Deep it up the good work!
20468,Great course for somebody who wants to learn the basis about Finance.
20469,Very helpful!
20470,The course exercises are medium-hard. But the topic coverage is spot on.
20471,Interesting and Interactive
20472,"His course is almost outstanding. Half of the presentations are top-notch reviews of the relevant highlight of their subject matter. Half of the rest are logical, but somewhat perfunctory reviews of similar sets of highlight, and finally, the other quarter are sadly hampered by having no visible organization, with delivery that could only have been improved by rehearsing the narration a couple of times before the lecture was videotaped. I give most praise to presented Connelly, Hope, Bible-Jacobsen, Sørensen, Puny, and All. These lectures alone make the course eminently worthwhile."
20473,as the name suggests this is really an effective altruism
20474,"To far it has been really cool journey through this course. Lectures are concise, practical and further reading are well selected and offer a broad source of knowledge."
20475,Moved it .West MOOC specialization i have attended.Thanks a lot!!!
20476,I believe that this course make me more comfortable writing. I like the lessons and the teacher is very clear in application.
20477,In easy to follow and information class. The homework is also fun.
20478,"Although I have been studying programming for four years, this course still managed to surprise me in terms of content offered - really interested for the image editing and forgetting from HTML and of. Really worth the money!!"
20479,"His course is awesome, I considered myself to be a good student, and during this course I learnt that I was a good student because I had discovered various technique that are taught in this course, I didn't know I knew them and that they were the responsible for my good grades. I also discovered new technique that I didn't know, and with them I can now become an excellent student and learner."
20480,You will never see any photo the same ever again. Fantastic course. Supplemental reading are wonderful. To grateful to the folks at MoMA for this.
20481,Very information and easy to follow. The strategics and principles taught can be used in everyday life and in a professional setting. I am eager to continue with similar courses taught by this professor.
20482,Great content! Well explained and easy to understand.
20483,Good Course for the biginner
20484,Extremely interesting and well delivered.
20485,"Too basic knowledge, not enough information about target therapy, everything is explained without going into any details"
20486,"Very useful course, it brings new information about learning and I can guarantee you that it'll help you in others courses and much more. It has completely changed my journey through learning."
20487,"His course is beyond abundant in great information. However, there is almost too much information to take in , and absolutely too much information to be able to study in just and hour a day. It needs to be stretched out into 6 weeks instead of 4 to accommodate those with an already busy schedule. For example, one 8 minute video might require an allotment of one hour to properly clean all the provided information. You will need to take notes on almost every word spoken so the pattern will be hit play, pause write out the last couple of sentences (the instructor speaks very quickly), hit play , pause and repeat until the end of the video and then re-watch it in order to absorb everything as one.And beware, in the peer reviews you will need to bullet and highlight EVERY point required extremely specifically in order to get full credit. For example, for the first essay, I wrote it out in ESSAY form as was specified and had all of the required points written out exactly how it was instructed. However, because I did not put into a basic outline form, I received a failed score. I submitted the EXACT same content in bullet-ed and highlight form (which was NOT what was assigned) and miraculous received 100%."
20488,Super useful and practical!
20489,His subject could be more productive if they'd go a little bit more into details on how to start and apply all the strategics they have taught us.I do appreciate the hard work and knowledge sharing on this course.
20490,"Great information, great teachers, I love"
20491,"I have been quite disappointed by this class. There were no suggested reading in addition to the quite basic video. But the worst were the quits. 90% of the answers to the multiple-choice questions were the top option!! I could have pass the tests without having listen to the video. Were those tests or jokes? You should do this class only if you know absolutely nothing about economics, because this is the most basic class."
20492,"Good course, gently showing an introduction. Had the playspeed at 1.six the entire time though, otherwise they talked too slow."
20493,"It has a very interesting topic to know about, I only wish they could fix the subtitles to a more organic English"
20494,great course and most helpful these days
20495,EXCELLENT COURSE ABOUT IMPROVE LEARNING. I like Course put subtitles in Spanish language. Sometimes I can not understand all the American English and I check it in the subtitles.
20496,"Some of the video were a bit fast (too much content), but a very interesting course."
20497,"Good for beginners to programming. A bit slow if you already know programming, and just want to learn Python."
20498,Really complete and useful
20499,Professor makes the complicated process easier with his detailed lecture. His course is really great for beginners to learn how to make games and the concepts of games. Thank you professor!
20500,Excellent way of teaching interactive. Very good exercise problems to revise and learn by practice. Occasional use of humor also adds interest to the course.
20501,"His is a good course for both who is starting as for those who already have a knowledge and seek advice and new ideas to develop stories for games.However, I think that is ideal for everyone who wanted to learn how to communicate for team the idea of the game."
20502,the best way to learn organization and analyze it
20503,Extremely practical lessons that can be applied at work immediately.
20504,Thank you a lot i find this course very useful and interesting
20505,Good way to refresh your knowledge about PMP .. but not qualifying as a professional course
20506,"Lectures and material we're really good. Haven't done the practical part, so can't say anything about it."
20507,"His is the best course that I ever had in my lifetime. It the time of signing-up for this course, I was bit skeptically that how someone can teach us happiness and could be it be a spiritual discourse?But I'm happy, I was proved wrong. His course has no spiritual discourse and methods taught in this course are complete based on scientific facts and 100% practical. Having practised few technique,I feel a positive difference in a way I see & feel experiences.Thank you Prof.A for having delivered this course on Coursera. To wonder this is one of the highly rate course in the webster."
20508,"Good, but gives the very basis."
20509,Thanks for this really great course and overview on the world history.
20510,Very great course for who want to know more about machine learning. Very detail and easily understand.
20511,"to me as a total newby in the topic the content was really interestinghowever, its presentation. well. I truly thank the teachers for bringing together the review of all the approaches. but the manner of presentation was so artificial I couldn't help thinking just - when will the real learning begin? without all the silly role plays?again, thanks, I learned a lot from the course. but I did also struggle through it because of the teachers' manner of presentation"
20512,"Is a 24 or military officer from a service academy I would like to complement the instructor......He is doing a great job, especially given no military service and direct experience in battle. I complement him."
20513,Awesome experience
20514,Solid Material as an introductory course and gives glimpse on the new horizons on computer vision.
20515,Consider my review this time.
20516,good. must be followed.
20517,"The transcripts are not actually same, so its difficult sometimes to get what speaker is saying as accent is hard to understand.Content is good but its not depth for engineering students"
20518,Very well structures and presented - and great supporting notes
20519,The course contents are great!But is such a big subject for a single course. His should be a specialisation.
20520,"Vice instruction and instructor but if i do not have any idea about health education, it would have been difficult to me. we need also some more details (larger course)."
20521,outstanding and thought provoking

20542,Was great to start seeing how patron can be applied to scraping web data
20543,Great course. In size but still can makes a change to you.
20544,"The information in the course was really excellent and was set up in a way that it wasn't overwhelming. I wish I could give four and a half only because some of the video explaining procedures were really long and were obsolete, and also because different parts of the site would say that I needed to submit something and others would say that everything was received so it made me really nervous - at one point the site was telling me that I was late in submitted my work and that I'd need to sign up for a later class but it turns out my assignment had been submitted and grade before the cut off time so that alert just really grizzled me if anything."
20545,"His was a great course for anyone who has ever wanted to try their hand at script writing. I am brand new to script writing and I applied every lesson I learned in this course and did some research on my own to develop my pilot. You will feel accomplished once you complete this class, it is worth it!"
20546,its a must. cause learning is a lifetime thing
20547,"I have only completed Week 3 so far but I am enjoying the course immensely so far. The instructor, Andrew G, does a great job of explaining complex concepts in a clear and concise manner. I found that the programming assignment were extremely useful in understanding the concepts."
20548,"Very good, everything nicely explained and a humorist teacher."
20549,It is a great course
20550,Good Course. The lectures are useful. But you will need to search a lot to complete your assignment!
20551,His is a tremendous course which revived my intellectual curiosity after many years out of structures education. I am now much looking forward to completing Part 2 of the course. By thanks to Professor Zelikow.
20552,Love this course!

20579,Really great - thank you!
20580,Wonderful course! Professor Fowler is very engaging.
20581,"Some good case studies and interesting content, but it's a 50,000 foot view of marketing. I was seeking a more technical and channel specific insight. His is much more conceptual and high level, so it was less useful for me."
20582,For JavaScript best course
20583,"By name is Adithya C.G. I am studying in my sophomore and final year of my M.Lech Industrial Biotechnology course (Master's) at SASTRA University, Thanjavur, Family Had, India (2015-2017 batch). The course is very information. The video are excellent."
20584,"this course is really fun, inspiring and different from all the others. I'm loving those old happier teaching the young how to be rebellious and innovative!!"
20585,"I liked this course, but there were a couple of advanced topics (More Data, WatchOS/TvOS) that I wish we could have more time to spend on. I feel like there wasn't enough time to complete the assignment as we had in the previous courses."
20586,"It's an easy, interesting and valuable MOOC which is giving me AMAZING tools for my studies."
20587,Great Course
20588,"His was a great course and gave me a very good starting point for HTML, CSS and of. The only negative I found was that the of module seemed a bit rushed and the assignment at the end of last two nodules didn't really test my understanding of of concepts very well. They were too simple because the started code had a lot of things already written out. Taking them more barebones and having the student fill out most of the details would be a more hands-on and useful activity in my opinion."
20589,it is nice how to learn baths by this way < cause i hate the way of egyptian Mrs in my university teach us by reading from books which already i have in my hands and solve the same boring examples >thank you course :D
20590,"amazing explanations, pushes candidate to try hard with clues.program justified the name ""programming for everybody""count be better"
20591,"Well course reaches basis of patron but you should always refer to patron documentation in order to understand the concepts correctly. To the course staff, please update the sides where Python2 is used to python3."
20592,"A very interesting course, not only for beginners but also for people who have already heard of the game theory and who want to deepen their knowledge!"
20593,Very well made and delivered.
20594,"The lessons are very well planned, small and compact yet information. The design of the video is superb. It encourages you to focus on the narrative and never districts from it. I enjoyed taking it and plan to follow up with the other courses in this specialization. I do wish I could do the last project as well, even if I couldn't submit it for trading as I have taken the free course."
20595,"Good trading , easy to understand and was explained clearly."
20596,Amazing. The concept was broken into logical unit which made it easy to understand.
20597,"Having no experience with programming, this course was perfect for the beginner. It was just the right mix of information of why and how coming works accompanied by hands-on creating in a coming platform. I really enjoyed this class."
20598,"The Microbiome course has been a great course, I enjoyed each part of it. Thank you for all efforts to put it together and to make it available to everyone. It would be great if some of the reading which are part of the course can be all made available outside the pay wall.I wish a great success for the American But Project, including Canada, and later include Mexico.BIG THANK YOU!"

20603,Great course! Thanks a lot
20604,"His MOOC has great, engaging and clarifying content. The presented concepts, tools and technique by Professor Weigh Thompson were of great help and immediate application. I felt like buying each of recommended book in order to dive deeper in each of these exciting subjects.Thanks a lot, Fellow -Northwestern University and Coursera. ;)"
20605,I have learnt a lot in this course. Also it is great that the methodology and algorithm are taught systematically
20606,"Everything is well explained, and the assignment are interesting and fun to make."
20607,"After this course you will spend your most valuable resource (time) more effectively while getting knowledge you want to get. Lots of great concepts, tools and tips, which can be applied to real life situations."
20608,Great course for preliminary study in machine learning
20609,Seemed a bit basic.
20610,A truly great introduction to machine learning!
20611,In excellent introduction to the world of Data Science for a layman.
20612,"In exciting and worthwhile introduction to the philosophical fundamentals! While there was not as much focus on the major philosophers themselves as I was expecting, I gained a lot from this course and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about philosophy."
20613,Very useful information in this course and the entire specialisation
20614,The lectures and assignment questions are more about the history of the internet and HTML. although I've finished the course but it wasn't as good as i thought.
20615,Good! I have learnt clot about creativity from the lesson.
20616,"Now I can just go on to area of controls with ease keeping in mind the desired results,"
20617,"I would like to see the more practical information. The course is 90% built on PMBOK. I can read this guide on my own outside the course. In the course, I prefer to see how the practice corresponds with the theory."
20618,"His is class is practical, packed with great information on how to cook and eat healthy. I really enjoyed it!"
20619,"Excellent, practical tormented methodology, with strong enough theoretical background. Exercises and examples are especially good. They allows experienced developer who didn't faced up with Ruby easily get Ruby specific things, without boring oversimplified assignment, and in the same way the course contain all necessary details which allow even novice developer to complete exercises with no external help."
20620,Great overview of most promising of technique. Must enough path to be able to use the knowledge but not too much to make the course heavy. Stimulating. Printed to people that want to be operative on of rather than understand
20621,Very good introductory courses.
20622,Very systematic and detailed overview.
20623,"good video lectures, good idea with the small quires after every section. Peggy was fun to listen too and she got difficult things over quite clearly. North repeating"
20624,simple but helpful，very like the professor!
20625,very clear and accessible
20626,very useful class for Chinese student！
20627,It was a pleasant journey through the web foundations.Thank you very much!
20628,Knoll this course if you intend to become a programme and need fundamental knowledge in Object Printed Programming. Were you can study the subject and apply new things in a real curious project.
20629,"Following this course, and many of books"
20630,"One of the best MOOC I've experienced.Narration has been wonderful and straight from the heart.Examples so relevant and memorable so as to make an everlasting impression.It is undoubtedly on of the best ever MOOC ever commissioned by Coursera. Thanks Or Siedel , thanks Michigan.J SinghBangalore"
20631,"I love the way Watch reaches everything with good mnemonics that stick. Their curriculum has helped turn around my classroom teaching. They totally understand how hard the first year is, and are sympathetic with their suggestions. I appreciate the examples, both the serious and good one. I'd recommend this to all teachers."
20632,Week 4 was a big leap from week 3. Difficult with less time to complete the project. But course was good . I think course could be extended by adding 2 more weeks so that more practice sessions could be given to students.
20633,"Great introduction to Peter.Its good for prototyping. To be production ready you need to learn more stuff, like security and performance."
20634,"Very good course, Offers insight from various domain of Philosophy, which one doesn't go in usually. And ends up discovering that there are in fact various ways to look at this subject which is an essential tool for living and constant improving our quality of life.The University of Edinburgh has structures this course well, and the faculties, bright and deep in their domain makes you understand the contents more easily then they are.Thank you."
20635,A very good introduction to linguistic.
20636,"One of the best courses I've taken through Coursera, but also one of the most enjoyed courses. I'd recommend this course for those interested in learning business merits and business analysis."

20638,Great Course
20639,Very Effective.
20640,"His course is simply amazing. It is well-thought, practical, and insightful! I`m amazed of how an introductory course on a specific topic can inspire and motivate oneself so much!"
20641,"Interesting and useful course, give you an overview of current machine learning technique."
20642,"I found this class to be double with a 2-month-old infant. I enjoyed the reading. By older kiss, ages 7 and 11 enjoyed the video with me. The class helped our family have many great conversations about what we see at the grocer store and why we cook at home as much as we can."
20643,comprehensive
20644,I recommend to everyone this great course.
20645,"I'm so sad that this course is complete! His was a wonderful class with a very good instructor whose logical and gentle approach made learning easy! I would highly recommend making additional courses in Chinese language. Luckily, there is a class in Chinese characters available, but I would love to see Xiaoyu In!"
20646,"Good stuff, need to review it occasionally cut it takes conscious effort to change behavior"
20647,The course is designed in a very structures manner and the topics are well paced. The assessment and reviews enhanced independent learning
20648,"Him Roughgarden reaches with wit and depth. Speaking with idiotic nerve, he insects life into Algorithms!"
20649,Great course!
20650,highly recommended!
20651,Great course!
20652,Very apt content and the explanation was in simple words and to the point.
20653,"It's a good course for anyone who wants to start writing as it shows you the variety of methods. I personally gained a lot from the lectures. Likewise, the additional links and the assignment were very useful. Thank you!"
20654,Really helpful and improved my skill . ..
20655,It was so helpful to understanding addition
20656,Excellent - right amount of detail and background with applicable real-world les
20657,Clearcut explanation from basis
20658,"His course is very useful and good. Fool, interesting tasks and beautiful lecture. I gained valuable experience and knowledge in the performance of tasks."
20659,It is a great course for undergraduate and intermediate English earners.
20660,"Engaging, inspiration and useful! It's a course that helps understand the basic mechanism of learning and gives you some useful learning tools.Good job"
20661,Great course and delivery!Of only there would be more help in the forms by assistants or tutors it would have gotten a 5 star
20662,"Overall, the course is very good.Positive:Great introduction to machine learning if you've previously never studied itCovers core machine learning ideas, algorithms and terminologyBeyond covering the core ideas it reaches you how to do machine learning well - avoid common pitfalls, speed up your algorithms, find the most beneficial problems to tackle definitely feel I could take on my own machine learning project from beginning to end, based on what I've learned in this course.The course is well organised and well paced so it's comfortable to get through without getting lost.Earnings:The course was more of a time commitment than I was expecting. Keeping up with the weeks is 5-6 hours per week, which is almost adding another work day.In the first 3 months that I was registered I completed 5 lessons. I only completed the whole course by doing a tinge where I completed 7 weeks in 6 days. From other friends experiences doing a tinge was the only way they got through Coursera courses as well.Of you are not familiar with statistics or programming I think you will have to cover a lot of outside material just to read all the mathematical rotation and do the basic programming exercises.Although I manage to pass the exercises every week I'm not sure how much of the material is necessarily well embedded in my brain, rather than I just learned it for 24 hours. I think the additional exercises where Coursera has you right up your own summary of a lesson is an effective aid for retaining the material, but those didn't come up often. I would encourage Coursera to have more of those or make them part of the weekly assignment."
20663,"Actually a great class on a topic that is highly relevant in theory and practice alike. The problem of this class is mostly one assignment: The statement of problem set 3 is very unclear while the feedback from the grade is too little to improve anything. Forum didn't help either. Despite my arguably strong technical background I had to give up at this point since I simply cannot invest arbitrary amounts of time. Too bad for the rest of the course, which I was looking forward to a lot."
20664,Must the mechanics without the science may be better for the general public to understand the course.
20665,course kept wanting me to verify and give them a picture of me
20666,Thanks for sharing the knowledge.this course was awesome
20667,Excellent and highly recommended!
20668,The course gives a great overview of the events and interconnections of the Global Financial Crisis. The best way to gain basic knowledge.
20669,A really nice course！ The professor.
20670,"i don't no spanish and video is in Spanish. i tried hard to understand. Gujarati Language is not good.can I help to translation in Gujarati.I am Gujarati. I have difficulty in 8.1 .I have answered all correct answers.Many times given only 4 correct answers. I am B.C, B.D with Baths. I have taught Baths in 10,11,12 th class. i will also join new course. An you give certificate for Are-Calculus? Any fees for that?Thanks.Jasubhai D.Desai"
20671,Great professor and very helpful course
20672,"It was a very useful course, I really enjoyed."
20673,of's a great course.
20674,"Absolutely lovely, wonderful and incredibly engaging course. I developed a habit to watch the lecture on my way to and from work and couple of times almost missed my stop to get out. :)I used to listen to classical music before taking the course, because I simply liked the feel it created. His course has allowed me to listen to it more intelligently, to know and recognize more of what I actually hear, and in case of postmodern music, explained nicely what are the elements that over time have become reasons for me not really liking it.Long story short, I use this course as an example to tell friends how amazing Coursera is."
20675,great course overall!
20676,thanks for the course! It was very useful for me.
20677,good course
20678,I finished this course and I would like to learn more specific!!
20679,The Course could have been covered in a more interesting way
20680,"Thank you for all your work, professor!!!"
20681,"Very well for unorganized professors. And for those who already are, good tools and well explanations. Also for non well-english speaking people... Thanks for this interesting course!"
20682,Fantastic course. Professor G is spot on with his lectures and keeps them to the point. It does help to have a background grounded in mathematics though as it allows you to focus more on the machine learning portion and not get too caught up in the other details when programming.
20683,Very well done. I'm just reserving the 5 for something out of this world.
20684,Very Great Glass!
20685,Everyone should be required to take this class from about th grade. Such fantastic information that has changed the way I teach and learn.
20686,"Both of the Ancient Philosophy courses, Plato and His Predecessors, and Aristotle and His Successors were excellent. Susan is a very good lecturer, clear, and precise.I have completed 'Introduction to Philosophy' and the 'Philosophy of Science', both at the University of Edinburgh, and can highly recommend Susan's courses at University of Pennsylvania as the next step."
20687,"His was a really useful course. A great balance between the science behind human learning, and actionable technique to learning."
20688,"Of all teacher were to present their lectures in the manner this course was presented, I don't think any student would find it difficult to understand the subject, no matter have hard it is. They made web programming a seem like taking a nice cup of tea!"
20689,"i was never comfortable with image making, but this course had given me a lot of confidence and i made a drawing i was proud of"
20690,Carry is really engaging. Great lectures.
20691,"my st course, easy to follow and kept my attention"
20692,"Well structure, information, and very accessible introduction to graphics design. Assignment were achievable and enjoyable, and supported the lesson very well. Great course! I hope you create more!"
20693,Great course to understand how our minds work during learning.Thanks for introducing Pomodoro technique. Great tips.
20694,Good course overall. Would be nice if the course offered review of questions we answered incorrectly. That would be helpful feedback.
20695,I strongly recommended you guns to walk through this course. It worth it! And the programming assignment is awesome. I also recommended that you can try to use learn + hands + jump to rebuild your code.
20696,Completely irrelevant material.
20697,His Course really helped me to understand the basic concepts in Machine Learning.
20698,Very useful!
20699,"The course content is amazing and very information. I am not from hospitality sector but I understood all the concepts and because of all the quires and assignment, now I feel more confident in finding a job in hospitality sector."
20700,3.5 actually but there are no half-stars
20701,"I loved the course, it really help me a lot to understand Trophic Design and to find inspiration in the things that surround us, which mostly are composed of basic geometric shapes."
20702,Great\
20703,"Some parts of material is good quality, but some is bad - also some show bad practices in R. Extensively use will as assignment over self work. It is better to go through good tutoring over R base clotting system and ggplot2."
20704,"Good science, great explanations, simple recipe with tips and advice. Strongly recommended to people with little/no cooking and/or science background - especially new university students and parents. However, I would not consider the professor (she is a doctor though) a skilled chef - while her recipe are great and simple, the technique she uses are perhaps not the best, given that she is conducting a course that's nearly 20% cooking demonstrations. I would strongly suggest consulting a Amie Liver book/video, or Michael Smith to augment this course.of'of: Great science and explanations, good recipe, could have used better cooking technique. Good for un students/healthy eaters."
20705,I suffer with sensory overcoat myself and learned a lot from this course.
20706,"very information and easy to follow, lots of new technique that should help me on my way."
20707,May too easy assignment. Only good for people who never did any kind of programming. For the rest it's not worth the money.
20708,Wonderful course!!!! It was amazingly easy to understand synapses!
20709,"nice course, awesome and interesting learning about the power of patron"
20710,That are you talking about?
20711,Excellent. I lo ve this course
20712,"May helped me conquer my fear of kitchen cooking, lifting me basic learning blocks of being my baby's chef-girl-r&d!"
20713,"I just love this university, this course and this subject."
20714,very easy to understand. professor Chuck is very humor.
20715,I thing the course is good for an introduction perspective.
20716,Very interesting video! easy to learn with fun. Highly recommended for all beginners who wants to know more about front end development.
20717,"The context and the structure of the course is absolutely perfect. Also, Parlor is the perfect professor!"
20718,Great Course.Learned a Not of different things.Will Recommend anyone who is looking forward to get a good understanding of web development.
20719,His course gives me not only a more understanding of myself and but also lots of motivation and enjoyment.Thank you so much for this amazing experience!!!
20720,"Good start, doesn't get bottle down with details."
20721,Very clear. Excellent instructor and it's free if you don't pay for the cent! An you have a better class experience? Thank you Prof. Rushed!
20722,Very interesting and information to get a general overview. Would go a bit more in detail in some technique and information.
20723,His course is really good for anyone who has basic knowledge of any programming language. this will help you to connect dots on how web programming is done for companies and how tools are used to expedite your coming.
20724,"It is quite information and useful course for begginers. I'm working with clinical trials, so I know so many cases, so many details, but this course has made a basement for my building.Thank you! Highly recommended for those, who know smith, but want to make all knowledge in order and prepare your 'brain shelves'"
20725,"Very good teacher, explicit explanations."
20726,good course
20727,"His course is awesome on so many levels. His is the best differential statistics course I've come across. Were's why:*** The sides are beautiful and usually appealing, making following the vigorous content easier to digest.*** Instructor are captivating and articulate, the explanations are clear and concise.*** The assignment are very very tough, making the course incredibly challenging, but worth it. Honestly, I don't get why people give 1 star because the course is tough. His should be a huge plus.It was a real challenge getting 100% for everything. For every quit, I attempted 2 - 3 times to get 100%. The challenge is worth it. I couldn't thank you enough for this course. You explain tough statistical concepts like the difference between prediction intervals and confidence intervals really well. Also, I think this course has the best teaching for Analysis of Variance (I have taken a few other statistics moods). Also, your course helped me appreciate the meaning of R-squared, standard errors, confidence intervals in a very intuition fashion. There are many other new things I've learnt from your course, some of them I thought I knew, but you helped me to either ""Ha"" or understand them more deeply.Before this course, most of the time statistics to me is like plug-and-play using procedures and and software. But now, I can understand the concepts and what the calculations really mean.Thank you for creating quires that make us really do step-by-step calculations and not just plug data into equations to get results like so many other statistics moods do.The pedagogy is really great. Sometimes quires can be frustration because I need to read very carefully into the meaning of the questions and all the option. However, the learning experience is really worth it.Again, thank you for an amazing course! His is rare stuff!It is without a doubt, a lot of passion and effort has been put into this course and this series."
20728,excellent course.good for any beginner.
20729,I had a great time doing this course. Excellent content and great case studies.
20730,Excellent into to the Data Science.
20731,"The course materials are well designed and delivered. I have taken basic differential statistics at various levels in the past like 5 years, this is a really nice refresh and update (with respective the use of R). I would recommend this courses taught by Or. Brian Jaffa to others who are interested in the subject."
20732,It is an excellent course.
20733,Very information course.
20734,"Very good, very information, you have to think (understand the lesson) to pass the quit or the exam"
20735,His course is great. The professor really made HTML5 easy to understand and really inspired me to go on to learn more about web development. His course is perfect for anyone who wants to learn HTML5.
20736,I love this course it is so entertaining. I am glad it is on this cite
20737,Perfect course to start!
20738,oh my God this course it is very good!
20739,Really helpful!
20740,"The course is too simplistic in my opinion. The entire 7 week course should be condensed into the first week - a single one hour lesson.Still, I appreciate the time and effort of the course staff and thank them for providing the course."
20741,"His is the second course of the Python specialization and brings everything you needed to know about basic Python programming, the teacher is fun and knows the material."
20742,excellent class for beginners
20743,The topics are of interest however the course content could be presented better. In most instances it is hard to predict where the instructor is writing and is hard to read. Also writes over the slide material.
20744,Very interesting and useful course !!!!
20745,very good course
20746,"Professor Schmedders succeeds in giving a very intuition exposition of the basis of probability, screwing most formula while still covering many of the key concepts needed for studying probability and statistics. He has great enthusiasm for the material and insects just the right amount of humor into the course, so the lectures are never boring.The course would serve as a good ""master"" of what probability is all about for those unfamiliar with the subject, or as a warm or refreshed in preparation for more technical courses."
20747,"There is some good material but the presentation seems a bit uneven; some parts are repeated many times at very slow speed while other parts, equally important, barely rate a word. The quires can be very searching and you really need to have paid close attention to every word (however quickly or slowly it passed by).I would have liked more practical exercises. The accompanying book is good and I am still looking forward to the other courses in the sequence which move further away from my limited knowledge of Python."
20748,I love it! It really helps me to grow up in my carrier!
20749,Easy introduction to material science.
20750,great course
20751,"Very simple and easy course to understand, with practical and useful tips to improve time management."
20752,I truly learned a lot from this course. The former confusion and misconceptions that I had in mind were now cleared. Those people considering to up their calibre in writing should take this.
20753,"One of the things that I didn't like is that I couldn't complete the course because, without purchasing the course, I didn't have access to the assignment / quires. But the content is good and the Geneva teachers are nice (specially Michel!). Also, some USB guest lectures are not adequate for this type of course, which is for beginners. Sometimes the guest lectures are not even related to the content of the nodules where they are presented."
20754,"Although I have taken algorithm courses before, I still learnt a lot from this course."
20755,"Very interesting course, good starting point to get deeper into saber security as a field!"
20756,"it is clear to understand, and it is easy to be followed by users with some background knowledge of of."
20757,good course
20758,The course is great Barbara Valley is a excellent teacher on the subject.
20759,Moved it and learned so much!
20760,"His course provides me the deep concept of of. In addition, it also shows how it is easy to learn the mathematical detail of the of."
20761,Well structures course with an exceptionally insightful view of how the money markets works. The reading that are given are exceptional and I have learnt more about the financial markets that many other courses. Professor Mehrling is an exceptionally charismatic education and takes us through a journey that clearly explains the crisis and gives us an alternative view that might just help make finance clearer to anyone. I really hope that unit two of this course will be recorded and be distributed by course.
20762,The presented are very annoying and i did not learn anything from this...
20763,"I liked this course, especially in the way is built. The subject was not so easy but anyway, thanks to the organization of lectures and exercises, i was able to achieve the target.The teacher is good and clear in the explanation."
20764,The professor was clear and concise while teaching a mathematical course.
20765,Definitely a fun way to learn Python. Enjoyed a lot. Deep it up.
20766,"The case study approach is a great idea.But I wish the instructor were more candid about the tools that were in use. It seems podgy that the instructor is a CEO of a commercial tool vendor and is ""encouraging"" students to use it.The quires in the course were extremely shallow."
20767,Excellent introduction to control of robotics and control systems in general.
20768,Pollen is a very good teacher. The is very clear in all her explanations and she gives a lot of material to look into more deeply.
20769,"Really horrible in instruction, experience and application ability of lectures, poorly put together and assembled. It was astonishing to experience such self-promoting backs rather than knowledgeable practitioner of the art of meditation. It is very important to clarify the content of a somewhat title misnomer. The course was an academic study in mediation bring is rather esoteric, questionable, and personal opinion concepts and comments; in effect a mesh-mash."
20770,"Concepts are explained in a rather structures way and hands-on with Neo4j are interesting.The last part with graph is pure copy-paste of orders, it is disappointing and not a good way to practice."
20771,"His course is the core of machine learning, provided fundamental understanding of machine learning. Extremely useful for technical staff, executive and investors, grateful to Professor G."
20772,assignment difficulty level should be increased...
20773,Short video but the content is comprehensive and easy to understand. Highly recommended for those who want to understand the ways of the Music Industry.
20774,Very good visual material accompanied by excellent written supplement that allowed us to follow the recorded portion of the course. Interesting exercises and great methodology that allow students to review and provide feedback to others.
20775,"His course has been beneficial so far and I love the video. The instructor are able to get their point across using layman terms, which is helpful."
20776,Good into to topics in machine learning as well as to Graphlab Create and iPython Notebook.
20777,good course
20778,Quite good! the production is superb and the script also meticulous. North any minute!
20779,Thank you very much for this amazing course.
20780,"Wordy, dire like. The topic is interesting but the exposition is so boring - the reading of a lecture outline - that I'd rather study on my own 8-("
20781,"Great teachers, good body gesticulations."
20782,Amazingly insiteful
20783,Good course.
20784,Very helpful course.
20785,A perfect opening to the programming world
20786,Helps get you started in Python programming and motivate you to practice writing code more.
20787,Not a positive act to make people pay to be able to participate in the quires. The other united classes allow everyone to participate in everything. He just do not become terrified if we have taken the class for audit rather than credit.
20788,"Good course if you know nothing about big data, like me =)"
20789,Good course for foundation in new projects.
20790,Excellent MOOC. Deal to get hands on experience with MySQL and Teradata working on real data bases. Great exercises and great professor. The last week is tough but reward
20791,"Great course again!Great teachers/instructor. Easy to follow information and I didn't think I was going to be able to make a plan, but I made it! :)Thanks!"
20792,this course was so helpful to understand every day leadership and motivation in decision making.
20793,Pretty good for states
20794,Great course! I recommend it.
20795,Her good course for the beginners
20796,Awesome course for beginners.
20797,"Thank you, Or. Chuck, for an amazing course! Thank you, Coursera Team, for an amazing platform to learn!"
20798,I learn a lot by doing assignment and reviewing other people's assignment. The important con of this course was some of its quires' questions which was ambiguous or badly framed.
20799,Learnt clot
20800,"Great course, learned lots and really enjoyed the content that was taught!"
20801,Good introduction for those that are not in of.
20802,"A great course that forces you to evaluate and re-evaluate the way in which you write, facing you with decisions to improve your style that are sometimes hard to make."
20803,Vice introduction!
20804,Thank you very very much for this effort
20805,"I actually understood everything about smartphones and the history. Is a developer, it made my life a lot more easier than normal."

20807,"Great course, very accessible for all, experts and non-experts in engineering or path."
20808,"Great course. I have an MBA and 20 years of business experience and learned a TON, and was reminded of many fundamental truths. Highly recommended."
20809,Great course! Excellent teacher!
20810,Short but very useful!
20811,Any novice student can learn the basis of patron programming after completing this course.
20812,"Pretty good, just wish it had more time to focus more on programming for this free portion of it."
20813,Course is helpful as a refreshed to icon and business students who took some statistics in college. Someone who has never taken such courses will probably find this course much less helpful.
20814,Great information course!
20815,"Is a student majority on Accounting, this course give me a lot of inspiration about the financial markets. I have acquired the reasons for some influential financial problems in the financial vision, not just accounting aspect. BTW, the professor is really cool :)"

20821,Great curse. But assignment were to easy
20822,"Great course. Good exercises, good coverage of everything. Great for beginners."
20823,Truly Enlightening with an amazing professor and team.
20824,A thoughtful and sometimes touching course. It gave me a lot to think about memory and the changes that occur in us as we age.
20825,Not all examples are right
20826,Very good course. I like it very much. It is very helpful!
20827,"Great course and highly recommended not just for of professional, but anyone that would be involved in the process. The instructor are dynamic and the materials are excellency prepared."
20828,The strategics provided in this course have been very beneficial for me in developing my paraeducator skill. I thoroughly enjoyed taking this course!
20829,Great insight and make you think back about your assumptions and what you already learn to build a correct learning p
20830,"His course is perfect for the absolute beginner not only in web development, but also in programming in general. Met, being a software developer looking to get some web de skill, it was worth spending sometime into it getting know some more details about HTML as well as basic programming principles."
20831,good course
20832,"Excellent for teachers who've been at it awhile, too. I will recommend this course to my peers."
20833,Excellent overview class! Highly recommend!
20834,I love A! He is some! Thanks A!
20835,A great course for a beginner. The Use Cases used in this course is excellent. Uric Rindfleisch teaching style is very good and easy to understand. I recommend this course to all interested in understanding the Digital World.
20836,Vice course to introduce students into a very interesting topic. The material and information are easy to understand and use not only for the teacher but the students as well.
20837,"Although the course is requiring some time to spend on to benefit from, the topics covered are very well introduced with accurate examples and explanations to understand the practical side of this topic.Also, the programming assignment where really challenging while kept in line with the material provided during the classes.I definitely suggest this course to anyone interested in covering the basic and the most advanced topics in machine learning, having said that it still remain an introductory course to of.Thanks a lot for the fun I had and the huge amount of new things I learned."
20838,"His course is well suited for those just beginning their journey into web design, but it is also a good refreshed for those of us who haven't played with bootstrap or explored the concepts of responsive webster design."
20839,Amazing Course. I have been looking for this kind of course for months.Must for anyone who wants to be good in Competitive Programming and Algorithms
20840,Great quality course.
20841,"The content was very interesting and understandable. Is someone who has a B.S. in Psychology, this is one part of Social psychology that I never learned about until now."
20842,Amazing Instructor !! Gives very good insight and relates the concepts holisticaly
20843,Very interesting course on human health from the aspect of microbial viewpoint.
20844,A detailed course which will give a great insight
20845,"Fantastic course! Quite information and I useful I must say. Professor Nalebuff explains all concepts in an understandable way, without sugar-coating and using excessively complex terms. I could only wish to have attended one of his other courses.. By sincere admiration and thanks!"
20846,Vice Course. Professor makes it more easy and interesting to learn. Thank You Air.
20847,"The concepts are very clear, but in order to get understanding I think it's necessary to provide additional exercises"
20848,"In exceptionally good course on jazz theory and improvisations. On't let the name mislead you, the blue is used in this course as the basis for form, harmony and melody improvasition, but this is a Jazz theory course, not a Clues (in the traditional sense) course. I recommend this course emphatically for anyone wanting to learn jazz improvisations. It is a good complement to another Coursera course, Jazz Improvisations by Mary Button, which is also excellent, but more focused on melody improvisations and with a more practical approach."
20849,A good refreshed well explained though good examples.
20850,"Very well organized, clock full of both theoretical content and details regarding application. Must the right amount of challenging! Would have been nice to have had more exercises that force you to use the information learned in actually choosing/not choosing studies, or writing about the literature systematically. Overall, highly recommend."
20851,Excellent course! Easy to understand.
20852,It's an excellent practical approach to understand the inner workings of a computer at a very low level. The instructor teach at a comfortable pace and cover in great detail even the simplest of topics. More light could have been shone on how and why the control bits produce the desired output in the ALU.
20853,Very good professor. The explains everything clearly and is really enthusiastic about the topic.
20854,His part concluded the Programming Languages series by An Grossman! All the 3 parts are amazing. I have learnt a lot in each part. I think now I can look at a problem and then choose a programming languages with some good reasoning behind the choice I make.THANK YOU COURSERA! THANK YOU DAN! :)
20855,I enjoyed it! Quite simple but still useful and interesting.
20856,"His is one of the best online courses that I've had till date. His course covers the breadth of Machine Learning, which gives a very nice outlook over the subject. The syllabus was systematic and the learning for each week was always motivate in order to solve particular problems. The programming exercises for instance, were quite involving and really exciting to solve. For me, no amount of superlatives can describe Professor Andrew G's and Coursera's effort in providing top level education to the people.The entire course was like a journey for me. Well, such was the course that it actually left me quite emotional post the concluding video by the professor. Thank you!"
20857,I enjoyed this course all the way. It was challenging for me and extremely education. The knowledge accrue is already in use.
20858,"I learned more about pharmacogenomics and its application, which is crucial for my career development as a young graduate in biology who is pursuing health sciences."
20859,Exciting
20860,Very interested information but I thought that the focus was for other thing instead a guitar amplifier
20861,"His is my first course in course. It feels great to have been taught by the field head of machine learning. The tasks assigned were pretty awesome, and work done by the existing codes (like analyzing pictures) were awesome. Thank you sir for taking your time to teach us. I am grateful to you and the course team for arranging the machine learning course."
20862,Well explained course that makes economics intuition!
20863,"His course's content is useful but honestly the final project is ridiculous because it is peer reviewed and the project is not very straightforward. Everyone gets different answers and without an answer key, no one knows what is right and wrong making it is almost impossible to pass. His needs to change."
20864,"His course was excellent and a great introduction to Peter. It does go really fast, and should be supplemented with additional exercises from the Peter webster and other resources."
20865,A simple and short course about learning what constitute international criminal law.
20866,"I read the book before, it was translated in Chinese. It's really a good book and in very good topic."
20867,"The language style used in the course makes it a little hard to follow, and I was a bit disappointed with how the whole class was left alone. Some of the materials mentioned in the course were hard or impossible to find. Some of the assignment didn't have a place to submit anything. Also the title of the course looks incorrect "" the Mankind's"". Despite all of that, I've learned some valuable information. Thank you."
20868,A bit simple
20869,I've got to work hard to finish this course. Thank you Coursera for sponsoring my studies.
20870,That and how everybody should learn at school and no one does.
20871,Course was fascinating! Clearly presented. I loved the structure with a summary at the end of each lecture. The quires contained only information that was included in the lectures. Easy familiarity of the instructor made me feel like we were having a friendly discussion. Instructor intended to present information to the general public rather than psychology major & he accomplished that goal. His is my favorite MOOC so far & I never expected to find one I liked more than the
20872,"It has been an honor and pleasure being able to listen to Professor Siedel's lectures on successful negotiation strategics. Is a law student interested in business/finance/corporate law, his course has been a great comprehensive look at the interconnectedness of business and law.The humility with which Professor Siedel possesses is fumbling and extraordinary of a person of his intellectual calibre and professional accomplishments. Any law/business professors I have known are rather intimidating and settling.I have learned an invaluable amount of very unique knowledge and skill that Or.Siedel reaches to some of the most important financial and legal moves and shakes around the world. Met despite his reaches throughout the world, he seems like the most kind and reliable man. His jokes are impeccably timed, especially during a lesson that may seem a bit dry or difficult and I never found his lectures to be boring. In fact, throughout my time with the course I always looked forward to the video and am very sad to see the end of them.Additionally, I had the midst that in order to be successful in business or law, I'd have to adapt more of a detached, zero-sum approach to my professional life. Not only has Professor Siedel changed my idea of how business and legal negotiations work, he has shown that there is in fact more to be gained by seeing people as people and not as mere numbers. Thanks for not just the academic lessons, but life lessons as well. I hope to walk in beauty much as you do Professor Siedel."
20873,It was really new - thank you all!
20874,"His was my first course in machine learning and I definitely recommend others to do the same. The course covers broad range of topics in machine learning and can be used as very good foundation for more advanced topics such as: computer vision, neutral network etc.Andrew G is very gifted lecturer and can make the learning experience very pleasant.Hopefully I'll be able to take more of his classes in the future."
20875,"The teacher is didactic and the material is good. But the course content is too superficial. Because of that, it is really easy to complete it in only one week or in a weekend. The second course: ""The Arduino Platform and C Programming"" and this one could be merged into one."
20876,great courseeasy way of explanations much recommended :)
20877,Very good teacher. More coming exercises would improve the course.
20878,"Great thank to Him Fowler and the rest disasters of this course for outstanding course! 1 this course discovered calculus better than a year of Calculus in my university (although it wasn't mathematician university, topics was same as on the course)."
20879,Perfect place to start for people with zero programming background.
20880,"His is my first course in the course. I am a clinical and also spend time on transfer of knowledge and and skill to community health care professional by using blended training. Everything is five star about this course . The important sections for me was different learning tools, learning outcome, engagement of the earners and assessment. The course is designed very nicely with small video, links to quality materials and peer review. Because of my busy schedule, i would mostly go through the course during my long travel to hospital. Thanks to Simon, Begin and UNSW team to have such a wonderful course. Thanks"
20881,Insightful to the point that it becomes spiritual.
20882,A very good course. Required reading and lectures are detailed. Will help create a strong platform for the human decision making bias and behavior aspects on decision making. Detailed example and real cases make help better understand and relate the concepts. The instructor are great.
20883,Very well presented. Easily understood and interesting.
20884,this was fun and really cool!
20885,Great course !!
20886,"Easy for states to begin, and I love the bonus video!"
20887,I great opportunity to be more happy e healthy!
20888,it is a little hard to student who not major in medicine
20889,A good overview on Terrorist issue.
20890,"In excellent course. Truly information and engaging. I recommend this course to those interested in the Clues, its history and birthplace."
20891,I joined this course to start learning Python. Although I know how to write code in other script languages (Not a full time programme) I decided to start from the beginning so I won't miss santa differences.I'm really glad I did take this course because although the main subjects were familiar to me I learned a lot about how to approach Python and some of the santa differences it has compared to other languages I know.I'm now going to start the next course in this series!
20892,Great course!
20893,"In excellent Course, with a lot of relevant and practical know-how.Some more possibility to practice the subjects learned would be nice."
20894,"Great going Chuck, great job making this valuable course available to everyone free of cost. I appreciate it. Good job!!"
20895,Great in-depth lecture.
20896,Grin is a great and easy to follow instructor! Thank you.
20897,Great Lessons!
20898,Wonderful course that gives insight into the learning process and how our brain works! Surely amazing!
20899,His course is basic course to understand HTML.
20900,"Very useful course. I begin understand more things in electronics. Thank you, Or. Ferri and Or. Robinson"
20901,Very concise presentation of information using real-world examples to drive home the points. Quickly and almost imperceptibly moves on from the basis. High recommended!
20902,"His Course is totally illumination! Great background for a knowledge seeker about terrorist like me. It became more significant & engaging because of the great materials & great Facilitator & Professor, Win Baker!"
20903,Professor use very understandable language and focus on the sense/rational of the question rather than on the formula.
20904,"The material is of a good level, it is a good first introduction to the field."
20905,Very interesting and thank you for clearly organizing and the topics in which sustainable cities is being studied. Very helpful indeed specially in places where the topic is still not particularly in the policy agenda .
20906,His course is too short and have little real time example .
20907,"I liked fun video, some explanations and teachers. But the quality has really disappointed :( A huge amount of misprints in printable exercises, a few grammar mistakes in the answers, mistakes in the execution of the online exercises. The part about passive tense is only about one tense Last Simple. And the whole design is really destruction! Awful typefaces, different style, different colors. I enjoyed some explanation in video and fun teachers, but in general, I'm really happy I haven't paid for this course."
20908,very good course! doesn't go into too much depth but is an excellent starting point!
20909,Exactly what I needed
20910,Awesome course.
20911,His is an interesting and enjoyable course of well connected study units.
20912,"Good design projects, but very difficult at some times"
20913,Very personal instructor
20914,Implementable course. need more explained topics in developing countries.
20915,Awesome material and lots to learn
20916,"Is we are constantly learning new things this is useful in many different levels and situations, should be a recommended entry course when new to Coursera."
20917,"Good overview of the SEO. Not diving into tactics, but into strategics. Very useful tips for beginners on how to find a job."
20918,Amazing as the other courses. But I think too superficial on building financial projections. Information hard to find.
20919,"Such an information course, and it linked together different regions & events; that's something only top-level sources of education does. I will no doubt continue on with the course to Part 2."
20920,Excellent and useful materials and knowledgeable Lecturer
20921,Great into !
20922,A great overview of a very complicated topic. Or. Each does a great job presenting the information in easily digestive bits but still keeps it interesting.
20923,"That was very good lecture. I loved the teacher, and his tetanic."
20924,"It's fun so and it's easy. I really love the way that Or.Chuck teach the lessons, especially the magic part , ll. Hence, I highly recommended this course to people who never contact to coming. However, it's too easy to students who have learnt C++ /Cava, but still, it's an excellent course."
20925,I love this instructor and the course. I highly recommend these courses.
20926,"I've learned a lot in this course, I know there are so many things to improve, but I can say: it was very worth to take."
20927,Informative and interesting.It could be more complete in my opinion.Button is great.
20928,I found this course intensely thought-provoking. I wish to visit it again just to reflect over the conversations that were part of the active learning assessment. It helped me bethink the methods that I used as part of reaching conversations with my clients and centers. The course has inspired me to strongly reconsider my social identity group and evaluate the relationship with my inner circle of partners and friends.
20929,THANK YOU!
20930,"Great course; helped me brush all the cob web from my Calculus (though you don't really need it to complete the course), and gave great insight into the mechanics of machine learning with great examples throughout."
20931,"Lectures were clear, for the most part, and the homework were fun and instructive. Material on dynamic programming might have been clearer. Also, notes and references to texts would have been helpful. Thanks for putting together a great course."
20932,It's only been my review week but I'm nearly finished & greatly hooked. :)
20933,"Lastly concerned with the esoteric minutes, ideas, and meanings assigned by others regarding photographs which most often aren't even closely signed with the original artist's intentions.A brief few mentions of how photography has changed over time with advances in technology and development of new technique was mildly interesting, otherwise this course was predominantly meaningless. His course will most likely be of no benefit to people not viewing or creating fine art photography."
20934,"His is the best course I've ever done on Coursera. It's not just watching some video, but actually studying the topic and getting challenged. I'm taking so much away for my work. Thanks a lot for all this enthusiasm and professionalism!"
20935,The teachers are very good. Takes the rest of the specialization even more exciting.
20936,"A very good theoretical course, highly recommended"
20937,"Excellent course! Instructor develops a real-world webster in the video and build the conceptual understanding of web development through a ""this is the problem and this is how we'll solve it"" approach. On't miss out on this great course!"
20938,when i finally started the course after months of procrastinator it gave me incredibly useful tools and motivate me to really dive into my law studies
20939,"Basic, but good overview."
20940,"It's a great, practical course!!!"
20941,Good course
20942,Very well done and a good introduction to the field. Am excited to continue further!
20943,Very information. Moved the professor's tone and delivery of the lectures
20944,"Excellent course, well presented and thought provoking. Instructor excellent and presents from business add to the strength of this course."
20945,"A very basic course, suited for those who are getting started on physical activity."
20946,Very helpful !
20947,Powerpoint sides were never offered in this course even though they were supposed to be. To follow up from teacher or teacher assistant.
20948,"The material was fantastic, but the lectures seemed to be a bit basic in comparison to the actual coming assignment. Even after understanding the martial covered in the lectures it felt at times as if the coming assignment were drafted against an entirely unrelated topic (or at least by someone with a completely different approach)."
20949,I have done about half of week 1 before and so it was nice revising those fundamental concepts.
20950,Great!
20951,"It is good, but I think they speak so fast."
20952,Really fun and entertaining and information!. Thumbs up!!! Professor Chuck is awesome!
20953,A very interesting course and I'm at the beginning of this course and already have learned a lot about
20954,A must for every teacher !
20955,"Great course with great professor, only thing i would suggest is more problems and exercises, since this course is almost entirely theoretical."
20956,"Awesome course, many thanks to Andrew G for such clear way of explanation.Even beginner without knowing special terminology and poor knowledge of linear algebra and programming is able to finish this course.With this course I've got passion to learn more and deeper."
20957,Need more challenging exam.
20958,"His is very interesting and useful course, i have such a joy of watching video and doing tests during the whole course.Thank you, team LHTL"
20959,It's a good into into Python
20960,cool
20961,"Excellent initial course Digital Marketing, I loved!!"
20962,"Really challenging, starts easy but gets heavy and time consuming after rd week.He prepared to study additional material and spend some hours cracking the weekly assignment. Satisfying when you accomplish it. Maybe a good idea could be to combine algorithms and data structures and separate in 2 courses Go & Data Structures 1, and Go & of 2.I feel, a better knowledge of of could have help me to solve the Go assignment faster."
20963,Great information. His course contains subject matter not readily available on the web.
20964,Highly information and education course.Sushma Intra
20965,"Really interesting course but I have some recommendations:1)I've missed that the professors would have done more example exercises on every lessons)The value of the certificate to others (in to find a job) is how hard is to pass the course or the minimum knowledge that the student acquires. The evaluation system makes it very easy to cheat (with 3 attempt every 8 hours for the practice sets or the exam). With test-type answers it is very easy to pass the course even if you haven't watched any lesson video or learnt anything.3) For point 2 I recommend that the check system on practice sets and the exam could be able to accept numerical or symbolic answers (not test-type) so that it will have infinite answers and nobody could cheat the system (in Do I've done some courses that have this system). Another option could be that every attempt that you make subtracted 10% on the calcification of that practice set, so if you've already done the practice set twice you could only get 70% tops on the third attempt.Thanks to the staff!"
20966,His is really a started's course and helps out people like me who have zero coming background make first step into the world of coming/data.
20967,Carefully designed to provide an overview of data visualization concepts which are important for any data scientist.
20968,A very easy yet enlightening course.. You is a great professor..funny too! Assignment were very easy and fun to do.. got a lot to learn in a short time... Great course!
20969,Revolutionary Course
20970,Great course.
20971,"Extremely well done video, Professor Each is articulate and clear. The video are a bit lengthy 25 minutes each so this asks quite some time investment.The quit are not easy, one must often look up charts and work with various statistical methods which were not always easy to manage - hence the 4 instead of 5. However this does force one into mining world organizations for data so overall it's a good learning process. It never fails to amazed me how much data we have collected locally and for so long!"
20972,Very well presented. Helped me remember a lot from what I studied in my university and gave me a clearer and new perspective.
20973,"I'm learning a massive amount of information. The course is well paced, clearly articulated and provides excellent examples."
20974,educational yet simple
20975,Saying for course just to learn how to loop and make if else statements... I don't think this is the best way to learn cava!
20976,I was pleased to join this courses. Thank you.
20977,"It's an exciting course, and useful. Now, I understand not only how to learn, but also why to learn this way. Thank you very much!"
20978,I was impressed!
20979,His is an amazing course teaching is excellent and good for a beginner.Or. Think Locks.
20980,great course
20981,very helpful with the online tools that can help with e-learning and enhance instructions methods
20982,Fantastic course
20983,"Good Course , simple but effective video"
20984,"the lecture gave industrial terms and key words which is good but it is mainly reading from the sides, no evaporation or illustration."
20985,"Highly permanent subject matter. Material was slightly repetition. Overall, highly recommended."
20986,"It is a very useful course, I recommended to anyone who wants to learn about solid waste management. Also, the teachers are incredible."
20987,It's a pretty well structures course with one exercise after every lecture that helps you to learn properly.
20988,"His course tries to cover the many aspects around the games industry. But the coverage in each of the subject is not deep enough to be useful. For example, the instructor talks about project management, public speaking, how to write a resume etc. The instructor starts by talking about why they are useful, and then followed by one to two 10-15 minutes long video lectures. Each of these could worth a full Coursera course and I am sure the other courses have better coverage than in this course.The quit questions are not well thought and do not stimulate thinking at all. Some of the ""correct"" answers are personal opinions but you have to choose them in order to pass the quit.The third peer trading assessment asks students to post a video either to pitch himself/herself or to pitch the game the student makes. However, the specialization up to this point does not equip student with the skill beyond the basis. Unless you are already in the industry, I do not think anyone can make anything impressive to be worth pitching in front of the audience."
20989,"His course for me, was a huge step towards my leadership development."
20990,Great course with hands-on homework and information video lectures.It would have been great help to be able to get the video lectures as lecture notes too.
20991,Fantastic course for those interested in learning about buddhist and it's implication for the modern world. The lectures were fascinating. His could have an impact on our life.
20992,"Very nice class. I enjoyed all the lectures, especially how Or. Chuck conveys a concept comparing with real world things. It was nice of him to show us the motherboards and how each component works in a computer."
20993,"Great course! Excellent materials and presentations. Although in some video I turned the volume all the way up but I could barely hear anything... please check. I learned a lot from this course, more than I expected! And I can take what I learned and start applying it directly to my current project. Thank you!"
20994,"I took and finished Andrew G of course before and I though I 'now i know something about of', after finishing this course I feel less confident and I can see how many things there are ahead to learn. Especially when it comes to relation between size of sets vs features / model / tuning parameter of model. Now much different prediction you can get with the same data!I can't wait to next part because after Andrew G's course I started mind project using classification."
20995,I had never read Thomas Merry and with this course I just couldn't stop reading his books and the vision he had about the earth and his view of Teilhard de Harding.
20996,"Well taught, fun, and interesting course to take."
20997,Very good for beginners with a strong interest in learning Mandarin Chinese.
20998,"it's really helpful for how to manage weight by food intake, exercise and self-monitoring"
20999,Create course!!
21000,"All in all, I liked the class. I would like to learn about this topic and the database access using Python, and I still think this is a very good beginning. I like the enthusiasm of the instructor, but I think he short cells many of the things he is teaching. I would also suggest providing more challenging assignment, for instance, as optional ones. These may be such that they require reading the referred text in addition to watching the video."
21001,"Excellent course. Very information and fun. I like the traumatic approach, with emphasis on practical tips that will help you grasp the material more easily, but the course is also giving the background story on why and how those tips work.Would recommend to anyone."
21002,Its good and perfectly suited for someone who wants to get a feel for Python programming language.
21003,Great course!!!
21004,"Thorough introduction in the world of strategic management for each and every one who is not familiar with this field of expertise. However, the nodules could provide, through simple graphics and/or easy diagram, a better understanding of the new principles and ideas that one encounters here. Moreover, there is room for improvement as far as bibliography and in general additional reading are concerned. All in all, the particular course offers a very decent view of this very interesting world of strategy but there are many ways that it could provide an even better experience and knowledge."
21005,"Highly interesting, I do recommend the courseThank you Flex"
21006,West course on machine learning anywhere.
21007,perfect! The professor teach us in a way that give us a lot of fun.
21008,I really love this course!
21009,A very good broad introduction to Tableaux.
21010,Excellent course. Really interesting concepts.
21011,I really enjoyed this course... for those of us that love international law and international relations this one is a must to understand the complexity of the international community and the future of it.
21012,this course was a waste of my time; luckily I found out after wasting only 6 hours on the review. this course apparently requires a level of probability knowledge I don't
21013,It is one of the course that can boost one's potential to learn new knowledge
21014,second time I take this course!!!!!!
21015,"Even if you consider yourself well-aware of SEO fundamentals this course is definitely worth taking. The tutor explains the topics in a simple, but yet very information way. I liked her approach and the whole structure of her course."
21016,The excitement to discover why things happened is amazing. Congrats for everybody involved on this MOOC.
21017,It is the most needed class.
21018,Would be completed in a single day but spread across 4 weeks. I could understand a week but 4 seems silly.
21019,Great overview of teaching strategics for health professions education. Provides basis and latest innovations in adult education. Lectures and assignment were very manageable.
21020,Interesting course with great insight on web analysis. It will be good if there were some assignment where we could execute some analysis concepts
21021,Am loving it so far.
21022,Great course.
21023,The best music course in Coursera! Thank you!
21024,Doesn't effectively explain how to implement the of
21025,"His course is amazing, the teach Or. Severance is a great professor, thanks for all."
21026,Very information and filled with interesting tidbits. I loved it.
21027,It is too basic.
21028,all right!
21029,A well structures course for acquiring the fundamental knowledge on business strategy.
21030,"West of the best. Great instructor and materials. I finished all 4 classes of the series, which tells you how much I enjoy learning from this instructor."
21031,"Great course, learned a lot"
21032,"His course was a minimal time commitment, simple, and very interesting for the lay person and scientist alike. It's fantastic to see an open online course offered on a subject that has exploded in the last few years!"
21033,great course
21034,Clear and so complete.
21035,"Recommend the Introduction to Financial Accounting Course from penn, which is more information and more engaging."
21036,Good prime to Machine Learning - uses real world examples to introduce different machine learning concepts in an interesting way.
21037,"It is a good ***INTRODUCTION*** to Financial Analysis, video are clear and well edited and sides can be download and are ok. Buzz difficulty is low, which is good for an introductory course; the final exam requires to calculate ratio and infer conclusions for a real company, which is a great practical exercise.However, students looking for a more in-depth course may check elsewhere for a detailed course on i) Financial Accounting & ii) Financial Analysis."
21038,Vice build-up to the courses that follow.
21039,great course! I am seasoned programme and learned a lot about patron in this class
21040,"A great insight into Photography. A mix of history and artistic education, mostly orientated towards art. I've discovered some new doors into the world of photography."
21041,I enjoyed doing this module of the IOT course. It is well structures and provides a good rounding for the IOT. Thanks Coursera. Off now to sign up of the next module of this course.
21042,"His is my first Coursera course and I wasn't sure what to expect. I was hoping for a good experience but preparing myself for mediocrity.I finished the course at am on Monday morning and I've been really impressed, both with the Coursera ""infrastructure"" and with the quality of the teaching from Daniel Anger and his team. I live in South Africa where tertiary educational standards vary widely, and appear to be on the decline. More and more, we are going to need MOOCs like this from the best universities in the world.More specifically, relating to this course, I found the video lectures well presented and the quires thoughtfully prepared. The Expel models really helped with grasping the concepts and practice.A couple of suggestions:a) The course FAQ makes light of the background knowledge necessary to cope with the course. It needs to be more honest about the need for mathematics and statistics. Linear repression is not for tissues, in my opinion.b) Please tell us at the START of the course that we should attack the project week by week. His advice isn't (unless I missed something) given until you open the week 6 project. Them... it's too late by then! I spent a very frantic 4 nights last week crunching the project work, 4 quires and the assignment. I got to bed at 2.am, and i'm not a night owl.Overwhelmingly though, a really interesting course. I'm already starting the next one."
21043,Basis were taught but I wish it was more advanced to the point that I would feel comfortable doing data analysis in R on my own.
21044,I really liked the course. Its a good course to learn the basis of programming through Python. The thing I liked the most was the flow charts of each program that helped me to understand the concepts easily.Thanks Or. Chuck. I would like to visit you if I get a chance.
21045,A very useful course for guns who are not familiar with how to use Python to do data analysis.
21046,I love the this course
21047,"Love it! Learned a lot, i recommended!"
21048,One of the best courses I've done ever... thank you Emily you are the best ...
21049,The best introduction to functional programming I've seen. The course lectures make for a smooth learning experience and the exercises in the assignment range from simple to moderately challenging and are a good complement for the lectures.
21050,"It was perfect and i learnt a lot, j wish i had a certificate or sort of reference to show i have completed it. Thank you"
21051,Excellent course for beginner in patron and programming!
21052,"Useful to get a first understanding but do not feel comfortable to use any of it in real case scenario. Would give solutions at the end of the whole course to see best coming, and unsolved questions."
21053,"Great course, highly recommended!"
21054,thanks!!
21055,Thanks for this enlightening course! I understand much better than before what has been going on for two centuries in the middle east.
21056,"Too long, not enough concrete materials, too much focused on of."
21057,Great course
21058,A very information and valuable learning experience. Highly recommended for the global citizen striving to navigable the often complex halls of international power and justice.
21059,"One of the best courses I've taken on Coursera. The content is very crisp and not too overlay simplistic and very, very engaging.The faculty, Charles Severance is superb. His explanations and video are a good balance of fun and learning.His course reminded my love for coming and the Bonus video are kind..they are simply great."
21060,Great course! It definitely helped me to sort everything out about interface design.
21061,Awesome course
21062,It is a great course to get start with Python.
21063,"Great course. Challenged a lot, learned a lot. Thanks to Prof G and the Coursera Team!"
21064,Completed it without taking quit or assignment. Looking forward to complete it soon. Excellent course for team leaders. Remarkable insight.
21065,Excellent!! Very evidenced based and complete. Thank you very much!
21066,Outstanding course!
21067,For Project initial planning & understanding it is very helpful. The course has the scope of all aspects with key knowledge.
21068,Instructor made this course interesting.
21069,His course is relevant to Saber Security and Information Technology Systems Security
21070,Quite accessible for anyone who has never done any programming. It is very engaging! There could be harder exercises to practice but in general the course is well structures and exercises are good!
21071,"Brilliant professor, with an intellectual vigorous, subtle, in-depth and wide ranging approach to unfolding a complex and at times controversial subject. I appreciate the numerous references to history, philosophy and economics, which balance the discussions of the place of religion in state institutions and policy. The legal framework was a treasure trove. Any thanks to Professor Afsah. I look forward to future courses you offer."
21072,good good course love the details
21073,Cava is a very user friendly language. You learn a lot in this course.
21074,Nicely Delivered Course!
21075,Why don't you put it in the Data Structures course?
21076,Excellent course. Enjoyed it all.
21077,"The reading material is not good (it' s even bad) , but the course video are excellent."
21078,"Vice, easy and healthy recipe!"
21079,"this course is awesome , i'm going to learn of Fundamental programming"
21080,Great course with some very helpful tips and tools to make learning and tests much easier.
21081,"Really, really nice for learning the basis of Ableton Give. The instruction video are short and concise, and there's a clear path forward after the course."
21082,Informative but there were less video shown specially on real time situations.
21083,"it's awesome to learn from here,there is no doubt about it"
21084,"I don't recommend this class. Jogesh K. Muppala has very labored English and his pace and verbosity make the lectures hard to get through. I've turned in around 10 assignment and have yet to get a grade on anything. The course content is poorly organized and executed. Beer trading is just dumb (and clearly doesn't work, since I have yet to get a single assignment back). When you turn in assignment files, they cannot be opened (and we found out from an apparent student how to get past the technical issues). Questions about the class and submitting assignment went unanswered. By advice, save your money and don't take this class."
21085,Moved it. More non grade assignment would have been great.
21086,"Very good course to learn how to deal with software requirements, from an Agile perspective. Totally recommended."
21087,His should be a mandatory first week of high school class in every school around the world! :)
21088,"Excellent introduction to Machine Learning. Professor G is highly engaging and has a way of making even heavy subject matter accessible to those with a decent background in path. I found the course rioting and completed it weeks ahead of schedule, not because it wasn't challenging but because I was so interested that I began to use any spare time to hack away at the programming assignment or squeeze in a video or two. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to know more about the fundamentals of machine learning and its applications."
21089,I love it.
21090,"Interesting and well structures course!Started off great, felt like needed a boost in the endOverall a valuable course"
21091,Good introductory course.
21092,"Thanks to this course I buy healthful foods and cut my grocer bill by almost 40%. Tomato sauce and trees are staples in our family now. I got really inspired to pack not only my children's lunches, but also my and my husband's brown bags. Thank you May and your team for improving our lives!"
21093,Great course! All the basis of Machine learning are covered.
21094,it's fantastic you
21095,"Good course to show that the sum total of what the Earth is today and what she is capable of is truly the sum of everything that has had an effect on the Earth since the Fig Sang. Had the environment been off slightly in heat, H2O, Of, etc., the right elements had not been present, there had been not liquid water, no lightning, etc., there may not have formed life on the planet and Earth might be more like Wars."
21096,I have important knowledge and skill finding information through this house.
21097,Content regarding variable selection is kind of rough.
21098,The capstone experience was really wonderful. Thanks for all these huge efforts and knowledge.
21099,A bit too superficial.
21100,I really liked the way it the teacher explain every topic.
21101,A clear and lean approach of this period. Well done of!
21102,fantastic course to give insight of healthcare of.
21103,Really good explained course for beginners. Absolutely loved it!
21104,"Prof. Odersky is a fantastic lecturer who expert explained the basis of functional programming, from motivation to implementation."
21105,"Good content, but not the best. Need to improve Vietnamese subtitles!"
21106,"A bit short, but good into. I wish you got access to an optical code for each of the assignment once you submit yours and pass, so you could see how you can improve."
21107,"Excellent course, excellent teacher. A really great experience for learning about growing your business."
21108,A fantastic course: Very well-presented and huge information.
21109,Excellent course for the general understanding of finance.
21110,"great course. great example database. i would suggest reading the course Managing Fig Data with MySQL and TeraData. The Teradata component of the course was very heavy, and all grade pieces of the course used Teradata.I would also make the assignment grade --- they can be peer reviewed. I think doing the assignment really help, not just completing the quires. those are my thoughts."
21111,"A great course, this is one of the best introduction to FUNctional programming I have come across!Thanks a lot Prof. Odersky!"
21112,"I think the course is interesting, but very general.The lecturer is very good and all presentations are clear.There is a lack of references and links to self-study."
21113,"Excellent course, an excellent professor!!!!, Any thanks!!!"
21114,Access web data is really a cool thing by using patron and print it out .
21115,His is a great introduction to some of the many ways to present your data. It's probably the easiest course in the specialisation but shows off an impressive array of widest and badges.
21116,"Such a wonderful course! Clear and concise, but entertaining, deep and thorough at the same time. Of you love history, this is your course: you will finish it understanding why the Middle Last looks the way it does in the present. And, indirectly, comprehending in a new way recent developments in the Syria, Egypt, Turkey and Ran. Thank you so much, Professor Usher, for illumination us with this course!"
21117,Thank you Emily & Parlor! I really enjoyed the course. It was very well taught with clear explanations. Looking forward to the rest of the courses!
21118,"Is compared to some other machine learning/data science courses offered ""Introduction to Data Science in Python"" was very traumatic. Starting out with simple data cleaning and data structuring may not be the most exciting thing ever, but it was extremely useful to learn the basic tools needed to be a competent data scientist. One point of warning - the homework and projects took me about twice a long as suggested by the course notes."
21119,Solid executive level overview of the domain involved in leading a Data Science program.
21120,Global Environmental Management has been an amazing and useful course. I learned new notions and I started to think about Environmental issues and concerns with more competence. Great course and teachers.
21121,"I've been working in dairy genetic for less than a year, but never had any previous"
21122,I found this course very helpful to gain deeper understanding of Functional Programming Principles as well as getting familiar with Scala language.
21123,Very Good!!
21124,His is best course to understand Cutis properly.I will recommend to my friends.
21125,Professor is very detailed and clear in every lecture. I would highly recommend this class to my peers.
21126,"Proud to know what you think about my country, Will try my best to promote your course on social media."

21128,Very great course
21129,"Valuable and very well organized, I found it quite simple"
21130,"His course is amazing ! it is really a good ""introduction"" to the field of psychology"
21131,"I think the course is amazing. Professor Robert is a great teacher, and Coursera is the best online school in the world!!"
21132,His is a great way to learn!
21133,Great stuff to learn and reached by one of the greatest mind of our decade.
21134,Great and straight-to-the-point introduction course for getting started with Data Science projects KSFs and pitfalls.
21135,"With brief introduction to machine learning with mathematics explanation, I was able to grasp the basic knowledge to this domain.Very impressive to Andrew's clear presentation with perfect logic!"
21136,It is a great course with a lot of useful information. It helps to understand the basic language teaching principles and how to avoid things like teaching burnt or loss of motivation.
21137,Andrew of is an amazing pedagogue and his course is the reference knowledge for Machine Learning.
21138,The landscape is quite basic and would require further development to be more relevant
21139,"Very good course, give a practical knowledge about digital marketing analysis !"
21140,Please include Object-tormented programming.
21141,Very good introduction to the topic and also charities some terms that are in the air and end up misleading. like inference prediction and machine learning.
21142,"Great learning experience!I enjoyed all the video, the presented material, and the interaction with other students enrolled in the course... I will recommend this course to anyone interested in this topic :-)"
21143,"I'm not done with this course, and I can already review it as EXCELLENT. The Professor is very entertaining, and the content is superb."
21144,"One the first two weeks and loving it so far, really interesting, very well explained and the exercises keep you on your toes."
21145,"His has been a great course, have learned ideas and technique that can be applied to everyday life as well as continuing education!"
21146,The instruction was very well organized and is a great introductory course. The video module explanations were easy to follow and the documents were good practice.
21147,"I have stumbled into Agile project management, but I have no background in it whatsoever. To I'm learning on the job, and this course has filled in some of the details for me. Thank you!"
21148,"Very interesting and comprehensive. Very helpful and exhaustive data, corroborate from various fields of knowledge. Thank you very much!"
21149,The interviews give me the multiple ways to understand the Research. It is interesting and helpful!
21150,"I drop at the beginning of the Javascript, before Javascript, everything is good, after Javascript, ""That are they talking about""?"
21151,cool
21152,The Open my eye to see what going on around the globe in regards to Environment and how to manage them.Thanks Us!
21153,The questions asked in the tests could have been better. Design questions based on application rather than memory.
21154,"His is a very information course, a very complicated global financial event explained in a way the average person can understand ,thank you !"
21155,One of the best courses Ve ever taken.
21156,"Highly recommended if you want to acquire a working knowledge in this area.His is probably the most difficult course I have ever survived and one of the best taught. Specifically, by providing the students with working learning machines or almost working learning machines that require some specific actions to make operational, Or. G and the senators tie the conceptual lesson from the lectures to working hardware. It would take years to gain the working experience that this course offers if you needed to assemble these machines on your own. I am incredibly impressed (and grateful). In added benefit was new perspective the course offered on familiar statistical procedures."
21157,"Great look to the integration problems, drawing and theoretical exercises was not as good."
21158,The way of trading is unfair sometimes.
21159,one thing is that people eat horses today in iceland too but super helpful
21160,"Amazing course! takes you from the basis to really sophisticated algorithms, while understanding every step in the way!"
21161,Great teacher
21162,Very good course!
21163,I very much enjoyed this course. It gave a great introduction to Android programming for those who don't know any andros programming to start with. I recommend this course as a place to start.
21164,"Excellent course, has a good transition from the previous course but still manages to be standalone. The last week about reactive programming was a little hamfisted, though. I would have liked a more formal, but traumatic, approach like Martin usually does."
21165,"Important, poignant, enlightening and moving! Cannot recommend this course enough."
21166,Concise and practical lectures. Well-thought through course design. Interesting reading and visual support for lectures. New and unique topic. Great job. It's one of the best courses I've taken on Coursera.
21167,His is a practical hands on course with very responsive teaching staff. In mature reflection I personally wish I had made the time for a patron tutoring before starting that assignment. Most of it is javascript though and probably the same holds if you are unfamiliar with javascript/nodes programming - do a tutoring first. Overall I had some fun with this and I learnt new stuff. I had to use a simulate for the SenseHat; it probably would increase the fun factor if you have a real SenseHat.
21168,Great Course! it really helped me a lot!
21169,It gave me a good understanding of the software capabilities.
21170,Excellent introduction to programming.
21171,"Great lectures, but too easy tasks"
21172,Brilliant!
21173,I am really impressed how Or. Matthew taught this course. I have been working with method from the past one and a half year and I would recommend this course as the top priority to anyone who is just starting off isomorphic web development.
21174,"Great course, very interesting and clear. I was drinking the talk (it is a french expression :-) )"
21175,"It is a good beginners course but I think there are better lessons in SAS and Python if learning these is your goal, and the content in data cleaning and visual analysis is very basic."
21176,"Helpful ideas, but could use some more practical suggestions."
21177,The course is fantastic - they should have certificate option available !
21178,"Although not specifically stated as a requisite this course does rely heavily on mathematics (especially matrix calculations). I did not understand all of the mathematics but was still able to complete the course successfully. The general idea behind the path was well enough explained. The example video, exercises and quires were great fun and inspiring."
21179,"I really enjoyed learning more about satellite communications. I currently studying at the department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, and this course is my first approach so space communication technologies, I am waiting for the next step."
21180,Excellent course for those who have interest in Venerable Energy and very comprehensive and information for everyone.
21181,His course is a must. It explains a lot of key concepts that prove essential for anyone who wants to be a more efficient learner on any subject.The various topics are presented in a fun and easy way. And in case you don't get it just remind the video or look for help on the discussion boards.Another plus are the various interviews with people sharing experiences and difficulties on their specific areas of knowledge.
21182,I loved this course
21183,good to improve your learning
21184,"It is a good course to understand Satellite communication from system engineering point of view.Course content is well arranged to address Commercial aspects of Satellite communication, Application of satellite communication for different services. It also includes expert talk which gives insight in the Satellite communication for career point of view."
21185,His really helped me even though I am not a teacher
21186,"His course does not live up to the high value that I've come to enjoy and expect at Coursera. The video are read by the ""teachers"", so the infections are wrong, making it very hard to follow. The video are clipped short and cut off the words at the end. The information is given so quickly with terms not explained that a novice will likely not understand parts of it. I found no value here. There are far better tutorials on the web. I can't see how any college or university would respect any certificate from this course."
21187,Thank you so much.
21188,"Very nice introduction to bayesian statistics, the materials have some level of depth, and the tests and assignment are highly available for beginners."
21189,Thank you for your programme. It is designed to provide a compact but complete preparation.
21190,"I really like this course, it have a lot of advance finance."
21191,really helpful
21192,"Its a very good class to learn to use SQL in a systematic manner, even if you had used SQL or are completely new. The two Database ( Terradata and Cognition) gave a lot of valuable practice."
21193,Great first year calculus course!
21194,"good course, very suitable for frenchman"
21195,"One of the best courses I ever had an opportunity to encounter on Coursera. It is an insightful, enlightening journey into the cultural and philosophical heritage of humanity. The professor opens up and talks in a most compelling way about all major ideas of modernity that you have heard about. His course is a must for anyone who wants to be an intellectual person."
21196,Great course
21197,Very useful insight and definitely a knowledge enhancing course
21198,Thumbs up for this course!
21199,"Amazing opportunity to develop ideas in different subjects around the theme of modernity. The course covers many authors,and though never gets superficial. The best part is Professor Both and the pieces of reading in an emotional, thrilling way. Thanks Coursera!"
21200,I did enjoining this program. Any thanks.
21201,Great introduction for people with very limited programming experience. Appropriately challenging and interesting.
21202,His course helps a person individually and also help them to promote health and well being of the society. It also develops entrepreneurial ideas in the new field of organic farming.
21203,It a very essential course and I believe that every individual must do.
21204,Course was really very interesting and gives me a basic information about so and it's history!Thank you very much for this course!
21205,A very challenging and worthwhile course! The homework assignment took hours but taught me a lot. Highly recommended if you have the time and effort to commit to this course.
21206,It's got the theory but it also has lots of real-life experience and practical tips and examples.
21207,In excellent overview of the subject. Ordered the book - found an older edition copy for cheap on an auction site - and found it invaluable on exam. His class is less sleep inducing and more fun than most.
21208,A little bit too easy
21209,"The video are very static, the content good but the course progresses in a rather slow way.The thick Dutch accent and the lack of diversity in the speakers profile is rather paramounting (but I have followed only the first three chapters)."
21210,Perfect course to learn Machine Learning.
21211,Very concentration! The teacher demonstrates the basic concept and acknowledge that every engineer should know. Very impressive. Thanks!
21212,"Useful course, very funny thanks to Charles :)"
21213,World-class!
21214,I really like it! It helped me to established the abilities to create a game-world.
21215,"The course is a very good introduction to Python for data exploration and management.That being said, it focused too much on categorical data analysis, and I felt the transition to quantitative/continuous data was not very well done.Moreover, some more explanations about several Python functions or coming choice could be better explained.But it's encouraging to see this type of statistical course for Python and not R!! Again!"
21216,Amazing course! one of the best courses on couresera!
21217,"I really appreciate all the stuff, facilitators and brains behind this course!"
21218,It's my FAVORITE COURSERA COURSE!!! Thanks a lot all authors for this amazing course!!!!
21219,I felt overwhelmed by too much information all of a sudden in each lesson.
21220,I worked with Python in 2001 for my first job at a hedgefund company. It was refreshing to work on the basis of the language and to refresh santa and new libraries. Python is a powerful language and Or. Chuck has made it easy for beginners as well as for advanced members to quickly get up to speed.
21221,Great course!
21222,Great course. I learned a lot. Very well organized and presented.
21223,Wonderful Course. Not to learn a lot of new and interesting stuff. And interested with quite a lot of intelligent and enthusiastic earners.
21224,"His is rich, fully packed with the exact knowledge needed to succeed in music industry."
21225,I love this course because it gives a basic knowledge of Chinese medicine. It enhanced my understanding towards the complex concepts.
21226,A very interesting course focus on the true life with data science tears. His course is more about the day to day life and problem to manage a data science team and less about pure organization. The financial aspects are not covered by Jeff nor the complex problems of people organization. I have noticed that I was the sole person to post on the forum.
21227,"His course was delivered 6-months behind schedule and the assignment half-way through the course can't even be completed due to technical problems and floppy content. When students try to seek support to fix the issues, nothing is done and they receive no response. The specialization started so well, but the care that was taken to craft the specialization course content in the beginning has been lost in the later courses."
21228,"I was very disappointed by this course, in fact a bit more so than by the ""Unwritten"" course that has run concurrently with this one. I was **very** put off by the professor's simply opening his book and trying to remember what he'd said there and then, in front of his audience, reduce it down to a viewed talk. He needed to put some effort and thought into understanding his topic from the point of view of an audience that is inevitably very, very different from the one he had in mind (if any, in particular) as he was writing the book. Of he didn't have time for proper preparation, he should have found another medium for flogging his publications.By and large, everyone who is from the of (I'm not) and who reaches about the of constitution emphasized its uniqueness. Indeed, they have a point: it was the first (and, admirably, the shortest) modern written constitution. However, uniqueness isn't unique among nations; all nations are somehow unique. Understanding a nation (including this constitution) has to involve looking at both hum-drum formality as well as uniqueness. I felt that the course would have been more substantial if it had been built on the obvious fact that the of revolutionaries were ""Englishmen fighting for an Englishman's rights."" And, indeed, what they created had both the worst and the best traits that England's historical jurisprudence offered. Social stare decision has been a major stumbling-block not only for common-law countries but as well for countries that follow other sorts of jurisprudence.The course was embarrassing bad."
21229,"Comprehensive, thorough, intriguing, every minute well spent."
21230,excellent introduction to the political and social issues that the Slim and indeed the world at large is still resolving
21231,Awesome course. Short and sweet and straight to the point.
21232,Great course!
21233,"For an undergraduate course it's good - my only comment is on delivery - quotations given verbally might have been better if shown on screen to drive them home.I hope the professor will do a military history course that analyze war more particularly now that we have the broad strokes. By interest is piquet from this course and I want to know more about specific wars/battles. I am also interested in war prior to 1500, esp. ancient civilization."
21234,Very useful information presented well by a knowledgeable professor who keeps you interested in the course. Thank you

21242,"Video production was very good, and good balance of video and ""blackguard"". Also, a good balance of practical stuff (like how to cook healthy stuff) and theory (what is a mon-saccharide, and how do they combine to form di-saccarides). Well done!"
21243,"Great business practice advice, but not very rich with real life practice, like print review, professional colour theme chosen, etc.Achieved: 2017-02-26"

21262,I liked it very much
21263,"His was a fantastic course in typography. I learned so much about ""font"". I never imagined all the work that goes into creating new typeface. I was impressed by the history, the process and the strong messages behind each typeface."
21264,Very good explanations. Concepts are presented in a comfortable way. To much instructive.
21265,"His is a great introduction to global health and to the University of Copenhagen. I'm thinking of doing a Masters in the field and have been considering different universities. Having done some of this online course, I"
21266,Needs more practical examples.Like project for free.
21267,I will never look at advertising with the same eyes. It made me understand a lot of our current society and economy. Really suggested if you want to become a more informed citizen and consumer.
21268,I really appreciated for all your effort to created this classroom.His class helped me so much;in addition to this experience I am also very happy to attend your classroom.I have upgrade my confidence since I started to take this classroom.

21275,Great introduction to patron.A bit long if coming from other languages but still useful.
21276,difficult at times - particularly wresting with Handlebars the temple library- but well worth the time devoted to understanding and using what is taught here.
21277,"Excellent course, I've learnt a lot. Maybe the laws are a little ""do what I'm saying"", but that is only if you are looking for the Certificate. Of you dedicate enough time to read and ""play"" a little bit, it's a very complete course."
21278,I am learning so many tools things on this course! Love it!
21279,Perfect!
21280,Very useful and interesting

The impact has been so positive on me that I can now better understand the path behind the material and enjoy the process of becoming a software engineer(?), I don't know but the sky certainly is not the limit for me : )Thank you Coursera, of, and Or. Chuck and his staff!In to the next section!"
21284,In excellent introductory course. Emily are Parlor are awesome teachers.
21285,"Very vague, abstract ideas in the lectures. Would be much better if more real-life examples and scenario were used in the lectures to convey those abstract ideas."

21293,"Initially, I thought the 9-week course was boring. I actually did not start it on time and was busy to start viewing the video. However when I started on them, I actually found myself very much engaged to the topics being discussed. I ended up finishing the lectures earlier than schedule."
21294,Perfect and Or Chuck makes that course so interesting...Thanks Or CHUCK !
21295,"I loved this course and am taking the next one in the series. I learned so much, I took so much more away from the reading than working on it on my own. I want to profoundly thank the people who took the time to put this course together, in particular the professor. Her covent lectures and intermittent quires kept me paying attention and on my toes. Thank you!"
21296,The tests are a little too easy.
21297,Very helpful to those biologist who wants to start a career in bioinformatics
21298,I have done 30 courses on-line and at least 8 verified in different platforms. His is the most powerful one. Of you like engineering and you like modeling . Must do it
21299,Very well organized course materials.
21300,"Great theme for a course, perfect idea, but I had some issues with execution of it. To, these are the issues:"
21301,"Truly an honor to be taught by professor Shapiro, who, with a very precise methodology, was able to pass through major political theories of modern era. Highly recommended!"

21317,"It has been several years since I have attained a bachelor degree in business administration with emphasis in finance, and I felt that this course could refresh my knowledge as well as serve as an introduction me to Pale. However, the course turned out to be so much more. Professor Miller's enthusiasm kept me glued to the subject, while inspiring me to read and learn more. I was constantly able to make notes on various ideas that would hit me for implementation, within my line of work, into the real world. The concepts were presented from all sides; including historic, theoretical, and practical; enlightening within a dimension of relevance."
21318,loved this course.
21319,"Run, short and concise. I finished it in one night and I loved it."
21320,"Great beginner course for Arduino. People that are experienced with programming will probably end up lipping through some of the video pretty fast or shipping some of them because the programming is very basic, that aside I found the lessons very interesting and would recommend them for anyone new to Arduino or wanting a refreshed"

21332,nice course and nice explanation
21333,The course material was quite insightful giving glimpses of what magic was perceived as during the Middle Ages. I particularly liked the material on witchcraft and Astrology. I hope there will be second part to this course! Thank you all the professors and other members of the team. I enjoyed every part of it!
21334,"His is one of the best courses I have ever taken. The lectures are fantastic, with a great structure. The course material is presented in an extremely simple way, even the most difficult machine learning algorithms. I am heading into Data Science industry and this course is the best one out there - a must-go-through for anybody who wants to do any Machine Learning."
21335,Enjoyed it - concise and allows for further research
21336,"First, Him is funny and a great teacher. Plus, it is a great course to enhance my career and to work my skill."
21337,"His was my first attempt at a MOOC, and I think I'm spoiled. His is the just right format and just right medium for learning these skill. The class demonstration video are simple enough to really demonstrate the concepts. The exercises are also well formulated to help get the concepts across effectively in this medium."
21338,Great class! Very information and enjoyable. One of the best I've taken on Coursera.
21339,Great! very well structures.
21340,Not for beginners as promised. You need strong statistical skill to understand it.
21341,I really liked it!
21342,Wish they had more assignment to test you.
21343,Highly recommend this class. Helps one understand themselves so that they can lead others
21344,"His course was incredibly interesting and information, even for an introduction class. The layout made a lot of sense even for someone with only a little bit of experience in typography.

21345,Very good course! Thank you Or. Chuck!
21346,Learned a lot!
21347,Very useful!
21348,Or Chuck is extremely dedicated to teaching and clarity. His personality is very welcoming and he speaks clearly and thoughtfully. Some of the 'younger' MOOC instructor need to learn this to be more effective.I am going to try R Programming again.. but I wish John's Hopkins would take a few of Or. Chuck's course for inspiration on how to be more accessible.Thanks Or. C! PLEASE KEEP of FREE
21349,"wonderful course, very helpful with basic knowledge of graphics design usage of elements and forms and terminologies. Thank you, the video were very helpful and very insightful and easy to follow. I'd so love to carry on taking more courses that can help broaden my knowledge"
21350,"Grief and clear, very easy to understand"
21351,It was quiet mathematical for a beginner like me.
21352,"His class is amazing, information and full of useful information. Highly recommend this class."
21353,His is a very useful course that apart from the video lectures presents a comprehensive bibliography supporting key points raised during the study. The delivery of information and a means of control and organization of the forum and peer review process appear to confirm with important contemporary standards of English-language teaching. I'd certainly recommend the course to non-native speakers of English who need to acquire academic literacy skill.
21354,Sweet introduction to unity 5.
21355,"Disappointed with lectures-structures data rather than real life examples-professor is speaking monotonous, without passion-no visualisation on the discussed topic"
21356,"His is a useful course, but please look into the spelling and grammatical errors in the text."
21357,Must awesome. it simply needs to provide information on assignment when keyboard sucks.
21358,"The knowledge share is really good, thought provoking as well as precise and straight to the point. Although, it is very basic, it refreshed your minds on veterinary practice and new things are learnt."
21359,Auto grade could be better.
21360,The professors handled the classes exceptionally well. I thank all of them for helping me learn something. But I felt the course a little hard as the documentation needed to be referred properly to work with the objects.
21361,Hello thank you to you who had this idea because I found the course very instructive. I could learn a lot about the Japanese universities and somehow on the lifestyle of the Japanese. But what I wish most To the world is to be accepted in the university of tokyo.Thank you all that God bless you
21362,"Perfect course, perfect professor."
21363,"I recommend the course, for anyone who understands some path and science. The quires and writing exercises were challenging in different ways, and helped me to develop my skill in computing, understanding, looking at data, and practice sharing in the enterprise of science.I would give my performance maybe a B since I did very well in some areas (I understood the science very well, and mainly acid the quires) but not so well in others (in the writing assignment I kept getting into trouble with the deadline and the interface, and in trading other people's papers sometimes I wasn't very thoughtful in my judgments and statements.)Also, I said I understood the science very well, but also I know I could have looked more thoroughly at some parts of the science. Especially about the analysis of radiation as it interact with the atmosphere, I think I went too fast, and relied on looking at a graph to get myself through the lesson. I am sure the graph has a solid foundation, but I would like to review that part of the course or look at that information more deeply.There is a term project at the end that took me by surprise and I procrastinator on it - bad habit.I decided to go ahead and purchase the course since I am willing to support the course. By finances are really not good but considering the amount of time I put into the course, I should be able to afford that much."
21364,Interesting!
21365,It is the most complete Music Therapy Online course I have ever seen.
21366,Great Course and serves as a good starting point for web designing.
21367,I am recommending this course to everyone I know. Thank you so much! You helped me on many levels!
21368,"Is usual, excellent way of teaching. Deep it up Coursera (Y)"
21369,"Great course, a lot of fun with the practical assignment"
21370,"Really helpful, but the quit is a little difficult. I think class would better be extend to 5 weeks."
21371,Great curriculum and instructor.
21372,it was an amazing class. perfect class to take for who works full time. few additional notions every week. the teacher patiently repeats several time envy sentence to help with pronunciation. Thanks
21373,"I suggest to add the option to allow some students write project code on their own, instead of just read and run."
21374,"His is by far the best course out of four ones in this specialization, as to me it is very practical inside engineering firms. Also, both instructor described the topics very well. The second assignment can be considered as a real exercise for currently employed individuals who are taking the course."
21375,"Great course, learned a lot about financial markets in a fun way!"
21376,"There was a wealth of good information, strategics and ideas for working with children that have cutis."
21377,"Very interesting subject. I was really waiting for a course like that but, with all due respect and acknowledgment to the instructor, their is many ways this course could have been an inspiring and exciting journey. Vincent"
21378,Run course. I learned a lot about nutrition and got quite a few easy healthy recipe. His course actually inspired me to cook for my family.I'm hoping there's a second part that will come out in the future.
21379,"Great course, easy to follow and entertaining professor."
21380,FUN COURSE WHICH I ENJOYED QUITE A BIT.
21381,His course is a fantastic resource which I would highly recommend for potential practitioner of machine learning. In particular the advice for debugging machine learning systems is huge useful.
21382,A very helpful course in understanding how business is run from an analytical point of view.
21383,His is one the best course to learn Cryptography. His course is specially design for basic level to higher level.
21384,Great Course.Amazing insight provided.Would be helpful if free ebook would be provided along with the course.Happy that I did this course :)
21385,"I have already given my feed back. Excellent. To words other than thanks, thanks, thanks to all who made me learn the basic statistics from your well learned team."
21386,"great class, interesting material that I'd like to have as reference documentation"
21387,"His a decent course, perhaps something I should go back through and do again."
21388,Instructor doesn't seem to be passionate about giving the lecture
21389,It was very clear and detailed.The Instructor's examples and demonstrations made it easy to understand. Great Introduction course.
21390,"clear and specific, better teaching than my university"
21391,His course covers a lot of ground and provides some interesting research to back up the information. I have read several books on happiness and I still learned some interesting things.I recommend it if you are at all interested in happiness as a subject of study.
21392,Great energy in the course. A lot of fun to work on.
21393,Great Course to get Started with.
21394,"Not very applicable -just a bunch of concepts.It feels like a very disorganised course.Paul Harris is extremely repetition and takes so much time to get to the point. Sometimes he over-explains unnecessary things. His lectures need serious upgrade.Lectures speak too slow, I have to use the 1.x speed not to fall asleep."
21395,Concepts are explained clearly and without getting distracted by too much path. The quires and assignment are useful too.
21396,The teacher is not very good at explaining things in simpler terms. The lessons were kind of hard to understand.
